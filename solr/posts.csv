14vrpiu,Pride and Prejudice by you already know who,"SPOILERS!! THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING!!

When I tell you I am so glad to be freed from the shackles of this book. I enjoyed it, but it was so long to read I can't help but be glad it's over.

I doubt I have much to be said on the book that hadn't already been said, so I think I'll give my opinions on the characters instead:

> The Bennets

Mrs Bennet - Literally unhinged

Mr Bennet - Unbothered but probably should be

Jane - The least problematic person in this god forsaken family. Gossips with Lizzie about literally everything. I like how close the two are.

Lizzie - In her hot girl summer era throughout the entire book. Pulling men left and right. Go off, girlboss 💅

Mary - I feel bad for her. Literally got called clapped throughout the entire book. 

Kitty - If your role model in life is Lydia, you have huge problems that need to be addressed

Lydia - Literally an embarrassment

> The Bingleys / Hursts

Mr Bingley - Literally did nothing wrong the entire book. He just wanted to be loved 🥹

Miss Bingley - I ain't never seen a more down bad bitch in my life. Literally a pick me but had the audacity to call Lizzie one. Darcy doesn't want you, babe, pack it up!

The Hursts - Irrelivant and low key rude

> The Darcy's

Mr Darcy - Self help king. We love a man who works on himself

Miss Darcy - Adorable

> Other

Mr Collins - Literally just die I hate you, you are so annoying

Mrs Collins - Your marriage was a mistake

Lady De Bourgh - I will dance on your grave

Wickham - Literally what is wrong with you. You are the biggest problem in the entire book.

The Gardiners - We love

I can't think of anyone else right now...

Edit: Not u/SchonFrauen giving me a gold! Thank you so much!😊🥹

Also thank you the anonymous person who gave me the rocket 💕",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/14vrpiu/pride_and_prejudice_by_you_already_know_who/,2023-07-10T11:44:50Z,135,265,RomanceBooks,Pride and Prejudice,POST

1620j2f,The ultimate showdown - what’s your absolute favorite Pride and Prejudice retelling?,"Help, I’ve fallen down a hyperfixation hole and I don’t want to get out. Don’t send help, I just need more shovels, maybe a backhoe (😏). 

It all started with the stuff your earbuds day… I took a chance on {Expecting His Propsal by P. O. Dixon}, which is part of a Pride and Prejudice  variations series… it was fun, but didn’t quite scratch the itch when it comes to my love of Pride and Prejudice. I’ve read a few other retellings in my time and have some on my TBR - one being {Pride and Prejudice and Planets by Renata McMann and Summer Hanford}, it looks intriguing but the reviews have me a little hesitant. The last one I read was {Power and Prestige by Sarah McConkie} - this was P&P with magic, which I enjoyed, but wanted more from.

So now I’m on a (side) quest to find the ultimate/best retelling. I’m not looking for a list of retellings, I want to know *your* absolute favorite! 

All genres welcome, closed door or explicit, traditional or genderbent, any and all pairings - I just want your favorite and why! 

Rules: I’m talking about books where you know it’s a P&P retelling; the plot points are similar, maybe the character names.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1620j2f/the_ultimate_showdown_whats_your_absolute/,2023-08-26T17:02:23Z,67,54,RomanceBooks,Pride and Prejudice,POST
nhb8ky,I just read Pride and Prejudice for the first time. I need more Mr. Darcy’s 💕💕💕,"Edit: Thank you all so so much for the amazing recommendations! I am so excited to try out new books, shows, and fanfictions. I did not expect to receive as much love as I have on this post--in fact, I was nervous making it because I felt bad for not reading this novel sooner. This again just reminds me of why I LOVE THIS SUB so much. Y'all are some of the most open, caring, and supportive people there are. Thanks so much <3 

I have never read classic romance because I did not think I could enjoy it. BOY WAS I WRONG. I am in love with Mr. Darcy, most ardently (Yes I also watched the 2005 movie adaptation!! The hand flex. His smile. I’m deceased).

I enjoyed the novel so much, and not just for Elizabeth and Darcy. I also loved Jane and her Mr. Bingly. I loved how dramatic Mrs. Bennet is, and how sarcastic Mr. Bennet can be. The drama, the letters, the setting... it was just such a beautiful read. I know I’m so so so late and so many people love and have read this book but hey, what can I say. At least I got to it eventually! 

What novel should I read next? I’d love something similar to this one where there’s a book plus an amazing movie adaptation to accompany it.

qiyjss,Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen,"Today I finished Pride and Prejudice. I had borrowed it from the local library for writing inspiration. I've heard about the book but I didn't know about it. I absolutely love it now. My library had an edition of a pocket size book of 200 pages. I want to keep it. I won't, of course. But, I want to keep it in my hands forever. 

There are three things that made me love this book. 

It is the **funniest** book I've read. I laughed so hard. Even in the last pages where I expected a sweet finale, I would laugh! Some things were ridiculous but after I finished it, it's all bound together very well. I didn't expect to laugh this much. 

It is a **safe**, light book. It included no sexual assault, murders, stalkers etc. It was a refreshing change for me! I think it is my new comfort book. Really. Now having finished it, I appreciate it even more. While reading it, I expected something terrible to happen and shock me. A friend even messed with me and said I'd see something surprising in the end. And I read it thinking oh no, what if he dies. But, the book is lovely, lovely, lovely. 

**Mr. Darcy**. Sigh. Mr. Darcy, indeed. Now, I get it. He is the original grouch. Definition of heart that melt for the heroine. 

I haven't watched the movie yet. Should I or should I stay with this wonderful euphoria the book has given me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/qiyjss/pride_and_prejudice_by_jane_austen/,2021-10-30T10:13:43Z,48,112,RomanceBooks,Pride and Prejudice,POST

xuou5o,Pride and Prejudice 2: Electric boogaloo," I started reading again, and decided to get over my hatred for romance books. I picked up Pride and Prejudice in the library, and found out, that slow burn, Classic Regency novels are amazing.

So please, suggest me books that are: written in 3rd person, have lovable side characters, a more mature fmc, and the mmc becomes more and more likeable as the story goes on.

uf2nqc,I just finished Pride and Prejudice and it's incredible. Have you guys ever heard of this book?,"Kidding. But really, I just got done reading it for the first time. 

I read the first half a few times as a fidget/comfort. Could have sworn I finished it, but I realized this week I was blending in the movie's ending (watched/read at the same-ish time). 

I cant believe the realness and intelligence of Lizzie's thoughts when she's slowly reforming her opinions of Mr. Darcy & Mr. Wickam. I don't know if I even still read it as a romance book, because the romance isn't the point. Its just the vehicle of the point. 

Anyway I'm very surprised to be someone who reads Pride and Prejudice and needs to write a 10-page paper just to process it. 

I spent half of today trying get more of it somehow. Find retellings, a decent podcast, something. But then I remembered some 15 year old to asked the internet for more movies like Juno. I felt a sad for her because she was about to go on a quest just to learn that there was only one movie like Juno. 

Now I cannot for the life of me find the person who said this. But I think it applies here-

""Too many books are undeservingly forgotten, but no books are undeservingly remembered""

Also sorry if this flowed weird. Im pretty high atm.



Edit bc I wanted to but couldn't explain this earlier:

I thought of and approached it like I would approach reading the original version of a fairytale. To me Jane Austen was just like the Grimm Brothers of romance novels. Mostly getting credit for being the first to put basic stories of a genre in to print.  

But no, I was of course mistaken and she's fucking brilliant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/uf2nqc/i_just_finished_pride_and_prejudice_and_its/,2022-04-30T03:32:57Z,51,189,RomanceBooks,Pride and Prejudice,POST
vmap4q,Pride and Prejudice level of love declaration,"Hellooo fellow romance lovers,
I'm after some recommendations with a specific trope(?) of love declarations where the MMC can't keep it in anymore that he's in love with the FMC. 
 (SPOILERS FOR PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AHEAD)


The part where Mr Darcy goes ""I love you, most ardently"", is hands down one of my favourite romance moments of all time and I just want something that hits me in the feels in the same way ( I know he botched the proposal but I still love it). 
I haven't really been able to get into reading anything in the past few weeks and I just need a good angsty romance. I just love when the MMC falls first and falls hard.

I am a lover of historical fiction but am open to reading absolutely anything with any type of relationships, and even if you know any good fanfics with this please recommend them. 


 
Some books that kind of remind me of this ( potential spoilers ahead?) are:


Slightly Dangerous by Mary Balogh

When He Was Wicked by Julia Quinn

rpt8js,"Stories like Pride and Prejudice, but in a very specific way","Hey y'all, I'm looking for romances with a dynamic like Elizabeth and Darcy's but in a very specific way -- where the FMC doesn't like the MMC for some reason (can be legitimate or a misunderstanding I don't care), so she's always being rude to him but he's *so into it*. 

Thinking specifically about the scene where Elizabeth is playing the piano and just being so mean to Darcy, but he's like ""yes this rude one I must marry her.""

o8h5px,a lovely book kind of like Pride and Prejudice with a dash of Men in Black,"I just finished {His Quiet Agent, by Ada Maria Soto} and it was so nice I wanted to tell you all about it, especially since I remember some of you like low/no steam.  M/M, contemporary, secret agent but mostly the busy work/lunch room part of the secret agent experience, no sex, slow burn/getting to know each other, and I freaking loved it.  Also, I'm pretty sure it's the first asexual romance I've read.  (One of the main characters is demisexual, and the story is third person but from his point of view, and the other is asexual.  And their gradually increasing closeness reminded me of a parody trailer that was like 'longing looks from across the room, and ooh, their hands touched!')

It reminds me of Jane Austen novels (how people get to know each other, also Darcy's asocial tendencies turned up to 11), Waiting for the Flood (an interested guy orbiting a quiet guy, and a reading experience that felt like a comfy blanket), Masterchef kind of (lots of using food to nurture and get to know each other better), Brigadoon just a smidge for spoilery reasons, and Men in Black (the break room specifically of MiB, also what even is this Agency, who are these people, nobody at the main character level seems to really know but I'm ok with that).",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/o8h5px/a_lovely_book_kind_of_like_pride_and_prejudice/,2021-06-26T19:16:55Z,5,11,RomanceBooks,Pride and Prejudice,POST

I am having the time of my life listening in on the lives of the Bennet’s and the mother’s attempts to marry off all daughters, the amazing banter and chatter between certain characters, and so far my favourite (which is as far as I am in this book lol), lovely Lizzie rejecting the cousin flat out cold lmao.

Blurb:

« A woman goes head-to-head with the CEO of a corporation threatening to destroy her neighborhood in this fresh and modern retelling of Pride and Prejudice by debut author Nikki Payne.
 
Liza B.—the only DJ who gives a jam—wants to take her neighborhood back from the soulless property developer dropping unaffordable condos on every street corner in DC. But her planned protest at a corporate event takes a turn after she mistakes the smoldering-hot CEO for the waitstaff. When they go toe-to-toe, the sparks fly—but her impossible-to-ignore family thwarts her every move. Liza wants Dorsey Fitzgerald out of her hood, but she’ll settle for getting him out of her head.
 
At first, Dorsey writes off Liza Bennett as more interested in performing outrage than acting on it. As the adopted Filipino son of a wealthy white family, he’s always felt a bit out of place and knows a fraud when he sees one. But when Liza’s protest results in a viral meme, their lives are turned upside down, and Dorsey comes to realize this irresistible revolutionary is the most real woman he’s ever met. »

m50sta,Very entertaining alternate version of Pride & Prejudice 🍿 🍿 🍿,"[Lost in Austen (2008)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1117666/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)  \- 4 part mini-series,  **4** stars (It steadily improves from the first episode.)

In this alternate version of *Pride and Prejudice*, a modern woman is transported into her favorite book and makes a hash of things. Some surprising truths are revealed about the characters. 

All of the actors and actresses were good, but Hugh Bonneville (“Downton Abbey”) as Mr. Bennett and Tom Mison (“Sleepy Hollow”) as Mr. Bingley were both outstanding in their roles. Lots of lines had me laughing, although not all of the attempted humor hit its mark. 

Two favorite quotes, both from Darcy: “When my duties are discharged I will find you, for there is more to say, if only the same words, over and over again,” and later, “Not one heartbeat do I forget.”

rnf0jx,Do you think I would enjoy Pride & Prejudice?,"I exceeded my goal to read at least 24 books this year (I read over 30)! Yay! So, now I'm trying to make some reading plans for 2022. 

Pride & Prejudice sounds like one of those classics that most who enjoy romance have read. Two themes I hate in my books are: 1. Sexist bullshit (even if it was historically accurate. I don't like getting bummed out while reading.) Ideally, the protagonists in a historical romance would be fighting against the sexism of the time. 2. I hate it when the couple spends a significant portion of the book apart because of miscommunication. If the conflict could be solved by the 2 of them sitting down and having a healthy 5 minute conversation, I get annoyed. So, knowing that, should I read Pride & Prejudice? Is it as good as people say? Even if those 2 themes are present, is the book good enough to make up for those things? 

I would really appreciate your thoughts. Thanks!

jm1hxc,Looking for a book Pride and “Prejudiceesque”?,"I’m looking for something with the same sort of trope that Pride and Prejudice follows, the starting off with an apparent dislike and then them both realising how wrong they are, (a very rudimentary overview). 

It doesn’t have to be in a historical setting and I do like fantasy so it wouldn’t bother me if it was set in that type of scenario. I also like dark romance. 

Thank you!

Edit: I’d also like to add for me P&P is one of the most ultimate romance books as “basic” as it may be nothing has ever topped it for me.

li8yco,Pride and Prejudice is a marvel.,"I started reading Pride and Prejudice last December, but discontinued. I started it again January with a goal to finish it before buying other books. When I am halfway through the book, I can't put it down. The book is that engaging.

The characterization of Darcy and Elizabeth, showing the faults of one another and still falling for each other is outstanding. 

The pride and justification for that, the prejudice and realization of the mistake and love the other half even in fault. It is brilliant.

It became easily one of my favourite books.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/li8yco/pride_and_prejudice_is_a_marvel/,2021-02-12T11:07:43Z,596,5549,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST
fih47b,Pride and Prejudice is absolutely breathtaking,"Yesterday I started with Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and after reading all day long into late at night I finished it this morning. Now I can't stop thinking about it and I feel the need to write. 

This book is perfect in a every way. The characters feel so human, the dialogue is incredibly funny but really moving at other times. I learned so much about Jane Austen's times and how every little bit of etiquette can make a huge difference in terms of the impression you make socially. Above all I was so fascinated by the female perspective which was so genuine, not concerned about representation or agendas or anything like that of today's times. It just felt natural and honest.

While reading I just felt real emotion growing inside me and this rarely happens even though I read a lot. I honestly think it made me a better person overall.

Austen's dialogue was so absorbing that I felt as though I were seated between Elizabeth and Darcy during their witty exchanges, or strolling alongside them in the country, breathing in the same fresh air as them. And then the film: Kiera Knightley is just beautiful to watch, but add to this an equally beautiful soundtrack and cinematography, and I'm quite simply spellbound.

*Now* I'm starting to see why England boasts a rich literary tradition; a very different experience indeed.

8dxb7f,[Pride and Prejudice] The pastor at Barbara Bush’s funeral just compared her to Caroline Bingley,"He said Pride and Prejudice was her favorite book, and then quoted this line: “How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!”

The context:

>Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.”

>No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement…

So this is a passage about a woman who talks about her love of books but never actually reads them, being cited by a pastor who either never read this book, or missed the point of it altogether. Bravo! I think Austen would enjoy that immensely.

sc1gsz,Pride and prejudice was amazing,"I suffer from dyslexia. Reading is and has always been a chore. I found a few books in my youth ( the Harry Potter series) that I found good enough to power thru.

On Christmas I got myself a IPad and went to the apple bookstore and got myself the free version of Pride and prejudice along with the free audio book. 

This was literally life changing. Having someone read to me while following along had made reading a JOY. I couldn’t put it down. I never thought I would be able to read “old English” book (english isn’t my first language) and actually enjoy it. It was a breeze, so refreshing.


Pride and prejudice was a great read, I got attached to the characters and their development, the subtil change in the way they talk and think and act. The main plot made me fall in love with Mr. Darcy but the side plots were just has captivating.

Thought it was going to be an enlightening read but I didn’t expect Darcy to call Elizabeth ugly? I almost choked. I had to Google who the true pairing is because why you gotta do that bro!!!!!!!!! 

The first chapter alone between Mrs Bennet and Mr Bennet had me in tears! Nobody told me that Darcy and Elizabeth has an enemies to lovers plot line and I’m sCREAMING what does Jane Austen drink with her tea? 

The romance hasn’t even started yet but I finally understand why so many people here love Austen and her works, particularly this book.

I think I might dive deeper into Austen’s other works after this. What’s something as close as possible to the humor here or someone who has the same character as Elizabeth?

12axlhx,Pride and Prejudice is a true English literary masterpiece,"I finally got around to reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Slow at times, throughly engaging at others, Pride and Prejudice is a literary masterpiece that is worthy of all the praise it has received.

The novel revolves around the family of Bennets with Elizabeth Bennet the principal character. Mrs Bennet is eager to marry off her daughters when Mr Bingley and his friend Mr Darcy happen to arrive in their neighbourhood. 

The characters were well fleshed and drawn out. This was true especially for the two main characters - Elizabeth and Mr Darcy. The character development both of them go throughout the length of the book is so well written. The interactions between the two also formed the most pleasing passages of the novel. Austen provided commentaries by Elizabeth after every event in a book. Every other character was also thoroughly etched out. 

To say the book was hard to read would be an understatement. Jane Austen's prodigious ability to write such long sentences that are to be read more than once to absorb them completely, are testament to her writing prowess. But the satisfaction after rejoicing in what she wrote justified all the effort employed in reading her passages. 

There are also many memorable quotes that have been endlessly repeated and memorized. Overall, it truly feels like a triumph of English literature and worthy of its prestigious standing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12axlhx/pride_and_prejudice_is_a_true_english_literary/,2023-04-03T20:57:52Z,57,174,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST
1559e71,Not loving Pride and Prejudice,"It's summer reading time here and I'm completing an adult challenge with others at my local library. Long story short, I needed to read something that was outside of my typical reading genres and as I've never read any of the British classics I picked this one on a whim. I hate it, and it would totally go I the DNF pile had it not have been for this challenge. I find myself checking out often while reading and the audiobook isn't much better. Are there any movies that are closely aligned to the book as a third option for the story.

10mloz5,Can't get into Pride and Prejudice?,"Ok, so I know not every book is for everyone. But still, I've heard so much great stuff about this book and as a literature student who will need to study this later this year, I wanted to read it now.

But even after 30-40 pages in I can't find it interesting enough! And it took me like 3 days to read this 40 pages. Compare that to Sherlock Holmes novels/short stories which I read earlier this month, I read about 30-50 pages a day, even 100 pages at once (Hound of the Baskervilles). I read the pages faster for those books as well, for Pride and Prejudice I can't read that faster, perhaps because the language is a bit more decorated.

xhpupk,[Update] I finished reading 'Pride and Prejudice' for the first time.,"Thank you to everyone who commented on various social customs and the like that I may not have been aware of and improved my understanding of the novel as I read it.

I ended up enjoying the book so much more than I expected. My school days of suffering through various classics that did not appeal to me in a manner that didn't encourage enjoyment of the books for just reading them for entertainment's value has put me off choosing to read any classic books of my own volition. I was half expecting a dry romance but the characters were so vibrant and quirky and flawed.

Anyway, I apologise for my younger self's disdain of classic literature. I have been proved wrong in this case.

zu8bmz,Spies And Prejudice by Talia Vance Versus the classic book Pride And Prejudice,"I love to read Young Adult Fiction, some Harlequin Romances and certain types of Nonfiction such as quotes in themes and the Chicken Soup series. I love spy books, tv shows, movies and games. I love the factor of good guys trying to right the wrongs and trying to stop bad guys from hurting anyone else.

I saw Spies And Prejudice by Talia Vance at Barnes And Noble in Young Adult Fiction. (This was years ago.) I remember trying to read Pride And Prejudice and not being able to handle it. Spies And Prejudice seemed like it would be a spy version of it.

I was feeling sort of iffy about the book. Do I check it out or not? I didn't want to not get it based on not being able to understand Pride And Prejudice. I did what I do every time I am iffy about a book at a bookstore or a library. I sat down and started to read the book.

I read the information outside of the book first. That gets me knowing or it gets my curiosity growing. I read the first chapter. If my curiosity has not been destroyed but it has not changed to ""Oh wow! I want to buy this book!"", then I will read further. If I have delved into the book a few chapters and I do not want to buy the book, then I will return the book to the shelf.

That was not the case for this book. I. Was. Hooked. :)

First, you have this girl who has a very interesting name, Strawberry Fields. Apparently it's from a classic song. She prefers to be called Berry, another neato nickname. :) She has a father who she has been a private investigator for in his company. She keeps wanting to solve the mystery of her mom's death and no one wants to tell her or can't tell her.

She has a loyal best friend. She gets tangled in a love triangle with two boys who each want her. They're each with another security / government organization, like her. The boy who looks like he belongs on the cover of a male model magazine likes her but she does not like that he is so wanted by the other girls and seems arrogant. The other boy puts on a Prince Charming vibe and gets her trust.

I have loved this book ever since I discovered it. I wonder if I can give Pride And Prejudice another chance or if I should just enjoy Spies And Prejudice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zu8bmz/spies_and_prejudice_by_talia_vance_versus_the/,2022-12-24T11:50:07Z,19,1,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST
o5ylra,What are your thoughts on Pride and Prejudice?,"I read Pride and Prejudice a while ago and recently I saw the movie, so I've been thinking about this book way too much in my spare time lately. Do you think the writer is an actual genius for such a masterpiece or analyzing it in detail do you think it's just another book? Also, what do you think of Mr. Darcy, do you think his character is overrated?

I personally enjoyed it because of the way Mr. Darcy was, he is the type of man I'd love to have next to me. I find him to be an interesting character and I feel we could learn a lot of stuff about both Darcy and Elizabeth if we both pay close attention to them.

In case you haven't read it, Pride and Prejudice is a romantic novel (with a bit of comedy as well) that was written by Jane Austen in 1813. I personally think of it as a light-hearted novel and it centers on the relationship of Elizabeth who is the daughter of a gentleman and Darcy who is an aristocratic landowner. It also has an adaption to movies that you can find on streaming platforms such as Netflix and this one I bet will make you develop such a crush on Darcy lol!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o5ylra/what_are_your_thoughts_on_pride_and_prejudice/,2021-06-22T22:07:57Z,75,66,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST
14ak7nk,"Pride and Prejudice and The Talented Mr. Ripley, false memories and how the times do change","1) I always assumed I had read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice in high school. I have gone around for years telling people how I found the language in the book to be difficult. I have clear memories of Lydia running off with Mr. Wickham. But I am currently re-reading the book, and now I'm suspecting I never read the book at all before? The language is generally plain and straightforward with few exceptions, so basically the opposite of how I ""remember"" it, and nothing in the book rings a bell apart from Jane's cold being used by Mrs. Bennett as pretext to leave Jane at the Bingley's. 

Not to mention, I can't actually recall actually reading the book. Like I don't remember the prose in Gatsby but I do remember which teacher I read the book with and class discussions about it. But with PP? Nothing...

2) I started reading Patricia Highsmith's The Talented Mr. Ripley a few years ago and had to drop it after a few chapters in because I thought Tom was gross and vile, and it made my skin crawl to see him triumph over dickie. I guess u could say I identified with Marge or even Dickie at that point in my life. I didn't understand how a book with a nasty MC like that could be so popular.

Well, a few years on, I start the book again and I can't stop. Beginning with the first sentence I find myself identifying with Tom, the hunted underdog putting on a trying-to-please face for my betters, the outcast, etc. Sigh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14ak7nk/pride_and_prejudice_and_the_talented_mr_ripley/,2023-06-16T02:05:37Z,43,37,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST
h8a37o,"""Pride and Prejudice"" never fails to delight!!","I finished reading P&P in 2 days (my 4th time) and this timeless classic never fails to entertain. Austen's prose and characterization is terrific, every page abounds in sarcasm, wit and philosophy, and the romantic tension between characters is just impalpable. Elizabeth Bennet is sass supreme, Mr Bennet is all typical dad sarcasm, Catherine de Brough and Mr Collins never fail to irritate and Mr Darcy is the most intense and hottest man in fiction. 
I'm aware of all the accusations against Elizabeth that she changes her mind in Darcy's favour only after viewing  Pemberley. However, I have my reservations against it. I feel Elizabeth has much more depth of character than being a mere gold digger. What do you think??

z7vh1z,I’ve just finished Pride and Prejudice,"I love this story, but I can now safely say I prefer the movie to the book. Austen’s writing (this may be according to her time) is the epitome of “telling” instead of “showing”, most of the times she recites a list of adjectives as characterization, and even though I can’t accuse her of not demonstrating what she claims a character to be (I had a lot of fun reading all of Mr Collins’ silly letters and pieces of dialogue), the lack of description is really detrimental to such a good story. Some story beats lacked the drama of revelation due to this, which I believe the movie to have shown in its full potential.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/z7vh1z/ive_just_finished_pride_and_prejudice/,2022-11-29T14:24:06Z,30,0,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST

Seeing these events unfold so smoothly and elegantly was truly a joy to behold.

Also really enjoyed experiencing 19th century England through Jane Austens writing.

10uqij7,Pride and Prejudice to me is the epitome of romance novels but I recently found something about Elizabeth that I disliked,"I loved how the story progressed and how Darcy and Lizzie grew and fell for each other. It’s one of the first novels I read and I’m also very attached to the old copy of the novel that my mom passed down to me. I’ve certain sections of the novel that I re-read all the time and draw comfort from by revisiting them every year. 

I was reading chapter 60, where the main leads are discussing their relationship and growth. And there’s a section where Lizzie displays a textbook case of I’m not like other girls behaviour (for lack of a better term) when she says that Darcy must have felt attracted to her because of her impertinence as he’s always been surrounded by people who’ve courted him and that he must have been “disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your (his) approbation alone.”  

This seems to reek of a sense of superiority over other women. I think it carries over in a lot of Austen’s work. 

The only time I’ve actually seen the social craftiness of women of that period being expressed in a rational and sympathetic way is in Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Little Women with Amy. And even that is a modification to the original dialogue. 

Is it just a character flaw or how do you look at it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10uqij7/pride_and_prejudice_to_me_is_the_epitome_of/,2023-02-05T23:07:29Z,68,101,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST

If I didn’t, I would get to the bottom of a page and realized I hadn’t retained anything.

As for the content…at the risk of sounding crude, the whole book seems to be about upper class women either 1) complaining about their husbands or 2) complaining about finding a husband. 

I feel like I could watch any of the “Real Housewives of____” shows and get the same effect. 

My wife explained that it’s a commentary/satire of how things were for women at the time. I get that…I suppose Jane Austen was reflecting a woman’s inability to control her own life/social mobility during the time and setting.

But at the same time, these people are well fed and well taken care of during an era of near constant war, famine and other challenges to survival to the other 95% of the population in England during the early 1800’s.

y0q1us,"As someone who is usually not interested in romance at all, I read both *Jane Eyre* and *Pride and Prejudice*.","I enjoyed both books a lot but I solidly prefer Jane Eyre which I think is somewhat of a minority opinion. 


**Both of these books have become cornerstones of feminist literature and to *that* effect, Pride and Prejudice wins-** *P+P* is undoubtedly the stronger entry in terms of 'girl power'. Jane Eyre is basically a story of a poor girl being continually abused and manipulated, and she basically always gives her abusers more credit and generosity than they deserve. The relationship with Mr Rochester is 7 levels of fucked up, and St John is an asshole who is for some reason treated as, well, a Saint. 

Pride and Prejudice's Elizabeth knows what she wants and isn't afraid to stand up for it. She turns down very attractive marriage offers from very eligible bachelors because they don't meet her expectations of love and men. At the same time, she is willing to reflect and admit her own faults in how she has treated said men. She's headstrong, takes no shit from ""superior"" nobles like Lady Catherine and is unerringly witty.

By modern sensibilities, *P+P* is definitely the more agreeable entry. I do think that Jane Eyre should get some credit though- Jane is more genuinely flawed and in a very interesting way; she has *strong* principles that she nearly dies to adhere to, and better yet, those principles can and will be disputed by many (both by Bronte's contemporaries and by modern readers, in different ways). There's also something to be said about Jane Eyre's seething self hatred, and the general willingness to show Eyre's 'ugly emotions'- her first thought on assessing the poor, neglected, borderline abused child in her charge is 'this girl is completely untalented and unremarkable'. Considering the time period, it's kinda revolutionary in its own way how Bronte writes Eyre as someone who's genuinely flawed and not intrinsically 'heroine' material. I think Eyre's character is far more compelling although perhaps less feminist. I *could* speak more on this, but I do think there's a lot to be commended about Jane Eyre; I don't think the fact that her main motivation is love should be a bad thing, and even then she chooses love on her own terms, reconciling with Mr Rochester only after circumstances clear, and her steadfastness against St John in the face of religious and familial obligation is great too. 

**As romance novels and general vehicles for emotion, however, Jane Eyre wins:** The feelings it evokes and experiences are just so much more intense and primal. Yes, the relationship b/w Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester is fucked up and would have me calling the police in real life, but the sheer intensity and the passion of the dialogue and affection they show each other shits on anything b/w Elizabeth and Darcy tbh. I was actually super disappointed with how poorly fleshed out Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship was- every conversation b/w them was written as awkward without either of them having much to say to each other. They barely exchange a few pages of dialogue between them throughout the whole book. Even in the end, when they finally get together, their conversation largely consists of wrapping up plot details rather than any real romance. And the actual scene of them getting together is barely half of a page, and more narrated than expressed through either's dialogue! 


Compare that to Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester crying, screaming at each other in front of a stream in the middle of a storm, before starting a violent makeout sesh. Bronte really sells the intense relationship jitters- where both parties are just desperate to touch each other and be in each other's presence. The dialogue is far more passionate, and admittedly, a bit excessive and overdramatic, that it makes Austen look positively clinical by comparison. You really believe that Rochester and Eyre live and breathe for each other. 


That being said, in real life terms, Darcy and Elizabeth's relationship is *infinitely* healthier. Don't get me wrong, Mr Rochester and Jane Eyre should *not* be together, but it's to Bronte's credit how much I enjoy reading their declarations of love regardless, compared to Darcy and Elizabeth's stilted attempts at conversation.


I hope it doesn't come across as I disliked *Pride & Prejudice*, because I really did like it! I loved them both, and while I still I don't think I'm particularly interested in romance, I want to read more feminist literature. I'm currently considering Little Women but we'll see.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y0q1us/as_someone_who_is_usually_not_interested_in/,2022-10-10T21:05:09Z,47,49,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST
vc6q1y,Thoughts after reading Pride and Prejudice,"I picked up Pride and Prejudice (P&P) just after completing Crime and Punishment (C&P), expecting that it will be less of a challenging read at least in terms of not having to deal with deep, dark emotions surrounding a murder and hard poverty, and also in terms of the language (no translations involved!). 

To a large extent the first expectation was fulfilled. When I started reading P&P, I realized that I would not have to brace myself to read through all through the hardships and misfortune in C&P. In fact ... the starting few chapters almost felt a little too frivolous what with all the preoccupation with dancing and giggling and ogling at handsome, rich men. I started thinking if this is all it's going to be, then how is it any better than just a pulp romance?! Is P&P then just a glorified Mills and Boon? 

The second expectation that I had regarding the language was completely overturned. The ignoramus that I am, before starting P&P, I hadn't realized that this was late 18th, early 19th century fiction. Jane Austen would have been older than Dostoevsky's mother! And, so there was this issue of the long-winded prose - I had no prior experience in reading English this old in the original! But as I kept reading I began to realize that each time, I consciously thought of the sentence structures, I was not able to comprehend much. But if I just read and let the words flow into my mind, they would effortlessly shimmer into meaning and conjure a picture! That was pleasant. Very pleasant. And I also began to realize that notwithstanding those long-drawn sentences, there was a tremendous clarity in the descriptions of the thoughts.

When I had started feeling that P&P was a bit too frivolous, I just wanted to take a quick look ahead, and I ended up watching the movie on Netflix (starring Keira Knightley). I didn't mind too much that it kind of spoilt the plot for me because the movie made me realize that perhaps Austen had deliberately began the descriptions in that manner, to deliberately project that image of utter frivolity especially on the part of the younger Bennet girls and Mrs Bennet. And, this expectation was completely fulfilled. 

Perhaps the best qualities of the novel are: one, how all throughout the story, the various descriptions completely and very wholesomely justify the title itself; and, two, how the thoughts and feelings of the two main characters evolve. 

Austen was only around 21 years old when she completed the first draft of P&P! I wonder how much of the more mature thoughts she infused into the manuscript by the time it was published.

I’d prefer reading my discharge paperwork from the hospital. Worst part is, Most everyone seems to love it! And I really do not get it.

jwzdx1,Unpopular Pride and Prejudice Opinion," I read Pride and Prejudice back in high school and then again in uni, but for some reason why it just never clicked with me. It's a nice story, and the film adaptations were alright, but I wouldn't say that I loved it. On the other hand, I enjoyed Lady Susan, and I really love Persuasion. The whole novel never fails to give me goose bumps. It's my favourite Austen.

I was just wondering if anyone else felt the same way about Pride and Prejudice? Many people seem to love it, but I can't my finger on why I don't.

4r6ij3,(Spoilers) A funny little random thing about /r/askreddit and Pride and Prejudice,"Just spotted this myself and I found it to be pretty funny.

There's a askreddit post called ""What phrases are used by assholes"" and the 2nd most rated answer was ""Do you know who I am?"".

Then, just then, I was reading Pride and Prejudice and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, after being displeased, asked Lizzy Bennet ""Do you know who I am?"".

I find it funny that a phrase that'd mark an asshole today has been valid for more than 200 years :)

 When reading the book, I felt sad that she was the only individual among her sisters who had no similar interests and was just amused at most things. But it’s her keen wit and manner that challenges and charms Mr. Darcy, and why he can’t help but fall in love with her.

2g8tvf,"Just finished ""Pride and Prejudice""... amazed","What a great book! Many years ago I had read it and liked it; also watched and enjoyed the movie with Lawrence Olivier. Then life happened and I forgot everything about it. Reading it again after all these years, I enjoyed it 10 times more for some reason.  I suspect having been around the block (alas) a couple of times, and having seen the wretchedness of mankind makes you appreciate the book more.

Not that I was looking for any in-depth exploration of the human condition -- I read strictly as entertainment. And I must say I was thoroughly entertained. First of all, those characters! If I don't care about the characters, I'm not going to care what happens to them, and here Austen delivers in spades. The characters you root for, like Elizabeth, and the ones you love to hate... basically all the rest. Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins, Lady de Bourgh... At some times, I was half expecting Elizabeth to pull a Desert Eagle from under her petticoat and put those clowns out of their misery.

Austen takes the first handful of chapters to get the action moving, but after chapter 10 or so the plot achieves escape velocity and you are along for the ride in Spaceship Drawing-Room. The writing is hilarious, with plenty of snark from the opening sentence. And, for a 200-year old text, it's quite easy to read. I heard there is an annotated version, but unless you are a hardcore Regency maven, all you need to know is on the page. Austen even goes to the trouble of explaining the finances of the Bennet family and how and why Mr. Bennet screwed the pooch when it comes to the almighty $$$.

Which money being of course one of the main drivers of the plot. This is a Crapsack World (as TVTropes would put it) where there are some leeches have all the money and then there are the girls that train 24/7 to catch them. The rest of the population is composed mostly of what we could call human appliances -- footmen, waiting ladies, chauffeurs, liveried servants, and other poor bastards who figure in the book only to do some menial task and disappear.

So the daughters fall in love, then have their hearts dutifully broken, and we get to the ""all is lost"" moment, which is another highlight in the book. Here the fortunes of the Bennet family reach their absolute nadir: [/Spoiler](/s ""Lydia elopes with Wickham, and Bingley and Darcy are gone without hope of their ever coming back to marry the girls""). And then to top it off they get a 'neener neener' letter from that cretin Mr. Collins. Simply amazing. And then the payoff, and you get to feel your first love all over again.

Anybody else loved the book? Hated it? Had trouble keeping their ""the latter""s and ""the former""s straight? Bring it on.

I’m just having a hard time getting through a book where all the characters are so unlikeable and unrelatable. Or am I reading it wrong? Are any of the characters supposed to be likable? 

I’m just frustrated because I normally love older classics as many of them stand the test of time and stay relevant, but this one is really boring me to death.

So far I’ve read The Iliad and Pride and Prejudice,"Like a lot of people on here, I enjoyed reading as a kid but didn’t stick with it when high school got busy. I decided to start it up again as a freshman in college. It’s only a start but compared to my complete absence of reading last year, I’m happy. This subreddit continues to motivate and offer up new books to explore.

The Iliad

Wanted to read it because I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Odyssey in High School. I felt it fell short in comparison. A great read if you like war and are interested in Homer but I feel it’s themes were too narrow. The battle scenes were long and drawn on and the listing of regiments was particularly odd. Overall a great read but I expected more having loved The Odyssey.

Pride and Prejudice 

I decided to read this because I’m a sucker for romance movies and wanted to see if a book had the same effect. The novel exceeded my expectations and delved into interesting themes of classes and sisterhood. Thoroughly enjoyed this one.

nwqnkb,Finished Pride and Prejudice for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised!,"I have been finding myself more and more drawn to the classics, either as rereads from high school or reading them for the first time.  One night I told a cousin that I was working my way through the Netflix series Bridgerton and she asked if I'd ever read Pride and Prejudice.  I said that I hadn't, and I didn't have much interest.  Seemed like it'd be kind of stuffy and, quite honestly, a slog of a read.

But after she mentioned it I figured I'd give it a try.  It took me about a month to get through; at first I wasn't sure I'd get the hang of their use of language (I always HATED Shakespeare in school because I struggled to understand what the hell was happening), but after about 40 pages it fell into place and the book ended up being a pretty fun romp!  I was surprised by how witty it was, and I love their eloquent sarcasm.  I'm curious as to whether the language is accurate to the time period, but I'm guessing that it likely is.  

Overall I found the characters well portrayed, the dialogue well written and the plot engaging.  I'll admit that I did have confusion from time to time as to which Miss Bennett was specifically being referenced, but I picked it up pretty well from context.

I've identified some common themes already, but feel free to critique them. I think that both use romanticism to support ""feminist"" ideas. Both Ghosts and Pride and Prejudice have these underestimated, powerful female characters (Elizabeth in P&P, Regine in Ghosts).

I also think that the authors portray ""bad"" parents. Both texts show negative relationships between the parents and children. Whereas Pride and Prejudice portrays the relationship in a comedic form, Ghosts portrays it in a more sombre way.

He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.”

oupd01,"I really enjoyed Emma by Jane Austen, but I might DNF Pride and Prejudice - would love some advice","I'd like advice on whether I should continue based on my experience so far.

I enjoyed Emma a lot. The writing was great, and I love the imperfect characters and the troubles they spawn via their actions (i.e. Emma's meddling).

On to Pride and Prejudice; I am now at the point where, having heard that her sister Jane has caught a cold, Elizabeth has gone to see Jane at Mr Bingly's house. So I'm not that far in. And I'm feeling pretty neutral about the story. I have a long TBR list, so I tend to drop stories that don't grab my attention.

I think my problem is that Pride and Prejudice seems to have a faster pace than Emma. Pride and Prejudice has short and snappy chapters with a lot of characters needing to be introduced and summarised quickly, without much dwelling on what is happening, whereas Emma seemed to dwell more on the conversations and characterisations of a smaller cast. For example, I was a little thrown by being told, in quite short order, that Mr Darcy didn't think much of Lizzie then seemed to change his mind quite quickly.

My question is this: does Pride and Prejudice maintain this faster pace throughout? Or does it slow down a bit and dwell more on characters and their conversations and thoughts?

I understand that the satirical, feminist, non romantic style was uncommon and perhaps revolutionary for Jane Austen's era, but as I sit down to read this book, it all feels very surface level — the plot feels like a bunch of will-they-wont-they forever, and I can't get any deeper meaning beyond the fact that the entire text is kind of a joke.

What am I missing in Jane Austen's writing?

assxsc,Pride and Prejudice - whats so attractive about this book?,"I just finished reading Pride and Prejudice and I really enjoyed it.  Whenever I was taking a break, I felt strong desire to go back to reading. I really do wanted to be reading that book 24/7.  In a nutshell, I loved the book. 
But if someone asks what exactly I enjoyed, I wont be able to give in-depth answer.
I know that for my taste that period of time is a bit boring, nothing really important or shocking happens in the book, there are no plot twists, some serious problems described in the book are resolved very very easily, without any effort. An author could make many intriguing and devious plot twists but seemed like she missed every opportunity of it. The novel is dull, feelings described there are not much emotional, rather shallow. The book doesnt make you feel like crying or laughing or hating or intrigued, its just pleasant to read and thats all.
Long story short, Im confused. I love the book, I enjoyed every moment of reading it though Im struggling finding what made me so attached.

The way I see it, she is ultimately fulfilled by a man, with seemingly no ambition of her own.

iwrce7,"Just started reading Pride and Prejudice for the first time, and I want to walk through exactly what's making this so difficult to comprehend for me.","I'm not reading Pride and Prejudice for school or anything, I'm just reading it because pretty much everyone on the planet seems to love it, and it's making me feel pretty stupid. (That's aside from it convincing me, so far, that it's characters are all part of the race of space lizards secretly ruling the world. Who hell talks or thinks like this, even at the time it was written? And how it's already setting up to be an early example of ""not like other girls"" nonsense. Gonna ignore that for now, though.)

I don't know if this sub's quite the place, but I just want to go over an example of what's not clicking for me, reading comprehension-wise, to get some idea of exactly how stupid I am. This is probably going to be more confusing that what I'm reading, anyways, so... sorry for that.

So, chapter five. There's a couple of things here that confuse me already.

First of all, this sentence:
*""That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.""*

So far, as far as I know ""the assembly"" has referred to the group of people Mr. Bennett brought with him to the ball, but none of them are here, so it's referring to... the ball itself? But that can't be right, because the sentence makes no grammatical sense that way, who ""brought the former to Longbourne""? Is that referring to someone from an earlier sentence, actually? Lady Lucas? Even then, shouldn't it say ""**she** brought the former to Longbourne"" for it to make any sense?


Then there's then a long string of dialogue, seemingly between Charlotte and Elizabeth's mother (Mrs. Bennett), until this confusing mess:
*""“My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,” said Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?—poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable.""""*

Who? What? So Charlotte's actually talking to Elizabeth? Why would she then also be referring to Elizabeth as if she isn't there (""poor Eliza!"") And if she's been talking to Elizabeth this whole time, why was she called *Mrs.* Bennett which has been exclusive to her mother, especially when she isn't married? This conversation's lost me.

Two paragraphs later it seems like Jane refers to her own mother as ma'am. If that's actually who she's speaking to. Her mother also refers to her own husband as ""Mr Bennett"", so I suppose it wouldn't be too surprising for this bizarro family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iwrce7/just_started_reading_pride_and_prejudice_for_the/,2020-09-21T02:00:49Z,29,5,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST

a8mftc,A personal analysis of Pride and Prejudice (spoilers),"This book has been on my mind all week since finishing it.

After watching the BBC drama I’ve come to a few conclusions:

- Pride and Prejudice doesn’t represent any one character. It’s a mistake to assume that Darcy means Pride and Eliza means Prejudice. Both character exemplify both: Eliza, in her pride, never stops to consider that she could ever be wrong about someone. This pride fuels her prejudice against Darcy, who was an obstinate, stuck up, prideful jerk upon first meeting. But Darcy also has prejudice. As much as he thought it was right to keep Bingley from Jane because he felt the behavior beneath their station despite the sensible and wonderful decorum of the two eldest Bennet sisters. They can only unite when they both let go of their pride and prejudice and help each other grow in maturity. Darcy with his prejudice against her family and class, his prideful demeanor that considers him above others. Elizabeth with her acceptance that first impressions can be artificial with lack of information, and letting go of pride to let in emotional humility to truly try and know people.

- further, every character displays either pride of prejudice or an anemic lack thereof. Lydia is prideful to the point of stupidity, and brags about her horrific manner of getting a husband to her sisters. She also lacks prejudice, being ignorant of the ways the world. Jane lacks prejudice to the point of being too trusting and pure, where she trusts everyone at their word. This allows her to be prideful and hide her real emotions which makes Darcy think she’s indifferent to Bingley. The same can be said of Bingley who lacks pride and prejudice to the point where he lets Darcy tell him what to do. The father Bennet in his pride thinks his lack of hands on parenting is perfectly fine. Mrs. Bennet is nothing but pride and prejudice and in ways that aren’t deserved considering her complete lack of culture. Always judging someone, talking out loud at them with a complete disdain for common courtesy. Mary is all pride, and can’t admit she knows jack and shit about the world or intelligence despite how much her nose is in a book whose mouth lives in complete impertinence 24/7 despite having few lines. Wickham uses his prideful hate for Darcy to get back at him to make others prejudiced against Darcy. Then there’s Collins, De Bourgh, Miss Bingley. Pride, pride, pride. Prejudice, Prejudice, prejudice.  In some ways, pride their informs their prejudice.

- The book doesn’t say pride or prejudice are bad inherently. We need some prejudice if we aren’t to be abused by assholes like Wickham. And we need some level of pride so as to not fall into ruin like Lydia or engage in the poor decorum of Mrs. Bennet. Too little prejudice and we are to be taken advantage of like Jane or Bingley. Too much pride and we turn into De Bourgh.

- By managing a good balance of the two, both Elizabeth and Darcy are free to be happy.

I'm really familiar with the BBC Colin Firth version so it has been interesting to read it again in its base form.(It also occurred to me my first experience of this book was via the Wishbone PBS episode which completely omitted the Lydia arc). Within the context of the society and historical era there are some truly shocking moments. I'm going to spoil things, as if anyone who cares hasn't already seen or read it. 

I was really uncomfortable and embarrassed for Elizabeth by her mother during those early ball scenes. At times my mom has been embarrassing but never to that extent. Previously I enjoyed Mr. Bennett but this time around it's really clear that he is responsible for much of what goes wrong. 

Finally Mr. Darcy's proposal and Elizabeth's subsequent refusal is so very fierce and the entire time they both are struggling to maintain composure. It seemed that Mr. Darcy still wouldn't take Elizabeth's rebuke serious until she called out his ungentlemanlike manner. She goes on to thoroughly tear him down and state under no uncertain terms that she disliked him from the very beginning. I wonder if the force and vitriol of this scene is lost on many current readers due to difference in vernacular and manners.

I really enjoyed the dialogue between the two leads and I've never been so worked up over letters. Overall, I thought the love story was neatly done, with Elizabeth's gradual change in attitude realistically developed. 

Unfortunately, my overall first impression was that the novel sought to display an ideal romance/pairing and satirize or criticize a variety of behaviors. It seems like all the girls were ranked in their character and awarded their due via wealth of husband.

199ktax,Pride & Promethazine,"Pride & Prejudice is critically acclaimed and touted as an all time classic. While there's no denying that Jane Austen delivered an impeccable ability of expression that is fairly unmatched, I couldn't help but feel that I was being strung along to follow a narrative that was not quite worthy of the merit of my time investment.

Sure, the contrast between the genuine and the contrived, the constant personal misjudgments of character and corrections that follow, and with this of course the developments of the main characters, prominent among them are Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were indeed fascinating.. but for such a damn long book I might as well have read the spark notes.

I certainly praise Jane Austen on her verbose and superbly composed structure that never failed to deliver seamless dialogue which many readers will enjoy. Unfortunately, it was not enough to engage me in this long winded tale of pride and prejudice.

Most of all, I really felt for Elizabeth and her admiration of Darcy grew on me and as it did with her! 

Admittedly, I was pretty much expecting Darcy to be her lover by the end due to expecting Austen to pull a 'twist' on me like she did in Sense and Sensibility.

1nr5pw,"Just finished reading Pride and Prejudice for the first time, my first ""classic"" novel read, at 24.","I am ashamed to say that I haven't picked up this book earlier, and that it was really my fiancée's intimacy with the book (and the 2005 movie) that I ever picked it up to begin with.

Reading it over the course of three days, I found it to be surprisingly easier to digest than I assumed it would be, for a work set in the late 18th / early 19th century. 

The book has highlighted a few lessons to me, but even before that I have to say that *my* addiction to it is the dialogue, and how thoroughly and intimately Jane Austen was able to narrate Elizabeth's feelings throughout the entirety of the book's timeline.  I felt as though I was in her head, that I knew her inside and out, and that is a quality I don't believe I have seen so much in any other writer (mind you I'm a rather novice reader, as mentioned, this is my first 'classic' novel). 

Elizabeth is nothing if not headstrong. Both her ability to disregard the established order of social rank and her concurrent ability to focus solely on her feelings over all else is remarkable in such a time, where other women - and men - may have felt *persuaded* by their own hearts to do the same, was something few I imagine would have pursued the priority as bluntly as Elizabeth did, and that is something that anyone can take away from this book as a lesson, not just in matters of the heart, but in relation to almost anything in life. 

I quite loved this book, and I feel like, with many great books and movies, I'll want to read it again. I'm looking forward to it because there's a hunch in my mind that reading it a second time will bring about a wholly new angle of understanding of every paragraph, and that's like reading a whole new book in a very comfortable world, which is rewarding all of itself. 

Anyway! The whole purpose of this thread is to gush. Does anyone else have insight into what they ultimately took away from the book as lessons, why they liked it?

- I actually understood Darcy and his motives/why he acted the way he did a lot earlier in the book and even identified with him a bit. He seems very introverted and a bit socially awkward and that doesn't come across well in the movies. He is also a bit insecure about his lack of social prowess/charm compared to Wickham and mentions that a few times in the book

- I have always like Jane but as a character in this book, she tested my patience at times, especially when she totally shuts down the conversation when Lydia lets it slip that Darcy was at her wedding. 

- I never realized how closed off Elizabeth was to her family, and the ""shame"" she felt at their behaviour as the story proceeds.

- The book is personification of it's title. The theme comes across loud and clear in both Darcy and Elizabeth, especially in the first half of the book. I thought it was also interesting to see Lizzie have her crush on Wickham and fall so irrationally for him that she buys his lies without thinking. It is even more amusing to see her pride herself on her impartiality and rational thoughts. It's so very teenage, it reminds you that these girls are barely adults :) 

- I've never liked Wickham or Lydia and felt the same way about them in the books. Mary is always a bit of a wash.

- One thing I didn't like: after spending so much time on their courtship, I had expected more than one short chapter on the epilogue. They didn't even talk about the weddings or anything!

56hk2t,Loved 'Pride & Prejudice' more than 'Dune' / 'Hitchhiker's Guide' ...now I am troubled !,"Recently I thought to read 'a book a week'. It went like this

**Hitchhiker's Guide...** - **Dune** - **Pride and Prejudice** - **The Passage** - **Sense and Sensibility** - **Fahrenheit 451** will start today ;)

Generally I lean towards Fiction/ SciFi but somehow I really liked PnP much more than HG/Dune (SnS, Passage were so & so). 

I have  gone through almost all top posts/reviews here/there/everywhere & I agree with sentiments expressed that maybe HG was revolutionary at its time & HG/Dune key points may have been repeated so many times now that I might not find those ideas novel anymore.

What I am really troubled/curious about is that I don't know the reason I liked PnP, even though its central theme has been hacked to death in modern novels/movies.

**tl;dr** This ~~is~~ was just a rant ! Thanks

**Edit** In conclusion may be it all boils down to expectations. I started both Dune/HG which are enormously popular but because I was somewhat exposed to their key points though other novels I was disappointed. Whereas, I was not expecting P&P to be witty, charming & observant and hence it felt like a fresh air.

Edit: I need to write more in order to keep this post up. So here goes:


**Pride & Prejudice & Quarantine: A short essay on how the Regency novel will get us through COVID-19**

**Introduction**

Humanity's success in combating the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is all about **choice**. As we know, Jane Austen exemplifies the importance of choice throughout her novels, P&P being a prime example. How the gentle folk of Hertfordshire and the upper echelons of society decide on matters is all dictated by **game theory** (see *Suk-Young Chwe*, 2013).

**The Power of Choice**

So too can we apply game theory to our current situation.

The government's choice on how to communicate with its populace. The choice on implementing stay-at-home or shelter-in-place measures. The choice to let subject matter experts take the reigns. The choice to be transparent with citizens. The choice to collaborate internationally to ensure supply chains remain flowing across borders. 

There is also, almost more importantly,  individual choice. *Our* choice to listen to trusted governments. *Our* choice to stay or work from home. *Our* choice not to congregate in local parks.

*Our* choice to stay at home and dust off a classic from our shelves. *Our* choice to read **Pride & Prejudice** along with the wonderful Jennifer Ehle. While not an audiobook, per se, she brings life and levity to her rendition of the classic. The story of how important choice is remains as relevant today as it was in the 1800s.

**Conclusion**

For those of you who have read it and for those of you who have not: I hope you choose to stay at home as much as possible and fill your time with classics such as Pride & Prejudice.

Stay safe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fw088n/pride_prejudice_quarantine_edition_the_legendary/,2020-04-06T15:01:02Z,11,69,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST
jjn9i7,For the Pride & Prejudice fans out there,"If you also like musicals, watch the streaming Pride & Prejudice musical from Silicon Valley Theater Works. It’s free on Amazon Prime Video. I was lucky enough to watch it live, and now that I have found it online, I’m obsessed. 

The music is great and I am listening to the songs on repeat these days, but the reason I’m writing this in r/books instead of whatever subreddit covers musicals is twofold:

1. It is the best short form treatment of the source material I have ever seen. The dialog is almost entirely verbatim from the book, yet is cut together in such a way as to keep the essential components and most of the best quips while streamlining the whole thing. I love the A&E adaptation because it is so true to the book, but it requires hours. I’m amazed at what they were able to do so compactly here. 

2. It’s the first adaption I’ve seen that really caused me to take a second look at the characters and see them in a new light. Many of the songs are used as a window into the inner thoughts of the characters, and the result is incredibly powerful. P&P has been one of my favorite books for over 20 years, and I’m in shock that a musical would cause me to see something new in at least 4 of the main characters, but that’s what happened. And it’s the reason I felt I needed to say something here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jjn9i7/for_the_pride_prejudice_fans_out_there/,2020-10-28T12:59:59Z,16,78,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST
ml965k,My thoughts on Pride & Prejudice (Jane Austen),"So  starting Pride & Prejudice, it was a bit tough for me. I had to pile on while the family of the two oldest Bennet sisters made a fool of  themselves.

\- Their mother reminded me of Joffrey from Game of Thrones, a character that manages to anger me every time they speak.

\- Their younger sisters behaved, well, like annoying younger siblings, again fairly irritating.

\- The cousin is a fanatic and pompous prick

\-  The dad... Well, the dad is alright. Dad humour, and not really strict  on the kids. It took me a while to realize how sarcastic he was.

Eventually,  we have the love interest going on. Darcy is a rude but smart man  (apparently), Bingley looks alright, and then Wickham, poor Darcy 's  victim. Around 1/3 of the book I'm still not really invested in anything  that's happening. The women only care about going to balls and dancing  and meeting officers from the army, Lizzie rejects her idiotic cousin  and find Wickham interesting (but it turns out he's a gold digger),  Bingley runs off back to London, and nothing really interesting happens.

Around  what, 1/2 of the book, things get fun, Darcy is actually in love with Lizzie, Wickham is a lying asshole, Bingley does love Jane but got convinced by Darcy that he shouldn't, and things start turning around  (for me). At this point, I'm finally thinking, ""Ok, come on, Lizzie. Do stuff. You're the smart one, save the day!"". There is some random trip  after dilly-dallying for a while, random chance makes Darcy and Lizzie meet again, and the man's changed, he's nice and attentive! At this  point, I don't know if he is just being a prick, or if he really changed because of her.

The plot twist comes! Lydia runs of with Wickham. Again, there is a cultural barrier here, where the family's main concern is to get Lydia married, like,  that would probably not even exist in my list of concerns if I were part of that family, but ok, different times. Stuff happens, romance happens  (so different from modern age, like, people fall in love without ever  touching, it's a very alien concept for me). The rest of the book is fairly interesting and reads well, and I like the ending. I think the original title ""First Impressions"" would be better than the current one  (seems like it was a marketing ploy). 

Rated the book 4/5.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ml965k/my_thoughts_on_pride_prejudice_jane_austen/,2021-04-06T11:09:55Z,10,0,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST

I have trouble interpreting the old writing style and I feel like all I've been reading so far is a bunch of pointless conversations that I can barely understand and don't really develop the plot. I really want to love it, but I can't help but feel that there's something I'm missing.

lzylam,Is Pride or Prejudice objectively difficult to read?,"English is not my native language, but in my country reading, writing, and speaking English is the norm; legal documents and the law is written in English, though we are a Southeast Asian country.

rvz784,Need help in reading Pride & Prejudice,"This is my first time reading P&P, but I am facing quite a bit of difficulty understanding the text:

&#x200B;

1. I find that P&P is confusing to read. It's complex syntax causes me many garden-path sentences that require me to read, pause, go back and re-read to get the meaning. What's worse is that I fear that there may be instances where I think I get the meaning, but am actually completely incorrect.
2. Because of (1), I find the book tedious to read. When I do read, I hear music in the back of my head, and when I try to flush that out and focus, I get met with the tedious text. And thus creates a cycle. I have never had this experience with any other novel.
3. And all this is without even mentioning understanding the storyline and complex character interactions. Its one thing to not understand the narrative, its another to realize you aren't reading a book, you are reading individual words.

&#x200B;

I wrote this to ask:

1. How do I resolve these difficulties that I'm facing?
2. Did you have similar experiences reading this book through the first time.

&#x200B;

This coming school year I want to take a higher order humanities-focused programme. But for some damned reason ELit is compulsory, and P&P is a compulsory text in that subject, so if this is just a 'me' thing, please tell me frankly, so I may withdraw my application now. Otherwise, it will become one of the subjects which I will have to take in my university-application exams, and I don't want Elit to torpedo my future.

8j4wic,This is how reading Pride & Prejudice feels like when you are a fantasy/sci-fi/action fan,"The concept is fairly interesting, but the presentation is unbearably dull. There are a bunch of wealthy women aiming to get married and look around for proper husbands. And by proper they mean rich, polite, and handsome. Falling in love is literally those three traits and nothing else.

The whole plot is the characters going from one house to another, having dances and celebrations and little chats about books, none of which have the slightest ounce of tension. They don't do anything else, as if they have absolutely nothing to do all day besides wasting money and loafing around. It's nice to be rich with huge plantations full of poor people doing all the work, I guess. The closest thing you can call conflict is one of the girls being slightly annoyed with something another person did.

Although a lot of things happen they all feel unimportant, since they often mean nothing outside the message of how matchmaking is more than 3 variants. That's nice I guess, but there is no thrill in the way it plays out. I assume all books were like that at the era it was written, but I still found it impossible to care. The plot is basically a soap opera without a cliffhanger at the end of every chapter for motivating you to keep reading.

The characters were archetypes, often distinguished only by their name, the narration was often skipping over dialogues and events with rushed descriptions, nobody seemed to express emotions past slight discomfort, and there was absolutely nothing interesting going on in their society (war, riots, poverty) to make it interesting. It’s literally 19th century first world problems about ideal people in ideal romances having boring chats about love (and by that I mean money, manners, and ephemeral beauty).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8j4wic/this_is_how_reading_pride_prejudice_feels_like/,2018-05-13T16:20:28Z,41,0,books,Pride and Prejudice,POST

1dky43,Pride and Prejudice,"I have just read through Pride and Prejudice for my english class, and despite how much I wanted to like it, I just despised every aspect. I don't think Austen did a very good job of making the plot interesting enough. It seems to me that she introduced a few central themes in the beginning, and then stretched them over an entire novel without really changing them much- though this may be the fault of the characters. The characters (which I understand, some of them the reader is supposed to dislike) but I really loathe every single one, they are all so... Superficial. The premise of the story, I found, to be extremely sub- par and rather dull; maybe this is because I grew up in 1990's USA where everybody has an attention span of around 5 seconds. I just don't like it.

I do appreciate it as an influential work of literature, and see how it is so well known as that; I just really don't like it. Maybe someone can explain to me why it is so revered? It would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1dky43/pride_and_prejudice/,2013-05-02T22:34:52Z,19,4,literature,Pride and Prejudice,POST

1grcd3,Inconsistencies in Pride and Prejudice,"My edition of Pride and Prejudice contains two spellings of the word 'choose'. It initially started spelling it archaically as 'chuse', but about a third of the way in it is starting to spell it as 'choose', so I am very confused as to why it is doing this.

Also, perhaps even stranger is how they censored a county once. Just once. I know it's the norm in 19th Century novels to censor the county names to try and preserve its being a work of fiction (eg: _______shire), but in my edition it has done this only once, and every other time counties like 'Hertfordshire' and 'Derbyshire' have been mentioned by name.

I never noticed any of these things in Mansfield Park or Emma. So, is any of this intentional or is this just a sloppy publication?

ucplwz,Mr. Collins in Pride & Prejudice,"I just finished Pride & Prejudice. I loved how the characters jump off the page, and feel so real in my imagination. Three dimensional, human, flawed, but also endearing. I found Mr. Collins amusing and frustrating, and oddly relatable.

He is quick to cast aside anyone who does not play by the ""rules"" of society. A man of the church, that seems to come second to his worship of the social structure of England during these times. He's a yes man, embracing the status quo. Austen does not wholly condemn this way of life, there is romanticism but also ugliness. Mr. Collins seems to fully embrace the more vapid aspects of the culture. He endorses tradition with an ignorant detachment from any sense of morality or genuine virtue that other characters show a capacity for, such as Elizabeth and Darcy. His lack of subtly and composure make me sympathize for him because he simply does not seem to know any better.

I'm interested to know how others reacted to certain characters in Pride & Prejudice. Who did you relate to, and who did you detest?",https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/ucplwz/mr_collins_in_pride_prejudice/,2022-04-26T23:21:02Z,21,34,literature,Pride and Prejudice,POST

13w5136,Outlander: Did you read all the books?,"I just read Outlander, not realizing until halfway through that it is the first out of a series. I would love to talk about this book because I liked it enough to finish the first one, but will most likely not be continuing. 

First of all, there were parts of this book where I almost DNF, because I personally don't hold with how Jamie would be just an absolute sweetheart, but the goes and does two things:
 1) beat Claire, try to justify it, hold by the decision to do so, and then only promise not to again after Claire ""threatens"" him (which he clearly didn't take very seriously, though he did promise) 
2) All the scenes in which he sexually engages with her in any sort of forceful way, tells her she can't say no, etc. Since we're reading from Claire's point of view, we know that she's kinda okay with it, buy he doesn't know that and it left a bad taste in my mouth.
I decided to continue reading, because if I could just overlook those parts I actually really liked when Claire and Jamie interacted, and I thought the adventures they had throughout the book were interesting.

I finished the book and definitely had some bones to pick with it as mentioned above (also, the fact that all the gay characters were rapists, but I think this is something to be discussed separately, as there are nuances, in the sense that there were pleny of other people who were rapists also. Idk, it just felt icky to me), but was about to go borrow the second book from the library which is when I realized how feaking long the series is (nine books, not even including novellas and spin offs). I could not imagine going through all of that eight more times only to find that I wouldn't like the ending, so I looked up some spoilers.

I will not be continuing to read because I cannot believe after all that, [SPOILERS] Claire goes back to Frank and she and Jamie end up being separated for twenty years, Jamie doesn't meet his daughter until she's an adult, Jamie marries Laoghaire, has an illegitimate son, etc. I just absolutely cannot fathom reading about this stuff when I just spent 850 pages trying to get to a part with some vague resolution.

ncagur,"Outlander, read or skip it?","Crowdsourcing advice on reading the series. Normally I can gauge quite accurately from recs here and goodreads reviews if I’ll like something or not. But the outlander series has me at a loss. From what I’ve gathered 

Pro (for me): 
✅ multiple books
✅ historical and angsty 
✅ lot of fans and rave reviews 
✅ attention to historical details 

Con (for me) 
❌ Gratuitous (?) rape &amp; sexual violence against multiple characters 
❌ Adultery 
❌ author doesn’t always pull off the over the top plot 

I hate dropping books and especially series so would prefer to skip it entirely rather than being disappointed. So I’m asking for your opinion / advice on the topic

rma8mg,Very disappointed with Outlander#9 (spoilers hidden),"There is no doubt about  Diana Gabaldon's skills in wielding the English language to create vivid  scenes of domestic bliss... If only it had been contained in the first  200 pages as a delicious exposition of the life on the Ridge and a much  needed *retrouvaille* with the reader. Unfortunately, this book  feels very much like a ""successful author refuses editor's input"", and  bubbles to a cumbersome 900 pages, whose 3/4 are disjointed vignettes of  the quotidian life of Claire Fraser and her family.   
Too much of a good thing...  


Most  of the plot is propelled by William in short and disparate bursts,  sometimes frustrating for those who forget he is only a 21-year-old with  two brains and not enough blood to power both. (Even though I would  recommend reading [ what DG had to say](https://thelitforum.com/showthread.php?tid=8068) about>! his attraction to Amaranthus !<.)  


What could have been amazing plot & character development is brushed over (i.e., >!Fanny's disturbing behavior in ""Voulez vous coucher avec moi"" chapter!<, or >!Mrs Cunningham finding the Merck manual!<)  and instead we are given the same plot points, sometimes literally (all  the -long- lifted passages from previous books), sometimes reheated  (i.e., >!yet again someone reads a document from the future that states  when they might die!<, >!yet again Fergus is being pursued for being the son of a mysterious Frenchman!<... >!The Browns are now the Cunninghams' or  Ulysses!<... )  


Overall, this book is like watching a very slow game  of chess, but also all of its surroundings, and the shopping list of  each of the players, and how they cooked their breakfasts, and what they  had for dinner the day before, and how it was hunted, etc. Pieces are  moved slowly to arrive at a predictable (and most anticipated) reunion  only to cut short on the catharsis and bid you goodbye for another half a  decade (if not more).

Bonus points if the audio book is good as well, since I listen more often than I actually sit to read!

I've been a huge Outlander (Diana Gabaldon) fan for years and am looking to kill some time before the next book comes out. Can anyone recommend a similar series of books that I might like? Looking for a historical love story type series.. Time travel optional :)

rkfrvs,Readers of Outlander - Opinions Regarding Spanking Scene?,"So, I have only read the first Outlander book but I enjoyed it a great deal. However, the scene where Jamie physically disciplines Claire makes me very uncomfortable. I know that he's living in a very different time from ours, and I understand (though not necessarily agree with) why he feels like he has to do it, but the fact that he explicitly enjoys it -- enjoys inflicting pain and humiliation on Claire -- seems to align him more closely with Randall and his sadism than I would like.

Brianna went through the stones to reunite with Rodger bringing the kids with her and I am assuming she is in the same time as Rodger pre Jamie meeting Claire.

48pfce,"I hate to quit a book, but thinking of it with Outlander. Thoughts?","(Note to mods: Not sure if this counts as a recommendation request. Feel free to point me elsewhere).

Starting off, I think this book (Outlander, Diana Gabaldon) was framed completely wrong for me before I began. I'm a huge fan of epic fantasy and sci-fi, and have recently taken interest in historical fiction after falling in love with Downton Abbey and The Tudors (TV). I've never been into romance novels, one of the only book I can remember quitting halfway through in recent memory was The Notebook. I love romance movies and a good chick-flick, so not sure why reading doesn't do the same for me.

I mentioned to a few people I was looking for a new series to get into, and Outlander came highly recommended from a few sources. It was pitched to me as a ""time-travel historical fiction set in post WWII Britain and 18th century Scotland"". Sounds perfect! 


I'm now about halfway through and I'm not sure I can continue. To start, I hate Jamie. I've been rooting for Claire to make it back this whole time to reunite with Frank and have finally accepted the author wants me to root and swoon for Jamie. It doesn't help matters that Frank's character is very similar to my IRL fiance and I've never been attracted to muscular warrior-type men. Happy to read about them as characters, but to fall in love with? Nah. I almost rage-quit after he beat her and she forgave him literally one page later, but I kept reading for a bit out of a morbid curiosity to see how it would end up being justified.


That's all that's really driving me at this point - morbid curiosity. I feel so disappointed in this book because it sounded like it could be a cool epic-fantasy-historical craziness story but the real focus is on this damn romance I'm not even rooting for. Before giving up completely I was wondering if I took a few days to reframe it in my mind if it would be worth seeing out to the end. I already own the first three books (gifted from an aunt) so moving forward I would be committing to the series as a whole. 


Thoughts? Does the focus on romance ever take second place to the plot? Also what's so great about Jamie anyway that thousands of women everywhere idolize him?

The Notebook.  Fantastic actors and Nicholas Sparks just isn’t that great of a writer.  And how on earth did they pull off filming that rowboat scene with all the birds????  The same could also probably be said for another Sparks novel, Message in a Bottle.  The movie had Kevin Costner & Robin Wright Penn.

50 Shades.  I know, unpopular opinion.  But it was Fan Fiction that really needed a good editor.  The books give you waaaay too much insight into every little neurotic thing Anastasia Steele was thinking.  And Christian Grey was originally written like he was 45, not 28.

All I remember about the book is that at the beginning the FMC is at the airport trying to find a plane ticket, as her father died/is about to die in Italy. The MMC offers his in exchange for her notebook full of fashion sketches.

Once in Italy the MMC is revealed to be the FMC's stepmother's arrogant son. He owns a fashion company and wants to use the FMC's sketches but he will give back the sketches in exchange for kisses (I know , I know...) . They are business rivals but develop feelings quickly. So the plot is basically enemies-to-lovers with HEA.

EDIT #1: she was supposed to get married but her fiancé (that turned out to be gay) was cheating on her with multiple women. He then comes to Italy to ask her for forgiveness. But I don't remember how that goes though.

EDIT #2: The FMC's stepmother seems cold and bitchy at first, but she even stands up for the FMC later in the book.

iu035y,The Flatshare by Beth O'Leary,"Welcome to another installment of 🎉Drag🎉Your🎉Favorites🎉, the review series where we gaze deeply into the eyes of /r/romancebooks’s most popular titles.

This week we’re dragging *The Flatshare* by Beth O’Leary.  Here comes The Good, The Bad, and The Guest Post by /u/eros_bittersweet.

*^(Fine)* *^(Print: This is not an Official Thing. This way lie spoilers.  Proceed at your own risk.)*

**Overall impressions**:

***canquilt***:  This is an extra special edition of 🎉Drag🎉Your🎉Favorites🎉 because we have /u/eros_bittersweet sharing her analysis on The Flatshare, which she super loved.  We agreed to do a buddy read so long ago it feels like it was before the pandemic even started and I’m so glad we finally did it because without Eros getting me hyped up, I don’t think I would have enjoyed this book as much as I did.  As it is, my Eros-influenced opinion is positive.  The book was fine.  Nothing special.  But fine.  I mean, I read the whole thing, didn’t I?

***eros\_bittersweet***: Thanks for having me, u/Canquilt! I was worried I’d have nothing to say because of how much I loved this book, but, well, that fear proved to be unfounded. Canquilt and I continually messaged each other during our buddy-read to rave incoherently about how much we loved The Flatshare and to warn each other of upcoming emotional intensity. I ugly-cried at the book’s epilogue. Usually, my romance book tears are reserved for men dying in the Trojan war or feeding each other lemon pie.

## The Good

**“And There was Only One Bed, yet they communicated only via letter...”**

***eros\_bittersweet*** Our heroine Tiffy is trying to leave an extremely-super-bad relationship at the start of the novel. It’s the kind of “bad” where her ex is trying to financially prevent her from leaving his flat, yet he simultaneously brings over the woman he cheated on Tiffy with to sleep with her while Tiffy crashes on the couch, and then he kisses Tiffy on the lips on his way out the door.

Tiffy *knows* she has to escape Justin’s apartment and his control. So, she answers an ad for an affordable flatshare posted by a guy who works nights as a palliative care nurse.  This is the strapped-for-cash millennial version of “there was only one bed.” While not strictly realistic – most people I know who’ve done this have divided the flat into two private territories, bedroom and living room, and bought a futon to replace the couch – the trope is treated with slightly more realistic justification than usual, which is a thing I loved. Leon needs the extra income to pay for his unjustly-imprisoned brother’s legal fees. Tiffy can’t afford anything more private on her low-paying indie publishing salary. Tiffy will sleep on one side of the mattress in the nights, Leon on the other during the day, and they’ll swap out the sheets nightly.

Thus, two very different people begin to live their lives in parallel, inhabiting the same bedroom, kitchen and living spaces, but never quite coinciding. I know I like to handwave a lot of things with “it’s poetic logic, not strictly rational,” but this does seem intentional here. Tiffy and Leon’s lives overlap, but their experiences in the shared flat remain separated by agreed-upon hours of occupancy.  And so begins an entirely epistolary relationship - a trope I love in general, and it’s beautifully done here. Tiffy and Leon get to know each other not just by letter, but through other ephemeral indicators of their tastes and personalities. These consist of the books they each bring into the apartment (mostly Tiffy’s DIY books from her publishing firm, but there is Leon’s copy of *The Bell Jar* by his bedside table which he reads at a glacial pace); the quirky piles of tchotchkes, scarves and crinoline dresses Tiffy crowds into the corners of the rooms; and – plot-importantly – post-it-notes left on the cupboards for each other. These notes indicate things like leftovers intended for the other person, how much a book by a bricklayer-turned-designer left in the apartment was enjoyed by Leon (very much), and the comfort level of the beanbag chair Tiffy’s squeezed into the flat (very high). Thanks to Tiffy’s effusiveness – she tends to go on about herself in her messages, which eventually wins over taciturn Leon - they get to know each other quite intimately. While initially Leon thinks of Tiffy as “ridiculous Essex-woman,” eventually his feelings morph into affection, and she becomes, instead, “a strange, ridiculous, hilarious woman.” (65)

Eventually, this slow, gentle story of a relationship’s organic progression heats up. Leon and Tiffy do not meet until the halfway point of the novel. But in their roommate-note exchanges, we ride along as they get to know each other, falling for both of them along the way. We flinch with secondhand shame when what should have been a meet-cute turns legitimately embarrassing, Tiffy accidentally surprising Leon in the shower on a day she oversleeps and is late for work. This does not make sparks fly, but is realistically awkward, and they must make an effort to move past it.Their first date, arranged by post-it-note of course, is quietly companionable, while something else simmers just as quietly below the surface. The entire book is like this: quiet, gentle, tender-hearted, but the slow progress of love developing over time was a pure delight to read. I almost forgot this book’s love scenes were closed-door in retrospect, the feelings it conjured in me were so passionate.

**The portrayal of gaslighting**

***Canquilt***: O’Leary skillfully carries the reader alongside Tiffy as she makes the journey of recovering from the abuse she endured at the hands-- mouth, really-- of her ex, Justin.  Throughout the story, the narrative and my experience as a reader were congruent with Tiffy’s mindset.  In the beginning, Tiffy is unable to see or acknowledge the ways in which Justin was abusive and as a result I didn’t pick up on much of a problem with Justin beyond the fact that he had broken Tiffy’s heart, but it happens, right?  Indeed, I wouldn’t have even known he was supposed to be abusive if /u/eros_bittersweet hadn’t outpaced me in the buddy read.

But as the story continues on, Tiffy slowly comes to realize Justin’s abusive nature and O’Leary deftly changes the tone of the narrative as it relates to Justin.  His surprise appearances at her work events no longer inspire a sense of hope in Tiffy but a sense of dread.  She begins having visceral reactions to physical intimacy and starts to remember how Justin used sex as a tool for emotional manipulation.  And even though Tiffy is growing and healing, she (and us, the readers) begin to feel a consistent threat looming in the background, as unpredictable as Justin’s mood swings.

***eros\_bittersweet***: As a supplement to this section, I recommend u/Phoenix_Reborn_Again’s [wonderful essay on the portrayal of gaslighting in this book](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/guqtmr/a_journey_of_self/), and the conversation in the comments with u/CrashNebula73, both of which enticed me to pick up the book in the first place.

I’m someone who’s been in a not-quite Tiffy-and-Justin relationship. (And I had to wrestle with myself over whether my experience was legitimate to mention here because it wasn’t “as bad” as what Tiffy goes through, but the more I considered including it, the more I realized the extent to which I’ve minimized my own experiences in retrospect). I’d actually recommend it to people who’ve been gaslit and manipulated IRL if they are ok with reading about that trope in fiction. I’ve never seen gaslighting written with such sensitivity and realism.

It’s hard to explain how much a boyfriend like this wears at you, in small ways that seem too strange to complain about, while you think you are ungrateful for even questioning their sincerity.  A gaslighter often manipulates with these over-the-top gestures combined with nefarious attempts to persuade you that you don’t know yourself. My ex, like Tiffy’s, gave me enormous flower bouquets, paid for a lot of expensive shit, and made extravagant and highly detailed shared plans for the future, coercing me into going along with them. My ex, like Tiffy’s, held me to offhand promises of my availability, regardless of what extenuating circumstances I was experiencing on that particular day, and would be extremely upset if I had to bail, taking it personally and expecting me to make it up to him. My ex, like Tiffy’s, used  “teasing” to demean me, along with “observations” of how stupid and silly I was, which were presented as objective fact. Over time, a guy like this takes any perceived mistake or flaw and browbeats you with it as proof of what he thinks he knows about you. Over time, you start to internalize lies and exaggerations as truths you were too blind to realize, accepting that they must be true because they’re pointed out by the one who’s supposed to love you best. When we broke up, my ex, like Tiffy’s, made it clear how quickly he’d moved on, seeming to flaunt his new relationships in my face to try to hurt me and provoke me into a reaction.

The experience of being gaslit can produce subsequent amnesia, which precludes thinking about what you’ve been through. At first, you’re so subconsciously grateful to be free, realizing that you no longer have to manage your behaviour and words to avoid upsetting someone else, that you are almost too fine and well. You feel “lucky” to have experienced love like that and wonder if anyone will ever love you so passionately again. Meanwhile, your friends, who you’ve barely seen in months, are looking at you with relief across their coffee table (as Tiffy’s friends do in the early parts of the story) as though you’ve just escaped from a hostage situation. They say that they’re happy you’re free, that you’re back. And you think, well, jeez, they never really liked the guy you were with, and he never got along with them either, but isn’t that altogether a bit overdramatic?

Then you believe you’re fine and doing well for months or even years. And then bam, you finally have enough distance from the situation to start to think about your experiences more objectively, but suddenly your emotions don’t feel objective at all. Instead, you have this unbelievable rage and heart-pounding panic when you think of what you went through, of what he did to you. And that reaction seems so wildly disproportionate – after all, should you not be over it? It’s not like he beat you or anything. Should you really be so worked up about an ex being a little bit mean to you? It was months ago. Ages ago. And there you are ranting to your new partner about how fucked-up the previous guy was, thinking through the things he did to control you as though you never quite realized what he was doing before and now that you do, it’s almost too painful to contemplate. And it’s stealing away your present happiness, and making you doubt everything – whether you can ever trust yourself again if you were so mistaken before.

This kind of reaction happens repeatedly every time Tiffy tries to be intimate with Leon. Where I was pure rage of the sort I needed to purge in angry verbal rants and under a barbell in the gym, she is in full panic attack mode every time she and Leon try to be intimate with each other. She gets shaky and nervous and simply can’t continue; it feels wrong and strange and disorienting. And Leon is lovely about it. This is his particular skill-set: his patience and understanding. He is there for her to comfort her, doesn’t make demands of her, doesn’t pry into why this is happening, or take it as an affront to her desire for him. He is very angry at Justin, but he resists the urge to go full Neanderthal and punch the man’s face – he is too good for that by far. Instead, he simply wins the girl through his own merits: he finally tells Tiffy how he feels about her. By the conclusion of the novel, this quiet man is shouting in the streets about how much he likes her. Then he scales a drainpipe to reach their shared balcony where she stands waiting for him, in a delightful sendup of what we expect of grand gestures in romance novels, where it’s cheesy and a bit awkward and definitely funny, but also unabashedly romantic.

And it’s not Leon who personally heals Tiffy, either. She goes to therapy and begins to work through what happened on her own, now that she’s finally allowed herself to think about it. But when she is ready to be with him, he is delighted to be there for her, to care for her, but not in an infantilizing way – he is fully respectful of her personhood, even though she is struggling to regain proper ownership of her body and make sense of her past experiences. Leon is a very ordinary guy, except for this quality he has, which is exceptional and transforms an ordinary person into a romance book dreamboat.

**The Johnny White Romance Subplot**

***canquilt:*** Leon, being a hospice nurse, has the opportunity to build some long-term relationships with his patients and does so with a man named Mr. Prior.  Mr. Prior is unmarried, no family as far as we know, and confides in Leon that, in the trenches of WWII, he fell in love with another soldier-- a man named named Johnny White-- and together they “had one fraught, romantic war-torn summer” before being split up never to see each other again.  O’Leary weaves a storyline of Leon’s dogged pursuit of reuniting Mr. Prior with his love, visiting Johnny White after Johnny White, in an attempt to give Mr. Prior some closure before his very imminent death.

It’s an interesting subplot and raises the stakes for Leon as he comes to realize that his reticent nature and failure to communicate, and sometimes failure to act, has kept him closed off from an opportunity at love with Tiffy.

I enjoyed this aspect of the story but not in relation to Leon and Tiffy-- I wanted to read that bittersweet historical romance where Mr. Prior falls in love with a man in his unit, spending that one sparkling summer together, a frenzy of forbidden passion over a backdrop of war, before being permanently separated.  Kind of a 1940s Call My By Your Name.  Maybe even a 1940s Song of Achilles, only where Achilles gets shell-shock and is sent home instead of dying.  I’d read it.

***eros\_bittersweet:*** I see the “Leon and Mr. Prior” plot as part of this larger theme about timeliness that runs through the book. So I’m with Canquilt that I would have loved to read, like, The Notebook feat. Mr. Prior and Johnny White in the WWII trenches, but I think the plot had some other thematic work to do in relation to Leon’s character.

Leon is a man of delay and uncertainty, who has to be forced into any change of his life, who drags his feet on initiatives that’ll upset his routine. When we meet Leon, it’s subtly indicated that his current girlfriend Kay is an obviously bad match for him. When they break up, it seems overdue. Leon reflects that he’d fallen out of love with Kay long ago, but he could not bring himself to change his routine before he was forced to do so. However, with dying and recovering hospice patients all around him, Leon is constantly confronted by the finitude of time.  This is why he takes it upon himself to find this patient’s former lover in his spare hours, even though finding that Johnny White amongst all the others is a very difficult task. He scours the countryside to search out a dozen of them, interviewing each to find out if they’re The One.

Near the end of the novel, Mr. Prior’s lost lover has been found. He stands outside the room waiting to see his ex, a man he loved a lifetime ago. Mr. Prior is at death’s door. Johnny White was almost too late. Imagine waiting that long to act on one’s love, Leon marvels. But he doesn’t have to imagine it: he knows all-too-well what it is like to wait until the eleventh hour. “Left to my own devices, I’m the sort of man who’d never walk through those doors,” he thinks to himself. (284) Mr. Prior, after his reunion with his lover, indicates that Leon ought to tell Tiffy how he feels about her. “I left things too late, and how I wish I’d just said what I wanted when I still could. Think what my life could have been.” (246)

But there are no oversimplifications about unhesitatingly declaring one’s feelings, either, because boldness cannot always overcome the inherent difficulty of risking one’s heart. If that were the book’s thesis, Justin’s gestures – his demands to speak to Tiffy, the elaborate bouquets he sends her that are unasked-for, his marriage proposal to her, microphone in hand, in front of a crowd, when she’s technically at her job and they haven’t spoken in months – would win the day. But they don’t, because Justin is untimely in a different way. He’s missed his chance, used up every single one of Tiffy’s considerable good graces in his selfish manipulation, and finally driven her away. There’s untimeliness that comes from manipulation and cruelty, and untimeliness that comes from self-doubt and hesitation. And the book’s collision of character and circumstance is all about overcoming these obstacles to timeliness that prevent good people from earning their just rewards.

## The Bad

**The Leon POV chapters:**

***canquilt:*** This book is told from dual perspectives, which is not exactly my favorite.  Most writers don’t do a decent enough job distinguishing one voice from the other, but this isn’t a problem that O’Leary has.  My issue is that I hated the narrative voice of Leon.  I get that Leon is a man of few words, but his inner monologue is stilted and choppy.  His thoughts are jarringly incomplete, strangely lacking in personal pronouns and articles.  It’s as if we’re reading a stenographer’s shorthand.  Leon switches back and forth between this weird caveman talk and longer, more detailed reflections, and though it seems like there is a pattern there-- Leon tends to get more verbose as he gets deeper into thought-- overall, O’Leary’s style for Leon ends up missing the mark and Leon’s chapters are slightly uncomfortable to read.

***eros\_bittersweet:*** The Leon chapters are written with present-tense sentence fragments and no quotation marks. His manner of expressing himself is extremely laconic, nothing like the effusiveness of Tiffy’s inner monologue. I do love it when writers take risks, and I think O’Leary managed to convey the thought-life of a thoughtful, tender-hearted guy who is not great at expressing himself. But many readers found this POV and the style of his chapters a struggle. It also makes for difficulty in determining what Leon actually means at certain plot-important moments, as we will see ahead. *The sidekicks:*

***eros\_bittersweet:*** The novel includes many sidekicks and sideplots that could’ve slid into full-blown cliché but don’t. There’s a brown guy in jail and a dying man awaiting an eleventh-hour reunion with his lover,  both of which O’Leary manages to pull off. The only trope that made me groan slightly was the Littlest Cancer patient, Leon’s favourite charge at the hospice. She is preternaturally wise and snarky and just felt a bit too much like a cliché of every ill child ever depicted in a work of fiction, while adults bond over their compassion and love for One So Small, Yet So Brave. Still, she works as a plot device to get the leads interacting, demonstrates Leon’s affectionate side, and she’s more witty than cutesy.

***canquilt:*** We learn that Mo and Gerty, Tiffy’s friends since university, are doing a little flatshare of their own, which is strange for Tiffy because Mo and Gerty weren’t really friends with each other, so much as they were both friends of Tiffy.  Once Tiffy accepts the flatshare arrangement with Leon, Gerty goes so far as to ominously and repeatedly warn Tiffy that the first rule of flatsharing is to never sleep with your flatmate.  So, of course, Mo and Gerty are sleeping together.  But, why?  Their secret relationship adds nothing to the plot.  It doesn’t heighten any conflict or bring about any realizations for Tiffy.  It doesn’t add character dimension to anyone or more-than-marginally alter the dynamics between the friends.  No one changes or learns any lessons as a result of this subplot.  It is literally a meaningless detail that somehow has enough attention paid to it that I figured it out in the first third of the book.  If it’s not meaningless (see eros\_bittersweet below) it deserved more attention paid to it so that it could really show something to the readers about unexpected love, which is a continuous thread in this book.

Beyond the secret romance, Mo and Gerty have problems of their own.  Look.  I know side characters are side characters for a reason. They’re not the focus, but they do participate in the plot and help to drive the story forward. That’s how fiction works.  But these two side characters are barely characters in the first place.  Mo, a therapist, is only a voice that explains to Tiffy that Justin is harmful.  Gerty, a lawyer, fleshes out only in that she is able to help exonerate Leon’s wrongly-imprisoned brother.   I fully recognize that, to an extent, side characters exist to help readers understand protagonists and to add detail to those stories.  But these two characters, Mo especially, are cardboard cutouts with no dimension.  Who would Mo and Gerty be if a therapist or a lawyer weren’t needed (which, by the way, a therapist is needed and Tiffy has one, so Mo’s purpose as a character is even further questionable)?  Their sole role as characters is to resolve the conflict with Leon’s brother and to counteract Tiffy’s unreliable narration concerning Justin.  There’s nothing else there.  Maybe the aforementioned secret romance is O’Leary’s attempt to add some roundness to Mo and Gerty as actual people, but we lacked the details necessary to make either of them real.

I wanted Mo and Gerty to be fuller and stronger and more present on page, especially considering they were meant to play major roles in the resolution of our protagonists’ main conflicts.  Gerty felt a lot like a caricature-- grumpy and busy-- and while Mo maybe had more of a personality, his personality was “therapist.”  Katherine the weird crochet lady seemed, in some ways, more dynamic than both of these characters.  I understand that there’s limited space in a novel and every character can’t have this rich and varied presence, but O’Leary seemed to miss an opportunity with Tiffy’s friends as people rather than accessories.

***eros\_bittersweet:*** This is the one plot point on which we disagree just slightly. I definitely get what you mean when you say that Moe and Gerty don’t have much going on beyond their plot necessity, They are there to serve their roles as plot drivers for Tiffy’s awakening to her past abuse, and to tie up the Richie plotline. I agree that their falling-in-love did nothing for the plot, except to suggest that in some cases, the one rule of a flatshare is worth breaking. But, although Moe and Gerty are there from page 1 as Tiffy’s friends, they are initially presented almost as antagonists. They tell Tiffy she can’t live in theslum of a place she’s viewing with them before she checks out the Flatshare. They remark that Justin was extremely bad news in a way that upsets her and initially seems like an exaggeration. They are displeased when Tiffy actually goes ahead with this crazy flatshare idea, where she literally sleeps in a stranger’s bed.  But Moe’s and Gerty’s absolute necessity at plot-important moments is something magical - the coincidence of the right person for the right hour that elevates the everyday into something more.

Moe has bided his time for years while he and Gerty watched Tiffy suffer through a bad relationship with Justin. As a counselor, he knew that if he spoke too soon about what a jerk Justin was, he might alienate Tiffy forever. Tiffy, at the novel’s beginning, has mentioned a mere fragment of the shit Justin did to her, which prompts the following from Moe: “It’ll all sink in eventually, Tiff,” he says.  “When it does, you just get on the phone to me, OK?” (60) And Moe is there for her when that happens, this inevitable outpouring of rage and sorrow that prompts Tiffy to get professional help so she can finally deal with what she’s experienced rather than soldiering onwards.

Gerty, so grumpy and hard-nosed in a way that makes her slightly dislikable at first, contributes that ruthless tenacity towards Leon’s brother Richie’s criminal case. On the night of the robbery for which he was imprisoned, Richie had purchased beer from a convenience store which was robbed minutes after he visited. Although there are several obvious reasons Richie could not have committed this crime, his apathetic lawyer did nothing to effectively argue his case. He was, as the book says, a brown guy in a hoodie, simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Richie languishes in prison without much hope through the first half of the book until Tiffy mentions his dilemma to her lawyer friend Gerty. Gerty takes up Richie’s case and, with the right admixture of lawyerly aggression and hard work, gets his ruling overturned. And it’s pure coincidence that this occurs – a happy turn of events that leads to a reversal of fortune and changes the course of Richie’s entire life. It’s coincidence of the same sort that leads a desperate, down-on-her-luck woman to answer an ad for a flatshare that concludes with her finding the love of her life.

So as far as I’m concerned, the way this sideplot engages in the larger theme of character-driven timeliness was a recurrent thing I ended up enjoying quite a bit.

***canquilt:*** The quest to finally find Mr. Prior’s long lost love takes up a notable portion of Leon’s chapters  in the first half of the book.  His visits with each Johnny White aren’t detailed, but they do happen on page, and he has multiple conversations with Mr. Prior about the love affair and exchanges copious notes with Tiffy about the search itself.  Finding Johnny White the Sixth is a major plot point, as this is the first time that Tiffy and Leon purposefully spend face-to-face time with each other.  This Johnny White is a big personality-- bigger than Mo and Gerty combined, probably-- and the seaside visit ends up being a major experience for Tiffy and Leon and their rapidly burgeoning attraction and romance.  It’s a turning point in the novel and it seems that O’Leary would return to this dropped subplot at a later time, considering how much time she spent on it.  And she does.  The problem is that the actually very interesting Johnny White subplot is relegated to nothing but an afterthought until the final hour, when Leon needs to realize that he has to shit or get off the pot when it comes to his relationship with Tiffy.  Then, surprise!  Johnny White the Sixth magically appears at Mr. Prior’s door, just in time to tell Leon he regrets waiting until it was too late.  Eros\_bittersweet wrote about how the Johnny White subplot contributes to an overall theme of timeliness and even the finite nature of time itself-- further underscored by Richie’s stolen time slowly ticking away while he waits in prison for his appeal-- and how the story of lost love between these two men spurs Leon into a seize the day mentality (for others and only eventually for himself).   And I agree with her.  I just wanted a more graceful conclusion for something that was a very compelling subplot.  But I recognize that this is a nitpick.

## The Ugly

**Stop picking up grown women!**

***eros\_bittersweet:*** Perhaps my only gripe is that, in a crucial scene where Tiffy accidentally injures herself at the seaside, Leon picks her up and carries her for an improbable distance. Leon is described as tall and lanky. Tiffy is described as very tall for a woman, but proportional: “not particularly fat,” but not thin either. How is Leon carrying her with such ease if she is so close in size to him? Yes, Leon is a hospice nurse, so he must regularly move patients, but there’s a world of difference between hoisting someone into a bed or helping them to the toilet and bridal-carrying a full-grown woman, who weighs nearly as much as he does, a significant distance from seaside to hotel room bed. Honestly, I hate plots where women are carried because it seems so infantilizing and taps into heteronormative tropes, that the woman should be small and delicate and the man tall and hulking.

**WTF, Leon?**

***canquilt:*** This entire book is a journey of Tiffy relearning how to exist and love herself and love someone else after the damage inflicted on her by Justin’s insidious abuse.  Leon understands Tiffy’s struggle-- his own mother is an abuse survivor-- and he does a fantastic job handling Justin in the scenes where Justin shows up to try to regain control of Tiffy as she continues moving away from him.  In one such scene, Justin goes absolute apeshit at the flat door, banging and pounding and screaming and generally being a complete fucking psychopath in the hallway while Leon and the crew huddle inside the apartment, waiting for the cops and forming a barrier between Tiffy and her abuser.  After the fact, Leon inspects the damage Justin has done to the exterior of the apartment door and he reflects on how Tiffy might be feeling at this time, after this experience with Justin: “I wonder what it can possibly feel like, seeing that after everything she’s been through.  Knowing that she loved this man, and that he loved her, in his way.”

“... and that he loved her, in his way.”  That statement stuck in my craw. It felt a little bit like an attempt to soften the abuse Justin enacted on Tiffy.  And to have it come from Leon, someone who is supposed to have the outside perspective that Tiffy is only just now really starting to gain, felt wrong.  Justin didn’t love Tiffy and the behavior that he displayed throughout the novel wasn’t about his feelings for Tiffy, it was about his feelings ABOUT Tiffy.  He didn’t love Tiffy and he didn’t want to be with her.  He controlled her and he wanted to possess her.  That’s not a version of love.  It’s nothing like love and to compare it as such flies in the face of all the work that Tiffy has done in her recovery from this relationship.

***eros\_bittersweet:*** Here’s where Leon’s laconicness is kind of an issue. I inferred his sentiments on Justin’s violent outburst in a completely contrary manner, because the words here are vague, so I can’t say canquilt’s interpretation is wrong - it makes instinctive sense, although I read it differently. In my opinion this is Leon not caring about his door damage as much as he cares about Tiffy’s wellbeing, and wondering how she must feel, having expended her genuine love and affection on an asshole who turned violent when he didn’t get what he wanted. It seems like concern, not a rationale for Justin being a violin asshole. But this kind of indicates the whole problem with the Leon chapters, that one must conjecture one’s way through them.

***canquilt:***  And, of course Tiffy has red hair.

od77vg,The Notebook,"I got into reading months ago and hadn't read romantic novels at all, I also had some rough time before that and in general thought that such books won't grab me. But I got some Nicholas Sparks books and I had heard about The Notebook before, so I started reading it and I finished it in one breath. I'm frankly amazed by how good it was and how it keeps you wanting more with every page. The warmth and comfort Sparks creates in the atmosphere, the slow build up of the story, the travelling through time via that exact same Notebook all leave you appreciating and in awe of this novel. The reference to the Noah's ark, who saves the animals the same way Noah saves his wife from Alzheimer with his daily reading of their life story, the fact that their love is sacred and divine and defies even the toughest medical conditions makes the reader believe in true love and in the beauty of the world. It is really moving and touches your soul, especially in the last chapter where the hardships are at their best. I'd recommend the book to anyone whether or not you are a fan of that genre, because as it is mentioned in it, poetry's purpose is to touch the soul without being understood.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/od77vg/the_notebook/,2021-07-03T21:54:48Z,9,10,books,The Notebook,POST
18770n3,What book have you read that was actually WORSE than the movie?,"I LOVE Alfonso Cuarón’s sci-fi action movie Children of Men. I’ve watched maybe six times and every time, the ending always almost brings me to tears. So when I learned it was adapted from P.D. James’ book of the same name, it was a no-brainer deciding what my next book would be. 

After finishing the book, it wasn’t difficult to reach to the conclusion that I enjoyed the movie better. 

While James’ book gives a more in-depth look at how human infertility and humanity’s slow death march towards extinction affects the sexual dynamic between men and women and almost demented ways humans try to cope with a world without children or a race of dead men walking, I feel the book dedicates WAY too much time describing the failing of human civilization and the Regrets and guilt of Theo Faron. It’s not even until after 2/3 through the book where it feels like the plot and story are properly paced and stuff of consequence actually begin to happen. 

The film’s adaptation by, comparison, feels consistent in its pacing and the world building and woe-is-mes of Theo feel more compact a take up less of the audience’s time.

pl18pv,"Reading speed is not important, getting the ideas from the book is.","**In short: Improving your process so that you add what you learn from a book to what you already know is a far better use of your time than trying to learn how to finish a page more quickly.**

Of course you're thinking, ""Yeah, no shit, I know I'm reading to get to the ideas, I'm not looking at ink on dried pulp for its own sake"". But the amount of self-help literature and threads here on reddit that purport to be able to teach you to ""speed-read"" show how much interest people still have in acquiring this ability. To me, it's analogous to trying to become better at travelling to where you want to go by becoming a marathon runner. Perhaps you can actually become better at running long distances, but have you heard of this fancy new invention called the bicycle?

The bicycle of reading is Information Technology. Ancient Sumerians did not need courses to learn memory techniques; as soon as some priest started tallying bushels of wheat on a slab of wet clay, they enjoyed the ability to *flawlessly* recollect information across years and lifetimes, far beyond what is even possible for most humans working just with their minds. From clay to computers, that is what our technology does for us, recollection, there's no point focusing so much on improving the rate at which information enters your mind (assuming that is even possible to do to a dramatic extent) without you finding a way to use this ability.

Some people are going to prefer writing in paper notebooks, others will use digital bibliographic databases like Zotero. Either way is better than reading as fast as possible and trusting yourself to remember it all. Two years from now, you aren't going to care about whether it took three weeks or six to read a book, you're going to care about whether or not you recorded the basics of the main ideas of interest to you and where in the book you found them, in a place and format that is easy for you to access again. Do you want to be able to comprehensively recall a single book years after you read it, or do you want to look at the covers of two books and struggle to remember a single thing about either of them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pl18pv/reading_speed_is_not_important_getting_the_ideas/,2021-09-09T16:30:13Z,300,6189,books,The Notebook,POST

I’m not easily shocked by any means but it took me by surprise several places. I think it has to do with the very matter-of-factly prose. She doesn’t use a lot of description and detail - mirroring the lack of emotion of the two brothers - and this somehow makes it more raw and unforgiving when you read it.

I didn’t know anything about Agota Kristof before this. I’m now into “The Proof” carrying on the story from the first novel.

jx5qgy,Notebooks 1942-1951 by Albert Camus is truly a fascinating look into the mind of the young Camus.,"There is only one way to read this notebooks, from the end of his life to the beginning. From a deep melancholy that pervaded his life as he lost all his convictions to the hopefulness and belief in his works.

What do I say of Camus when I lack words, when reading his diaries is a transformative experience, where he lies there with the likes of Borges, Pessoa, Paz, Gao XingJiang and countless others who I forget in this overwhelming feeling I get while talking about him.

I always say that Camus was not a philosopher. He was an artist. He didn't have the rigour and his theories were flawed, yet he looked into the soul of humanity. He based his convictions in human life because he had seen the loss of it. He refused a Utopia that everyone believed in around him, if it meant him accepting death of his fellow beings. He saw the violence he was made of.

He put forward ideas with a lucidity that bordered at poetry. He made you question yourself before questioning the world. And despite all, he truly believed in giving hope to humanity, to not let us perish in the face of a rationality that was cold and sterile. I could never forgive Sartre for what happened just post the end of these notebooks, the deep melancholy that pervades in the following notebooks, yet I find immense beauty in the fact that history has redeemed Camus. I speak of him with immense affection, and I think that is what Camus makes you feel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jx5qgy/notebooks_19421951_by_albert_camus_is_truly_a/,2020-11-19T16:23:35Z,0,37,books,The Notebook,POST
yzcilv,What's the significance of this speech by Judge Holden in Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian?,"So I'm reading Cormac McCarthy's Blood Merdian at the moment. I'm at the part in the book where there's a lot of violence, and a couple of pages after this great quote and then speech by judge Holden:

""Whatever exists, he said. Whatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent. \[...\] The man who believes that the secrets of the world are forever hidden lives in mystery and fear. Superstition will drag him down. The rain will erode the deeds of his life. But that man who sets himself the task of singling out the thread of order from the tapestry will by the decision alone have taken charge of the world and it is only by such taking charge that he will effect a way to dictate the terms of his own fate.""

I'm doing a Ph.D. and at face value, I find the quote weirdly inspiring. There is this violent and unrelenting world and a way to make sense of it and a way to take charge of your own fate in it is just to find out more about it. However, what makes me uncertain is that the guy who says that (judge Holden) is not exactly the nice ""Carl Sagan""-type. Other posters here in this subreddit have described Holden as a  demigod, planted on earth to seed violence and death. Maybe this quote above is a criticism of science.  Just think about the atomic bomb: you try to make sense of the world by writing some stuff in your notebook, just like the judge does, and at the end of the day you evaporate thousands of people in an instant, something even the Glanton gang would find repulsive.

My new book is set at a remote farm on the northern California coast and is inspired by my love of Gothic novels. It’s a modern ghost story about eighteen-year-old Mila, who has just placed out of the foster system and is eager to be folded into the farm's large family. But on her first night there, she sees a ghost on the field, and soon, long-buried memories from her past start haunting her as well. Watch Over Me is about coming to terms with life we had before--the bad and the good parts--in order to accept and fully inhabit the lives that we have now. When I’m not writing you’ll often find me talking about writing on my podcast or with the students of the writing class I teach. My family (which includes my wife and our daughter) moved into a duplex with our friend (and fellow writer) in San Francisco, and it’s been a crazy time!

16qgp5u,"Which books are classics in your country/language, but not so well-known in the anglosphere?","I notice that when we talk about ""classics"", it's usually English-language literature like Jane Austen, James Joyce, etc. Maybe some translated Tolstoy every now and again.

So what is a classic from your own country, or written in your language, that blew you away but that an anglophone reader might be less likely to know? Doesn't have to be extremely obscure or without an English translation, just less well-known. And why do you recommend it?

I'll go first: ""The Sorrow of Belgium"" by Hugo Claus completely gripped me, I breezed through the 800 or so pages. Originally written in (Flemish) Dutch, Claus plays around with Flemish dialects and paints an utterly haunting portrait of a boy growing up in a family that collaborates with the nazis during the WW2 occupation of Belgium. The characters just jump right of the page; I'm not sure how well the dialect translates to English, but I recommend if you're up for that sort of thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16qgp5u/which_books_are_classics_in_your_countrylanguage/,2023-09-23T22:06:32Z,145,162,books,The Notebook,POST
v5zoh,I'm a 34-year-old man who recently read The Notebook. ,"THIS POST IS FULL OF SPOILERS FOR THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE. 

I watched the film adaptation of The Notebook less than a year ago. I really liked the love story, but there were things that bothered me so much that I was not able to love it. I decided to read the book to see if those elements that concerned me might be different. 

In the movie, I was not able to be happy for the couple's romantic and sexual moments because they were hurting another man, the woman's fiancé. The couple didn't do any better in the book. 

In the movie and the book, I was furious with the mother. In both cases, particularly the book, the couple let the mother off too easily. I would likely kick her out of my life. 

The movie made me feel the woman likely had sex with another man during the time she was away from her true love, which was a horrible thing to feel. In the book, I liked that the couple gave their virginity to each other and that the woman never took another lover, but going 14 years without sex felt unrealistic to me. 

Reading the book, I felt guilty because I did not feel hurt when I read that the man had other lovers. This is probably something within myself I should seriously examine. 

The book did way better in communicating the man's old age and the seriousness and effect of the woman's illness. The movie improved the story surrounding the house, developed the mother character more, and had a supremely better ending. The ending of the book was horrible.

What does everyone use? I’m torn between the “big 2” and was hoping to find some help here

Goodreads has a huge community and social aspect, it’s the main go to for anyone to start tracking their books BUT it’s an Amazon product which I loathe 

StoryGraph is presented as “the Amazon free alternative” but the platform is not responsive, the servers crash on a consistent pattern and I’ve read cases where it deletes books from your lists.

As a professional Amazon hater, I feel disappointed in leaning towards goodreads

People who tried multiple platforms, what’s your take? Has anyone circled back and ended back on goodreads after trying other sites?

khpum,This is why I love bookstores and the people that work there,"I walked into a lovely English-language bookstore today in the Parisian neighbourhood of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. I'm very new to Paris and my French is not great, so I still feel very anxious approaching people in stores, even English-language ones.

I spent some time exploring the store (which was awesome) and then asked at the front desk if they had Salman Rushdie's *Satanic Verses*.

The storekeeper looked at me very sternly and said, ""Mademoiselle, we do NOT carry subversive texts here.""

We stared at each other for a few seconds and then burst into laughter. He rang through my book and we had a nice chat about one of the store's most recent acquisitions, the complete notebooks of Antonio Gramsci.

cxcev,"Nicholas Sparks goes erotica: ""The Notebook (...Whose Pages Were Stuck Together)""","So...reading the recent Reddit about Mr Sparks' new interview – in which he implies his own writing's above McCarthy and Hemingway – was, for me, *one toke over the line*, as the kids say.  Thus an idea:  
  
Titles of books/movies/albums/etc. are not copyrighted.  Nor, obviously, are artists' names.  There's a gray area where if you use a title blatantly trying to steal fire from another copyrighted work, you can run into issues.  But – and correct me if I'm wrong, law-savvy redditors – I think this may not be the case when it comes to 'parody'.  
  
That in mind, the idea – a banning together of every pissed off lit-nerd on the Internet to create the book of this thread's title: one person legally changes his/her name to 'Nicholas Sparks' and acts as publishing editor of *The Notebook*, subtitled *...Whose Pages Were Stuck Together* (as in the cliché of a porno mag that's been hit with stray moneyshots) – a collaborative book of absurd stories exemplifying everything wrong with pop fiction, which Nicholas Sparks pretty well epitomizes.  
  
  
Some examples: the scene in *Notebook* where they row through the lake of swans; except here, Noah pauses to pull said swans onboard one-by-one, proceeding to violently sodomize them in front of Allie (""There's no deep-throat quite so good as a long-necked swan can deliver! hey-o..."").  And Allie's dad, rather than a rich oil tycoon or whatever, makes his fortune off an underground gay-vampire prostitution ring, and thus must keep Noah and his daughter apart – cuz once upon a time (in *profound* reference to *Paradise Lost*...) he allowed a shapeshifting snake-vamp named Voldemort to have its way with Allie on the promise of transcendence via Voldemort's secret Apple of Knowledge, which turned out to be just a weak hit of acid stuck to a Jolly Rancher...  This is a memory which haunts Dad, but which Allie was too young (or enjoyed too much...) to remember.  As she wasn't bitten – only sexually exploited – she's not a vampire herself, just a *carrier* of the disease, which means she has big golden flakes of glitter in place of nipples, and her period blood will inexplicably taste like A&W cream soda to he whoever is rogue enough to go down on her during ragtime – and Dad's not about to have his empire exposed by an impoverished-thus-standard'less Noah who goes sniffing around in the right places at the wrong time of the month, now *is* he....  
  
Et cetera.  Your turn, chums.  
  
  
PS: I think I'm at least half-kidding about actually getting someone to change his/her name and publish such a book.  But either way, should make a fun game.  And if some redditor's more ambitious about that idea than me, consider all ridiculousness herein public domain, and have at it.

1b00et1,"The Curious Case of The Turner Diaries or, When Is a Book Not a Book?","Some background: For years, I've been tracking the books I read on LibraryThing. Recently, I have also done the same on Goodreads. After seeing a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1azs00j/reading_controversial_books/) posted on this sub earlier today about reading controversial books, I started thinking of the notorious book The Turner Diaries, a novel filled with racism and glorifying violence against the government. The book has been known to inspire white nationalists,  most notably Timothy McVeigh, the man who bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. I realized that, when recently going over the lists of books I've read on the aforementioned sites, I hadn't seen The Turner Diaries on either one, so I decided to correct my oversight and add the book to my lists on both sites. That's when I ran into a problem.

On LibraryThing, I had trouble finding the book but eventually found it when I toggled from the default search from Amazon Books to Overcat, where I found the book listed. So, I was able to add the book to the list of books that I've read.

Then I went to Goodreads and entered the book title in the search tab, but the book could not be found. I did find a few discussions on Goodreads, such as [this one](https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/22473028-the-turner-diaries). It seems the book was once listed on the site, but its status was changed to ""not a book"" and is no longer searchable on the site itself. You can see the defunct page [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122748746-the-turner-diaries), but the page is no longer editable and you can no longer rate the book. Most questions about why its status was changed are met with a reference to the Book Records Guidelines, specifically the part about offensive content:

>We don’t include certain records in our database for books whose content we determine contains hate speech, promotes the abuse or sexual exploitation of children, contains pornography, glorifies rape or pedophilia, advocates terrorism, or other material we deem inappropriate or offensive.

While The Turner Diaries is an openly racist book, it's worth noting that Adolph Hitler's [Mein Kampf](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17971902) is allowed. And while the book did inspire Timothy McVeigh to bomb a federal building, the Stephen King novel Rage (written under the pen name Richard Bachman), which revolves around a school shooting, is believed to have inspired several real-life [school shooters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(King_novel)#Connections_to_actual_school_shootings), even being found in the locker of one of them, Michael Carneal, when his locker was searched after the incident. The Carneal case inspired King himself to request that the publisher allow the book to fall out of print. Still, it has an active Goodreads [page](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/66370).

Maybe it's just the thing in me that demands that things like my reading lists be complete, but the fact that a reading list on a site like Goodreads can never be complete because a book was deemed to not be a book is irksome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1b00et1/the_curious_case_of_the_turner_diaries_or_when_is/,2024-02-25T22:04:47Z,40,0,books,The Notebook,POST

A crystal-gazing, homeopathic self-help book ""The Secret"" scores 3.68.  

""The Da Vinci Code"" scores 3.85.

""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy..."" a critically acclaimed masterpiece rates 4.05 -- merely a fraction of a notch higher on the scale.

Romantic pap like ""The Notebook"" scores 4.10, while the achingly beautiful ""Under the Volcano"" rates 3.79.

pf8wtc,The Similarities between the Novels by Dan Brown,"I have completed reading all the books by Dan Brown. After the completion, it came to my mind that they are strikingly similar, even the non-Langdon ones. So let's discuss about the striking similarities (keep in mind that there are exceptions) ...

* Death - Someone dies; probably someone important/famous ( Ensei Tankado, Wailee Ming & Norah Mangor, Leonardo Vetra,  Jacques Saunière,  Bertrand Zobrist, Edmond Kirsch)
* The main character is called and is asked to go somewhere.
* The lady or the man (in the standalones) - is smart, confident, beautiful, bold and brave. (Sienna Brooks was the only 'the lady' who wasn't exactly with the good guys)
* The agency - The agency is used by the antagonist to do the bad works ( Delta force, 'Illuminati' Opus Dei, The Consortium, 'The Palmarian Church')
* Codes, Art, Riddles, 'History', 'Facts', Religion & Technology
* The story narration is mostly done in two places/paths . The ending involves the joining of these paths. (Idk if guys r understanding what I meant, Eng isn't my 1st lang)
* The one person whom you can blindly trust, that is .. until you realise that he/she is the antagonist. ( Commander Trevor Strathmore,  William Pickering, Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca, Sir Leigh Teabing, Sienna Brooks, Winston, the only exception maybe Mal'akh)
* The story has what I call 'Hey, we  are/were  related/in a relationship' moment in the end. ( Ensei Tankado-Tokugen Numataka , Pope-Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca, Sophie Neveu-Marie Chauvel Saint-Clair & Brother, Peter Solomon-Mal'akh, Bertrand Zobrist-Sienna Brooks, The King of Spain-  Bishop Antonio Valdespino )
* The intimate scene in the end. (It doesn't occur in the last three books)
* The character shows hatred to his/her parent. (Rachel Sexton-Senator Sexton, Pope-Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca, Peter Solomon-Mal'akh). This is one of the less prominent similarities.

From all this I have created a general summary-

The main character (A) is called and informed of a problem/situation . He/she gets help from someone of the other gender (B) . There are some riddles referring to arcane art or literature. The antagonist uses an agency to carry out the deeds. A gets help from a trusted person (X). There is a lot of riddle solving. A realises that X is the bad guy. X gets caught. A spends some quality time with B. It is revealed that one of prominent character is related to another prominent character.

I would love to hear your opinions on my observations. Personally I find that the books have been becoming worse since 'The Lost Symbol', and have generally lost their originality.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pf8wtc/the_similarities_between_the_novels_by_dan_brown/,2021-08-31T16:06:19Z,122,193,books,The Notebook,POST

I get it, I know that movies are short in comparison, but half the time it seems like the smaller plot points that build the characters are completely stripped away and leave me hollow inside, wondering how anyone who didn't read the book version could possibly appreciate what they've watched.

The Color Purple was a phenomenal book and I see why it was so acclaimed. I went in knowing it was about black women in the south, but had 0 clue what took place. I was enthralled and loved the story, front to back. Then I watch the film, and holy artistic license, it's a hot mess. To completely shrink the depth of Celie and Shug's relationship, and to strip Mary Agnes, Sofia, and NETTIE'S stories is atrocious. I'm just so inconvenienced. Every single character's story was wrong on some level, I could go on for days.

I do this every time, with every book-to-film thinking ""I won't get mad this time"", and I'm always wrong.

t8qzoe,Annotating books - the problem of reading library books,"I have quite recently realised that my method of reading has, till date, not been as deep as I needed it to be. I was shocked that I could not recall what I had read barely a few months ago. After a brief search online, I have learnt that annotating while reading is an effective way to remember what I have read. 

Unfortunately, this presupposes that I actually own the book. Because of financial constraints, I mostly borrow what I read and cannot have the luxury of annotating those books.

Are there any mobile apps that can be substitutes for annotating? Perhaps there are alternative methods to achieve similarly deeper levels of reading? 

I have considered writing down particularly phrases into a separate notebook as well and reflecting on them, but this method would be pretty tedious when it comes to longer passages. Also, I have considered using free online copies of books too but not all books have free online versions and I find it quite tiring for my eyes to be staring at a screen. 

I understand this may be a difficult issue to solve but hopefully this community of expert readers can help to resolve it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/t8qzoe/annotating_books_the_problem_of_reading_library/,2022-03-07T14:56:34Z,25,14,books,The Notebook,POST

I knew about cook & book (I live in walking distance of it), but thought it was a small business selling French books (I'm a native Dutch speaker living in Brussels), I only went there once to buy a notebook and it seemed like a very small store. Recently I've been actively trying to read more by buying more books at that aforementioned bookstore and I thought it was big. Today I was looking at a few videos talking about speed-reading and I found out how cook & book, the bookstore that I walked by so many times, is one of the biggest bookstores in the world with so much to offer.

ikm3f2,"Try to recall the last five books you've read, is there any common thread or just random choices?","I'm in a wonderful position where I get lots of downtime at work to read. I've kept a little notebook where I write down every book I've read since 2005. Some years have been more productive than others, the fewest being only three for the year with thirty six being the most.

Lately I've been trying to expand my horizons a bit and try different genres and authors. I've notified a trend where I'll follow a large book with a lighter read, maybe to mentally recuperate. Perusing through my recent reads I noticed it was pretty scattershot. They were as follows:

Knife of Dreams ( 11th book in the Wheel of Time series. FANTASY)

The Tower Treasure ( 1st Hardy Boys book. MYSTERY)

The Haunting of Hill House (HORROR)

Flight of the Eisenstein (Warhammer 40k novel. SCIENCE FICTION)

Showdown at Yellow Butte (My first Louis L'Amour book. WESTERN)


I love all sorts of different genre's and it's been great being exposed to so many diverse writing styles. From War and Peace to a Brother Cadfael mystery, World War II history to a Stephen King book, The Gormenghast books to Ray Bradbury and beyond it's like an adventure all its own.

It disrupts the whole flow of the story a bit, and usually about halfway through I get frustrated and stop doing that altogether and just read.

As for A Monster Calls... well, I was a crying mess by the time that book was done. Patrick Ness did a great job writing about a very sympathetic protagonist and the whole cancer thing was also really depressing, especially my mom is a cancer survivor herself recently.

xbxkr6,One of the absolute worst books I've ever read in my life,"This one makes my blood boil whenever I come across its gorgeous cover in bookstores, and that is *Rules of Civility* by Amor Towles. (Don't you just hate it when books you dislike have such beautiful cover designs?)

I cannot for the life of me figure out why such a tedious story (if you can even call it one) is a best-seller with high praise by both critics and GoodReads users. Absolutely *nothing* happens throughout the book, and the main character, Katey Konent, is utterly dull herself. Meanwhile, her friend, Evelyn, sounds like she has a 10x more interesting storyline going on, plus, more of what I was expecting from this novel!

Eve is the one >!physically scarred from the car accident!< at the start, who starts a romantic relationship with the man who was in the car with her and Kate, who gets to travel around (including going to Hollywood), gets mugged and arrested at one point, and eventually turns down a proposal after >!her boyfriend's been cheating on her!<.

Every time I think back on it, the more I wonder why on Earth was Eve not the protagonist instead!! I'm aware that she has her own spin-off novella, but I'm hesitant to pick it up, along with Amor Towles's other works. I would've quit the book 50% through, but the only reason I bothered finishing it was to catch up on my annual Reading Challenge.

h14tte,My theory of The New York Trilogy by Paul Auster (1986),"Are the three novels that compose this trilogy related? After bending characters and doing every kind of mind-gymnastics, I decided they were. My thirst for finding the real meaning of this book was such I spent quite some time looking for answers. And the answers ended up disappointing me. I found an interview with Paul Auster, in which he states that everything started with a wrong number: someone called Auster looking for a detective agency. Auster began *City of Glass* that way. Later, revising his old works, he found a play he had written, and decided to rewrite it, thus having *Ghosts*. Finally, he wrote *The Locked Room* and tried to tie everything and give a sense for the whole trilogy.

As I am writing this I begin understanding the point of the book. I wrote “I spent quite some time looking for answers”. So do every main character in his books. They are filled with questions, and they decide to do the detective work: investigate, investigate, investigate. They become obsessed with the object they are following. Obsession is also a major topic in this series. Everyone is so obsessed they end up losing track of reality, losing their significant others, losing their apartments, and so on. At the end, the answers they are looking for are the meaning of their lives. Everyone was living such meaningless lives without noticing it, and they get consumed by the search of meaning.

We know the protagonist of *The Locked Room* is the main character of the three books. He writes *City of Glass* and *Ghosts* while he is looking for Fanshawe. There are a couple recurring characters along the three books. Let’s start with Daniel Quinn, who is the main character in the first book, while in the third book he is only a minor character following Fanshawe. Peter Stillman is a big one too. He becomes obsessed looking for the language of God to the point of isolating his only son of any human contact in hopes he would develop said language. He tells Daniel Quinn “I’ll be able to die happily now, Peter”, and commits suicide the next day. In the third book, Peter Stillman is a French guy that beats the protagonist after he is convinced that Peter Stillman is Fanshawe. Another recurring character is Henry Dark, who in the first book is a creation by Peter Stillman to justify his bizarre ideas, while in the third book, it is a fake name Fanshawe uses to hide. The second book features characters whose names are colors. Peter Stillman Jr says “I am Peter Stillman. That is not my real name. My real name is Peter Rabbit. In the winter I am Mr. White, in the summer I am Mr. Green”. In *Ghosts*, Blue recalls a previous case, in which “Gray had been missing for over a year, and his wife was ready to give him up for dead. Blue searched through all the normal channels and came up empty. Then one day, as he was about to file his final report, he stumbled on Gray in a bar, not two blocks from where the wife was sitting, convinced he would never return. Gray’s name was now Green”. Although Green’s role in Ghosts seems trivial, his story is *The Locked Room*’s plot: Green would be Fanshawe, running away from his wife and assuming a new personality, Henry Dark in Fanshawe’s case. As for Mr. White, we know he is the one who assigned Blue the Black case.

The main character in *The Locked Room* becomes so obsessed with Fanshawe he included fragments of him in every character. Fanshawe is Peter Stillman running away and ending his life in suicide. Fanshawe is Henry Dark. Fanshawe is Gray running away and changing his name. Fanshawe is Black making Blue follow him.

Peter Stillman justifies Daniel Quinn’s existence. Thus, when he learns Stillman is dead, he disappears, leaving only his red notebook, which read “What will happen when there are no more pages in the red notebook?”

Black justifies Blue’s existence, and vice versa. “Because he needs me, says Black, still looking away. He needs my eyes looking at him. He needs me to prove he’s alive”, said Black as he pretended he was a PI, taking Blue’s role. Later on, Blue and Black meet again, Blue asks Black what does he need him for. “To remind me of what I was supposed to be doing. Every time I looked up, you were there, watching me, following me, always in sight, boring into me with your eyes. You were the whole world to me, Blue, and I turned you into my death, You’re the one thing that doesn’t change, the one thing that turns everything inside out”. After this, Blue does not care anymore if he lives or dies, for his life-purpose has already been fulfilled, he does not care about anything anymore, so he assaults Black, leaving him dead.

Finally, the author writes in the last book “The same holds for the two books that come before it \[this book\], *City of Glass* and *Ghosts*. These three stories are finally the same story, but each one represents a different stage in my awareness of what it is about. I don’t claim to have solved any problems. I am merely suggesting that a moment came when it no longer frightened me to look at what had happened”.

In conclusion, the three stories share the same plot of a person following another person, trying to solve a mystery. They get lost in their search, everything else becomes unimportant because they are in the search of meaning, and that is above all. Sadly, there is no meaning. Daniel Quinn cannot find the Stillmans anymore and disappears without a track. Blue reads the novel Black was writing “Black was right, he says to himself. I knew it all by heart”. What did he know? That there is no sense; thus, nothing matters anymore: “Where he goes after that is not important”. The protagonist of the third book gets Fanshawe’s red notebook, allegedly with all the answers he was looking for; nevertheless, he tore the pages from the notebook, because they made no sense, life made no sense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/h14tte/my_theory_of_the_new_york_trilogy_by_paul_auster/,2020-06-11T18:22:54Z,9,24,books,The Notebook,POST

ma551r,Perplexing Beauty Of The Arrangements Of Words,"I was staring at the pice-tag behind my book when I wondered; price-tags are a funny concept. Who gets to decide the value of something? If something is aesthetically pleasing like art, the ""amount"" of appeal the article has is subjective and one person can't be the judge of the price of the art. Therefore, we decide on a reasonable amount which would be agreed by a majority and finalize it. A blank notebook might not be worth too much but the moment you beautifully place words in it after a considerable time thinking about those words, it becomes more VALUABLE. It gains value. It goes from $4 to $14. Even more perplexing is the fact that you can put 80,000 words in a random order and they still won't be worth anything. The moment you arrange those 80,000 words into a novel they gain immense value. I think that's amazing. The power a pen has, to give meaning to an arrangement of words, to give it a price-tag, to make it valuable, is more magical than many of us would ever notice.

bkiecw,"How can I read this book? ""The Master & Margarita""","I got this fantastic book of Jordan Peterson's reading list, but I way overestimated my reading level. The book is called The Master & Margarita By Mikhail Bulgakov who wrote it around 1940 in Moscow. 

Now I'm dyslexic but in the last few years have grown to love books. I started listing to audible books, and have continued to read more every day. For Christmas, I asked for only books, real books not audible books. I do use some audible books and read them at the same time(try it sometime!). I also still listen to books, but my goal is to improve my overall reading comprehension. I also take notes in my notebook like a mad man!

So I start reading this book ""The Master & Margarita"" to my surprise I almost felt as if I couldn't understand 75% of the words. It's a dense read with lots of names and places that I don't have a frame of reference as I know very little about Moscow during the 1940s. 

I am looking for advice on learning to read/understand/pronounce half the stuff in this book. I also realize I may need to keep building reading skills before I jump into this book again.

y1cuh1,"The hidden transphobia in ""The Art of Being Normal""","*The Art of Being Normal* claims to be a book about the experience of transgender children, and the author worked in the Gender Identity Development Service with many people struggling with their gender identity. From the way that the novel is written, it seems like she has a baseline knowledge of transgender experiences, but it is clear that her knowledge is all second hand.

The book overall tells a good story, even from a representational perspective, but it contains many flawed ideas surrounding trans people and these can be harmful to those who don't already know that they are harmful. The two main characters are a trans guy called Leo and a trans girl called Kate, but both of these characters misgender one another and reference one another using transphobic language at several points. Kate comes out to Leo in the middle of the book, but he continues to deadname her and use he/him pronouns for her up until the very last chapter, even though at one point he says that ""I even start to feel a bit guilty about continuing to think of him as ""he"" at all."". Since Leo begins his transition before the start of the book, Kate always refers to him properly but it is clear that the character has a lot of internalized transphobia that doesn't serve the plot and was most likely a projection of the author's own hidden transphobia. That being said, her immediate reaction to him coming out is to say ""You're a girl?"" to which his reaction explains that ""I actually prefer the term ""natal female"""".

The entire book, whether intentionally or not, implies that trans people want to be their gender rather than already being it. Quite a common theme throughout the book is the idea that Leo isn't who people think he is because he is trans, and the fact that he's trans is used as a plot twist. Here's an extract of his first coming out scene, where he is hesitant to get to fourth base with his girlfriend, Alicia.

>""Alicia squeezes my hand as if to say go on, and I know I can't put it off any longer. Suddenly I feel dizzy, like if I opened my eyes Alicia's room would be spinning at a hundred miles per hour. I take a deep breath.  
>  
>""OK, the reason I've been acting so weird is because I'm not who you think I am.""  
>  
>I feel Alicia's grip on my hand slacken ever so slightly.  
>  
>I need to say it now, quickly, like ripping off a plaster, before I can change my mind.  
>  
>""I wasn't born Leo,"" I say, my voice growing quieter and quieter, so I'm almost whispering.  
>  
>Ella Fitzgerald has stopped singing. The room is silent.  
>  
>""I was born a girl.""  
>  
>I keep my eyes closed as Alicia's hand shoots from mine.""

The idea that trans people aren't who they say they are is incredibly transphobic, and this scene in particular places too much emphasis on *I used to be a girl* when most trans people wouldn't reference themselves like that. I, as a trans girl, would never say that I was *born a boy* as a way of coming out, because it implies that I wasn't always a girl, and if I don't actively come out as trans that doesn't mean that I'm pretending to be someone else. He was pretending to be a girl before he came out, just as Kate was pretending to be a boy. The whole book phrases moments where she is talking about being trans as though she is a boy who wants to be a girl, and not already a girl living in a masculine body.

Kate's private moments before she comes out would have been good if it wasn't painfully obvious that the book was written by a cis person. It contains the (almost) cliché of it being difficult to look in the mirror, which is a real problem for some trans people with major dysphoria but it feels shoehorned in. She does a weekly inspection of herself - things like hair length, foot size, penis size and similar masculinizing features - and writes it all down in a notebook that she... brings to school for some reason???? A lot of trans people will do these kinds of inspections, as it can be like an addiction, but it's not realistic for them to write it down and *bring the book into school.* It's clear that this element was only written in to be a part of her (well written but poorly worded) hate crime where she meets Leo. She also has a dress-up box (this is how it's referenced and presented in the book), which a lot of particularly transfeminine people may have but the way it's written, again, presents her as if she is pretending and wishing to be a girl but isn't actually.

There are many more points that I'm not going to get into right now, but I would love to talk with others who have read this book about it. As a trans girl with some shared experience with Kate, I loved the story but the representation of trans people was awful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y1cuh1/the_hidden_transphobia_in_the_art_of_being_normal/,2022-10-11T16:03:50Z,75,0,books,The Notebook,POST
bjdgw6,Books which should be preserved for the future generation.,"Hi,

I consider myself lucky to learn importance of book at the right age of 20s.(20s because this is the age where we build foundation of our lives).

Unfortunately I sometimes also consider myself unlucky that I never thought of reading in my teenage, because situation never came to make me realise reading books can be such a integral part of life.

My mother and my brother don't read books and same was with my late father. So basically I'm only one in my family who read books (fiction and nonfiction both).

One tradition which is followed by my mother (and I'm sure by many indian parents) is, she give me blank notebook and a pen on my every birthday and I'm sure on my next birthday too. Now I realise how useless it is. How can a child with no knowledge use that book and pen ? of course I used it mostly for doodling or doing rough works. But in my next birthday I'll ask her to give me a book instead of blank notebook with a pen.

And now coming back to the topic, just a thought crossed my mind while sitting in hot temperature of 45°C here today in India,

If there ever will be the end of world or situation where we have to leave the earth (may be funny, I know). 

I'll definitely take some important books with me so that it'll help me and most importantly the generation that'll come after me to get that knowledge and wisdom.

In such apocalyptic situation books will be only choice left as internet, movies,tv shows,anime, and anything else will not work.

Preserving literature works/books are not new, we can see books written 100+ years ago still available. Many old book 1st editions are sold at high price too.


**tl;dr:-**

My Opinion on book should be preserved for future generation:-

(I'm a new reader so actually don't hold many options but from the books I read)

The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz

This book tells you very well how our mind is closed inside a box (talk about orthodox). How we are living in a dream/pre-made rules/pre-made opinions which are affecting us in many ways. How to brake though those barriers and open your eyes to see the reality.

Agreements are:-

-Be impeccable with your word


-Don't take anything personally


-Don't make assumptions


-Always do your best

reading only agreements title will not be enough for you to agree to them, you'll need to read book.

So what books/literature works you think should be preserved or passed on to future generations.Which books hold such a great importance and knowledge ?

cseey5,Finished The Goldfinch. I'd like to know your thoughts. Spoilers.,"I had come home feeling sick, mentally and physically. And I wanted a big book to get lost in, something to keep my mind occupied from disruptive thoughts. So The Goldfinch, huge and yellow on my shelf, was my pick. 

I can't say I loved it. It didn't overwhelm me or keep me in thrall like I had expected it to. It was a little disappointing, considering its considerable acclaim. What I loved: the opening, the many passages about Theo's mother, his waiting for her, his ache. Hobie and Pippa. Every scene, every description, of the antique shop. 

My enjoyment dipped when it shifted to Vegas, where I didn't particularly take to Boris, and was happy again when we were back at the Barbour's, by Hobie's quiet and comforting presence.

I quite liked how Tartt finished the novel. Those few closing pages--though some might deem them unnecessarry, spelling out its themes and concerns--were written so well I went back and recorded them in my notebook. The final sentence, in particular, is stellar. 

I only wish this book had called to me like The Goldfinch had called to Theo: *Psst, you. Hey  kid. Yes you.*

I would like to know your thoughts about this book. The movie version looks good, and I am interested in watching it.

68yfux,"I finished a book. And yes, it blew me away: The Bridges of Madison County","**No plot spoilers. Only some minor dialogue to give a sense of the writing and character's emotions.**

I was in middle school when the movie came out and in elementary when the book was released, and I remember being aware of it being something of a Big Deal, at the time.

I can recall overhearing bits of red wine and scotch-loosened conversations with a lot of embarrassed laughter, blushing, and hands over faces, while the men in the other room grunted and watched football or talked business, depending on which side of the family I was with.

I knew it made adults feel and act weird.

Without ever having active designs on reading it, one day a short time ago, as I was sorting through 10 gaylords of free books, I came across a copy of it.

I placed it in the ""Oh, hell yeah!"" pile.

Short while later and here we are. Me trying to convince you to give it a read and you wondering what's so good about it to make me want to come here and tell you to, as if I know anything.

I'll try to keep this brief.

* This is the first book to make me cry. I have not read The Notebook, but the movie seems to be the only one where every guy is all, ""Yeah, I cried watching that shit. It was beautiful."" The Notebook has nothing on this.

* Writing style is just, I don't know. This one's probably personal, but his literary voice has an appeal like an Attenborough narration, for me; I fucking love it!

* The pacing in this is like a metronome strapped to the front of a freight train; steady and immense.

* The writing doesn't paint a picture for you; you paint it. The writing is Bob Ross walking you through painting a beautiful picture with the blade of a knife. 

Full disclosure - the story is also perhaps so captivating to me as the plot sounds all too familiar, minus the children, to me. It fucking hurts. I almost wonder if the characters thoughts in the novel are near-universal since the similarities are almost eerie.

Here's a few lines from it:

>His admiration was genuine, she could tell. She reveled in it, bathed in it, let it swirl over her and into the pores of her skin like soft oil from the hands of some deity somewhere who had deserted her years ago and had now returned.

>And in the catch of that moment, she fell in love with Robert Kincaid, Photographer-writer from Bellingham, Washington, who drove an old pickup truck named Harry.

.

>""I have one thing to say, one thing only; I'll never say it another time, to anyone, and I ask you to remember it: In a universe of ambiguity, this kind of certainty comes only once, and never again, no matter how many lifetimes you live.""

I know exactly what he means in that second quote, inside and out, backwards and forwards.

That line would not sound odd coming out of my mouth.

I know how she feels where you can pinpoint the moment you fell in love with them; when you stopped fighting it and accepted that your hearts would now be in sync for life, no matter how far apart you were.

podluc,"20 years later, I re-read ""The Bridges of Madison County"" and","For those of you unaware, this was a very successful, best seller book in the early 1990's and while any Amazon listing pretty much says what I'm about to say about the plot, I'll cover it just to make the mods happy. 

>! Set in the 1960's, it's a story of a married woman but lonely woman, who lives on a farm in Madison County, Iowa in the 1960s.  She's living the typical life of a farm wife and feels dead inside, taken for granted and yearns to feel alive again.  

>! She is alone on the farm while her husband and children have left for the county fair for a week with a steer they plan to enter.  A photographer stops by her farm after being unable to locate a few bridges he is trying to photograph. He asks for direction, which she provides and after some flirting later, they have a 4 day love affair.

The book came out in 1992 when I was in middle school and the movie came out in 1995 while I was in high school.  I originally read this book back in the late 1990's (like 1999) when I was in college, mainly on the advice of my girlfriend at the time.  As a guy, romance books were not my genre but I kept an open mind.  

Some non-spoiler views from 20 years ago verse today:

1) I thought the literary voice was awesome when I first read it and now 20 years later I still enjoyed his writing style and his tempo.  

2) My understanding of the book changed as I got older and became married myself. It also gave me a different perspective on the book. Before I just saw it as a romance novel.  Today I see it as a romantic adult fantasy. 

3) Today the book seems quite tame in the subject matter verse when it originally came out so I doubt it has the same punch as it did originally. When it came out, the target audience would have been around the age of the children whom discovered their mother's diary from the 1960's. 

4) There was some contention back when this novel came out, due to the ending of the book, regarding if it was based on a real person and events or it was purely fictional.

5) The dialog felt contrived and unrealistic.


Spoiler-filled summary of the book: 

>! The book starts out with the grown children of Francesca Johnson, just after her death, finding an old diary which recounted the affair between herself and Robert Kincaid, a free-roaming, globe-trotting  photographer.  She was an Italian immigrant who married an American (WWII war bride) and ended up in a small town in Iowa. She was college educated, taught in a local high school but felt isolated in her simple, mundane life, lacking intellectual engagement.  When Robert arrives asking for directions to various bridges, the roads are poorly marked and she has trouble explaining how to get to them so she rides along with him, showing him the way.  She spends all day with him as he takes photographs and tells her stories of his travels, it reawakens her yearning for a more worldly life. He told her he wasn't like other men, he was a free spirit, an artist, a poet, a vegetarian.  She succumbs to desires that have been dormant inside her for years. She and Robert realize the next day the have both fallen in love so they allow themselves to experience emotional and sexual passion, and end up falling even deeper in love.

>! Reality hits them both as at the end of the week, she went back to her family responsibilities to save her family the sandal and censor of the community, and he respects her enough to just leave he be. Years later after Robert has passed away he had his ashes scattered at a bridge that she had left a note at for him to join her for dinner (the bridge where they knew they fell in love) and she had requested her children cremate her remains and scatter them at the same bridge.  The children are confused as they wanted to bury their mother in at the family plot next to their father.  In the movie, they scatter her ashes at the bridge but the book ending doesn't mention if the children scattered her remains at the bridge or not.  

My Spoiler-filled review and critique:

>! As a young man in my 20's, this really plucked at my heart strings.  I read *The Notebook* right after *Bridges* and I thought Bridges was the better story while I liked the writing style of *The Notebook* more.

>! Fabulous sex, no slip-ups and they never see or talk to each other again, san a couple of letters sent over the years. They hardly knew each other, but they really loved each other. He loved her intellect, she his manliness. This fling was fated, it was out of their control, ""they'd been moving towards each other not just their entire lives, but for several lifetimes"". Top that.

>! As a young man, I though the worst feeling besides heartbreak was that feeling after an empty, meaningless one-night stand. Yeah, we guys can feel that too.   As a married man, I realize after reading this book that the 'one-night stand' that makes the rest of your life (multiple decades of it) dreary, empty and meaningless is much worse. That's what is heartbreaking about this book. That these two people had a really strong connection (I'll take issue with this later) and spent the rest of their lives pining for each other.  I think the author realized that too as he wrote a follow-up book (I haven't read it, just saw the wikipedia page about it) where Robert and Francesca have to deal with the loneliness of their lives after the affair.

>! Where the adult fantasy comes into play was where it took them one day to fall deeply in love. As a young 20-something, sure, I believed it was possible. As a 40 year old looking back, it's a nice fantasy but it is not reality.  They could have had lust for each other, as they both fulfilled something the other needed, they may had loved the idea they had of the other person but 4 days isn't enough time to really get to know someone and have a deep, meaningful connected love. True love takes the day-to-day living with the other person. It takes going through the ups and downs of daily life and facing life challenges together.  Insta-bake Love, that's the fantasy. You can't microwave love. (Look at you *The Bachelor* and *The Bachelorette*).  

>! A criticism I have about the author is that we also learn so little about Francesca or her life beyond a simple backstory. Sure, I get that this is a diary so she wouldn't be writing about herself deeply but this is also a novel and the author should be filling in this world, if even to mention things in passing, so we get a sense of her life.  Robert is fleshed out so you get a real sense of a professional photographer at work but nothing much about Francesca living on the farm.  They raised livestock as her two teenagers and husband had taken a steer to the county fair...so what other animals did this farm have? Were there smells of the farm wafting through the air?  Were their animal noises at night?  Did they have a garden (most farms do) she had to tend?  Who was doing the chores around the farm while the husband and teenagers were away? Did they have farmhands or neighbors helping while the rest of the family was away? Was there a farm dog or farm cat(s)?  Being one who has grown up in a farming state and community this was something that always bothered me. Also, the author made anyone from a rural area in America sound stupid simply because they didn't drink certain types of alcohol or read esoteric poetry.  

I think Bridges touched on the fantasy of a multitude of middle-aged women who feel trapped in mundane lives, taken for granted by their families. Women who fantasize of a manly stranger who would see their 'real' self, fall deeply in love with them instantly and offer them something more, that's why it was so popular back when it first came out. From the standpoint of a man, I enjoyed the fantasy of it but I feel I enjoyed it more as a young man than I did an older man.

55zuvw,"Louise Fitzhugh would have been 88 today. This is my love affair with ""Harriet the Spy"" (long)","This book really had a profound influence on my life.  

It was 1971, I was in middle school, and I spotted it sitting on a shelf in the school library.  It looked good, so I checked it out, took it home, and stayed up all night reading it.  When I was finished, I read it again.  I probably read it again a week later.  I loved it so much that I was tempted to try and copy it, long-hand, since I had no idea how to get a copy of my own (there weren't any bookstores in my town).  I think I actually wrote out the first two chapters before I gave up.  I can still recite the first paragraph from memory.  I can't tell you how many times I've read it, but it's a lot.

""Harriet the Spy"" opened up new horizons to me in so many ways.  I started to keep a journal. I got interested in writers and writing, thinkers and thinking. I started to observe the different ways in which people behave and think about their motivations. I started sketching. I got interested in New York city, Mata Hari, and Lewis Carroll.  These interests led to other interests and I truly believe that to a great extent, much of the person I am today, is due to the influences that this book had on me.  More on that later...


The next year, I was in the school library and spotted the sequel, ""The Long Secret"" sitting on top of a stack of books in the library office.  I couldn't believe it, and I couldn't wait to read it!   The librarian told me that it needed to be processed by the circulation department before it could be checked out, but she said that I could come in and read it if I promised not to take it out of the library and to return it to the office each day.  I felt so special, being the first person in my school to read it!


I have a memory, of me on a brisk fall day, sitting in a tree that I had climbed, writing in my notebook about events that had taken place that day.  I still have some of those notebooks, and I can tell you that's pretty embarrassing to read them :)


Fast forward 12 years.  I'm on the third or fourth date with a woman that I met through a mutual friend.  We're both avid readers and are discussing our favorite books.  I've never mentioned HtS to anyone in any book discussions before (or in any context really),  but for some reason I felt compelled to tell her that my all-time favorite book is ""Harriet the Spy"".  My date freezes, blinks at me, and I begin to worry that I have said something really stupid...guys don't read books like Harriet the Spy.  Finally she says, ""oh my God, I LOVE that book!  I've read it so many times!  I kept a journal and everything! I've never met anyone that has read it!""   That was the moment that I knew that I was going to marry her.


My future wife tried to surprise me at Christmas that year by writing to the publisher and asking if there was some way to get a signed copy from the author.  After a few weeks a note came back in the mail with a simple declaration ""We are sorry to inform you that Louise Fitzhugh is decease <sic>"".  We still have that note in our scrap book from our first year of dating.


Several years later I finally got to go to NYC on a business trip.  I had learned that the setting for Harriet the Spy was based on a real neighborhood in the Upper East side so I made it a point to take a stroll through the E. 85th Street area and visit Carl Schurz Park, the setting for some major events in the book.  I thought about Harriet, Sport, Janie, Ole Golly, and all the interesting characters in Harriet's route.  They were all so real to me, and I felt like their ghosts were all around.  I couldn't believe it...after all these years I was finally here.   It was as close to Louise Fitzhugh that I would ever get.  ""Thank you"", I said out loud, ""you changed my life"".

12h9eol,The Picture of Dorian Gray is my new favorite book.,"(Hello r/books! This is my first post here. I’ve always been a big reader, but up until now, this account has mostly been devoted to discussing and analyzing role-playing games. I thought I’d branch out a little and shamelessly gush about something I love!)

I first encountered this book when I was 13. We were visiting the library for English class. I didn’t really know what to read, and nothing grabbed my interest, so my English teacher did what she did on every trip to the library and picked out a book for me. It was the Picture of Dorian Gray. I read the first couple of chapters, and they were interesting enough, but the prose was a bit dense and I didn’t really understand what was going on. (I was a very stupid 13-year-old, don’t judge, ha, ha.) I picked up the story again when I was 20. I saw it mentioned here and there, and I remembered that I had read the beginning, so I thought to revisit it. As an adult, I had a much better grasp on the language and a much better understanding of life in general, which allowed me to actually “get” the book this time around.

And hot damn! What a book it was! The prose was beautiful; the exploration of vanity, shame, and influence was poignant and interesting; but I  think my favorite aspect was the layered characterization of and dynamics between the three leads: Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton, and Basil Hallward.

(Side note: I just love Oscar Wilde’s style. I’m currently reading some of his short stories and man… Something about the way this man writes inspires me to pick up a pen and write myself. I ordered books of his plays and poetry and am eagerly awaiting their arrival.)

At the beginning of the story, Dorian is young, naïve, and quite unaware of the effect he has on others. He quickly becomes fascinated by Harry and his “dangerous theories”. The latter’s musings on the impermanence of youth and the importance of living shamelessly have a profound impact on the former. As mentioned before, I’m the same age as Dorian. I’ve thought a lot about the stuff Harry talks about. I spent my adolescence in the closet, and I’ve often thought about all the time I’ve “wasted” and all the formative experiences I missed out on due to external bigotry or internal reservations. So I completely understand why Dorian would be so affected, especially if he’s repressed those thoughts and feelings.

Now, Harry is just the Victorian-era equivalent of an internet troll. It’s quite clear he doesn’t believe half of what he says and is just saying shit to say shit. Basil – and everyone, really – recognizes that he’s playing up the contrarianism to provoke a reaction and that his actions are not quite so bad as his words. Unfortunately, Dorian is extremely naïve and never got the memo, and thus unironically believes Harry is indulging his every impulse and living the hedonistic life of his dreams.

I love how Harry declares “All influence is immoral” before immediately and transparently trying to influence Dorian. He appeals to his vanity, flatters him excessively, and convinces him to suppress his conscience. Why? Why not? Harry doesn’t view this manipulation in moral terms. He finds Dorian interesting, and he views the exercise of influence as its own artform. It’s simply a way of fulfilling his own curiosity.

Basil Hallward is one of my favorite characters ever. I know it’s a meme to point at a character and go “he’s literally me fr fr”, but as a closeted queer artist, I see so much of myself in him. He refuses to display the titular portrait  because he put too much of himself in it. I have entire notebooks’ worth of writing that I cannot share for the same reason. Basil is not nearly as shameless as Harry and Dorian. In fact, he’s a deeply repressed and ashamed person. He’s terrified of Dorian discovering the true nature of his feelings towards him – a quite understandable response to living to an extremely homophobic society. He also to influence Dorian, but he’s not amoral about it at all; he wants Dorian to be good. He tells him not badmouth Sibyl, and he chastises him for his nonchalant reaction to her death. But he’s either unable to or unwilling to fully confront Dorian’s faults. With what Harry says about temptation brooding in the mind and poisoning the soul, I wonder if this unwillingness is a consequence of being so afraid to admit his love. Dorian successfully deflects from his own shame over the portrait by striking Basil’s nerve and getting him to confess, which support this reading.

Dorian’s vanity, Basil’s blind adoration, Harry’s existence: all these factors compound each other and result in Dorian turning into a terrible person. Dorian is haunted by his portrait. It allows him to live hedonistically and without serious consequences for his actions, but it also represents the shame he can’t suppress.

He is very eager to deflect blame. It was the portrait’s fault; it was Basil’s for painting it. It was the book Harry gave him; it was Harry for giving it to him. Ultimately, he’s too ashamed what he has done and who he has become to admit fault. He’d rather destroy the painting and be rid of his conscience entirely, but he can’t do that without destroying himself.

There’s this contrasting pair of scenes that I really like. In chapter 4, Dorian says that if he committed a crime, he would confess it to Harry. Harry insists that people like Dorian don’t commit crime. In chapter 19, Dorian all but confesses to murdering Basil, and Harry again insists that it would be uncharacteristic of Dorian. When Dorian is 20, he views Harry as this immeasurably wise person who understands him perfectly. But because Harry is a hypocrite who doesn’t do what he talks about doing, he doesn’t truly comprehend the depths of depravity a human can sink to. So the same “wisdom” that appealed to a young Dorian rings very foolish and hollow to a world-weary thirty-eight-year-old. It’s evident he doesn’t understand much at all, least of all Dorian.

The book doesn’t explain exactly what Dorian got up to: a lot of it is left ambiguous and subtextual. The reader witnesses enough of his initial descent to fill in the gaps themselves, perhaps with their own secret, shameful desires. I understand this writing decision, though I do wish we got to see a bit more. Maybe we could’ve seen Dorian influence some poor soul the way Harry did to him. But in terms of complaints, “this is great; I want more” is an excellent problem to have.

There’s just so much depth to the story, so much to think about and discuss. It has been living in my head rent-free ever since I finished it. I haven’t said everything I wanted to, but I am already embarrassed by the length of this post, so I will conclude things early, ha, ha. What do you think of “The Picture of Dorian Gray”? What aspects are your favorite, and what aspects left you wanting? Thank you for reading my very long post and have a great day!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12h9eol/the_picture_of_dorian_gray_is_my_new_favorite_book/,2023-04-10T06:19:34Z,15,111,books,The Notebook,POST
30lvjy,The Longest Ride: Another Nicholas Sparks Book?,"For the longest time, I was a huge fan of Nichols Spark' romance-filled novels. His first book I ever read was A Walk to Remember, followed by The Notebook. These books were so different to each other, yet evoked so much emotion, that I loved being able to read completely different things that evoked such similar and intense emotion. However, as I continued to read his book, I continued to like them, yet started to feel as if their plots were way to similar and started to get board. To be honest, I continued to read his books, because I like his plots, yet started wanting to read something different. After a few books, I had kind of given up on Nicholas Sparks, and gotten sued to his ideas that character's names would be different, locations would change, but ultimately all books I read would be the same. However, as I was sitting in the movies the other day, I saw a trailer for a new movie based on a book by Nicholas Spark. I had not read a book for a while, so I decided to read it before I watched the movie. I read the book and I LOVED it. I liked it so much, that I was done within two days. I am not sure who has read the book, so I don't want to give out too much information so I don't spoil it for people, but it is a different, adventurous story that oft me thinking about things no other Nicholas Spark did. I feel like with this book the author is showing an effort to go beyond his current 'comfort zone' and expand what he writes about. If anyone has read this book, and other Nicholas Spark books, it'd love to know your thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/30lvjy/the_longest_ride_another_nicholas_sparks_book/,2015-03-28T15:51:16Z,7,2,books,The Notebook,POST

wmi7ty,The best books ever written; a meta-analysis of the internet's lists.,"I think most of us here have come to the realisation that there are too many books, and too little time to read them all. This raises what I consider a bigger problem: If I can only read a finite number of books in my lifetime, how do I choose what books to read?

Personally, I have always wanted to read the books considered the best and most influential to literature and greater society. However, I was having difficulty finding a list that I considered an acceptable interpretation of this question. Several internet communities, media publications and academics have published their own version of what they consider either the ‘best’ or ‘most influential’ books, but many of these contained so much variety and potential for individual preference that I couldn’t take just one of them as my essential source. So, I decided to analyse and combine the data from approximately 20 of these lists.

The most robust resource I could find for this project was thegreatestbooks.org, a website that combines the data of 130 different lists. However, this algorithm contains rules that result in certain lists counting more than others, such as lists voted by authors and experts counting more than user-generated lists. Personally, I would have taken the opposite approach, however it nonetheless provided an excellent resource for a starting dataset.

My process was as follows; I created a list by taking the top 500 titles from thegreatestbooks algorithm and giving them all a “score” of 1 (meaning that they have been mentioned in a list once). I then chose approximately 20 other lists from a variety of sources, including Reddit, 4Chan, Time Magazine, The Reader’s Digest, and so on. Whenever a title that was already in the original 500 was mentioned again, it received another “point” and its score was raised by one. Furthermore, whenever a book that was not on the original 500 was listed, it was added and given a starting score of 1.

I repeated this process until I had a list of 1000 books, and then ranked these books based on how many times they were mentioned. Finally, I culled every book that only had a score of 1, meaning they had only made it onto a single list (including those listed in the original 500 and never listed again). This resulted in a final catalogue of 556 books.

A couple of things before the list. Firstly, I think it is important to note that some of the lists were not stated as the “best” books of all time, but rather the “most influential,"" and so on. I do not believe the rankings on this list to be indicative of a title being objectively “better” than any other book on this list but is more likely a representation of popularity and influence that specific book has had. This is at the end of the day just another list and it shouldn’t be considered anything more than a primitive piece of data-analysis.

The following is the top scoring 302, all with at least 3 mentions. Due to Reddit's character limit, the books with two mentions are listed in the comments.

3wpl40,Does The Godfather glorify the Mafia?,"First of all, I would like to say that people reading this should feel free to post their opinion of this discussion in the comments. However, keep in mind manners when posting or replying in the comments, this is a civil discussion. 

Second of all, let me clarify one thing in particular about the rules and my knowledge of the source material. As a rule, we are ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE GODFATHER, no other source material. We are not ranking Mafia literature and media as a whole. However, other source material is allowed if it is used in a COMPARITIVE SENSE (you are using the material to illustrate a point.) This material does not have to be a book. 

My knowledge about The Godfather is limited to the original source material, the novel by Mario Puzo. I have only watched the first movie. I prefer the book because it is my opinion that the source material is far superior than the movies in this case. (The movie was great though) However, it has been about 2 years since I last read the novel, and I have forgot a decent part of the book, so be forgiving about any factual errors. Just post information about the Book, although if the movie is the same thing, then feel free to post with that in mind as well. 

Now that that is over, let me explain my opinion. Alot of people call out the Godfather for glorifying the Mafia. The most popular reasoning behind this belief is that most people root for the Mafia in the novel. I don't believe that this is a valid point because who a person roots for is completely subjective, personal, and unwarranted. There is also inherent fallacy in this reasoning as well . There are 5 mafia families in New York. The Corleone family is the family that the book is based around. That does not make any of the other mafia families not important, and NO ONE roots for those mafia families. Instead, the mafia families are vilified, with the Corleone family only being painted as more moral at the BEGINNING. This means, in a mathematical sense, that the vast majority, 80% of the New York Mafia, is inherently evil. However, people can make the point that the Corleone family is appealing, and that is all what matters because they matter the most. This is a compelling reason, but it does not delve deeper into the novel. The Godfather does not just show corruption in the Mafia, it shows corruption in society as a whole. Showbuisness, the police, and the justice system are ALL CORRUPT CROOKS. And this obviously isn't in only New York, as seen in the gathering of all the Dons from other mafia's across the country. The Corleone family participates in this society, and has influence in all of the corrupt branches I have just listed. So, the Corleone family isn't as clean as people think, and we haven't even dealt with the majority of the novel. People may still say that even if the Corleone family isn't completely clean, they are still painted as the good guys. Well, this requires a analysis of what the Corleone family does at the beginning of the novel. The only illegal industries that the Corleone family deals with at the beginning of the book is Prostitution, and Gambling, both of which are legal in some part of the country. The Corleone family does not do this on such a large scale as ANY of the other families, and rejects the deal to distribute drugs from Solazzo. The only actual crimes that they do is intimidation, and assault, which happens mostly to OTHER CROOKS. So where is my point in this, you ask? The Corleone family is less of a MAFIA family at the beginning of the novel, and more of an actual business. They progress into illegitimacy later on. Now, the Godfather's most convincing point is the vilification of the traditional Don archetype. This person typically has a tyrannical attitude, and a god complex. Michael, the voice of reason, becomes this kind of person in the novel when he orders the execution of all enemy's of the Corleone family. In this way, he views himself as having control over who lives and who dies. This is what a true Mafia Don is all about, and what makes them despicable in the first place. The way that they pull strings alienates them from other humans. The original Don Corleone was famous for not doing this, and leaving this to divisions in his organization led by Tessio and Clemenza. However, the Corleone family becomes a ruthless, vicious organization during both Sonny and Michael's rule of the Mafia. For those who have seen the famous anime Death Note, two parallels can be made with Michael and Light Yagami, the protagonist of Death Note. Quickly, for those who do not know what Death Note is, I will write a two sentence description: Light Yagami is a incredibly intelligent Japanese boy who finds a empty notebook called the Death Note outside, dropped on purpose by a god of death called shingami. The ability of the notebook is to kill those who have their name written inside it's pages by a heart attack, and Light seeks to create a perfect world without crime by setting out on a moral crusade to kill all criminals, while running away from the police. Michael and Light are both similar in the fact that both have a god complex, and die alone. The significance of both characters dying alone is the symbolism that is drawn with their personalities. They pay the price of their brashness and arrogance by loosing all support, sending a message about the lack of morality in their actions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3wpl40/does_the_godfather_glorify_the_mafia/,2015-12-13T23:31:24Z,6,2,books,The Notebook,POST
i8adyd,The Philosophy of Michel Djerzinski in The Elementary Particles by Michel Houellebecq,"Michel, the emotionally detached molecular biologist, appeared to have a philosophy derivative of his academic discipline: the world was largely determined by underlying forces that, when isolated and properly identified, could accurately describe the development of an individual’s life. His brother, Bruno, and himself were, at first glance, polar opposite forces in modern society—the former was a shameless hedonist, the latter asexual and seemingly indifferent to the world. They were, however, the sum of unique incidents that accurately determined their lives, similar to the way in which a the future state of a particle could be determined by a previous measurement. This case of hard determinism precludes any possibility of free will and discourages a philosophy not rooted in materialism, though Michel does criticize his colleagues for lacking creativity when it came to scientific possibilities.

In his confrontation with the world, Michel came to be disillusioned by life in the second metaphysical mutation. Life had become “atomized,” a reality in which every individual separated themselves from the whole (including the possibility of human compassion, love) and engaged in self-serving activities. This produced a sense of existential disorientation, and a large sect of society sought spiritual rejuvenation in the contemporary New Age movement. The novel illustrates that this cultural phenomenon not only fell short of its intentions but arguably exacerbated the social malaise that persisted into the ‘90s. 

Houellebecq positions Michel as the force whose ideas eventually usher in the third metaphysical mutation. This is where I come into trouble, and I’m hoping that someone who’s more familiar with the philosophers/doctrines mentioned in the book could help me. In the last chapter of the book, Michel is talking with his colleague, Walcott, who describes the development of Michel’s work and philosophy as “mystical.” Walcott concedes that positivism could result in a new humanism. There are experiences exclusively possessed and shared by humans as a species. This uniquely human world—perceptions, emotions, etc.—separates us from the material world, and isn’t dependent on an underlying reality. Soon after Michel becomes engrossed with the Book of Kells. A product of 7th century Irish monks, the manuscript describes the world as intimately interwoven. The following page provides direct quotations from Michel’s notebooks. The individual, Michel writes, lives within a human space that is ultimately of humanity’s own creation: “In this space of which they are so afraid, human beings learn how to live and die; in their mental space, separation, distance and suffering are born. There is little to add to this: the lover hears his beloved’s voice over mountains and oceans; over mountains and oceans a mother hears the cry of her child. Love binds, and it binds forever. Good binds, while evil evil unravels. Separation is another word for evil; it is also another word for deceit. All that exists is a magnificent interweaving, vast and reciprocal.” Is Michel arguing that human beings artificially create space between others by recognizing the particulars of the world? In other words, does the recognition of the individual make participation in the aforementioned mystical “human world” more difficult? Or is he saying that human beings do not live in a vacuum, and that their “destinies” depend on the actions of other people; that by separating the individual, one would be deceiving themselves of the interconnectedness of the world and the necessary communion of human entities? It seems that the absent love and compassion Michel implicitly wants is predicated on the interwoven nature of humanity. 

Thanks for any help!

Also: I’m not familiar with Auguste Comte’s work beyond a quick Google search and Wikipedia skim. Neither am I familiar with quantum physics or the theories of the physicists routinely referenced in the book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/i8adyd/the_philosophy_of_michel_djerzinski_in_the/,2020-08-12T09:01:13Z,1,6,books,The Notebook,POST
gvf6b3,"The Web and the Rock - or, Your Favourite 'Bad' Book","Someone else made a post about brilliant books which weren't massively well known and by the time I'd finished putting down my thoughts on this book it was an hour later and the original post had been removed! I figured I'd post it anyway cause I'm all jazzed up now about one of my favourite books. 

I found a battered copy of The Web and the Rock by Thomas Wolfe in a 'free books' bin years ago when I was in Uni. I think it belonged to one of the lecturers and had clearly been at the back of some dusty cupboard (the previous owner had used an accountants business card with 1976-77 tax allowances on it as a bookmark) For a long time I was sure I had the only copy as I never met anyone else who had read it or even heard about it and it was never in any bookshops. Its still one of the only books I have reread multiple times. The only issue with it is that it's, er, not very good.

Wolfe was a prolific writer in the sense that he would lock himself in his study for days and nights at a time filling notebooks and then emerge to eat and drink for almost as long as he spent writing. The introduction to my copy makes him sound like less of a man and more of a force of nature. 

The book itself is about 700 pages long but the 'manuscript' his editor received after wolfe's suicide was apparently closer to 5000 pages. The finished article is massively flawed. Characters are introduced, given whole chapters of description, and then never heard from again. Throwaway scenes of no consequence drag on for pages and pages, battering you over the head with descriptions and digressions then just abruptly moving on once Wolfe realises he doesn't know how to move to the next scene. One character has an affair with a married woman but Wolfe forgets to add in the bit where they become lovers, so when they pop up in the next chapter living with each other you end up frantically looking to see if you've got pages missing. It's wordy, frequently bafflingly inconsistent, at times maddeningly frustrating, and should by all accounts be utterly unreadable.

Instead I find it to be one of the most engrossing, satisfying books I've ever read. One of my major complaints about some novels is that events occur and interactions can happen in a very mechanical way. The characters express emotions and encounter difficulties but you can never quite shake the feeling that someone is sitting just off to the side silently mouthing the dialogue to the characters in case they forget. I get annoyed at arguments and conversations between best friends or bitter enemies in films because you just wouldn't talk like that. No-one has a perfectly concise, humiliating response to an insult. Usually you turn bright red in the face, mangle your words as your brain goes faster than your mouth. That's what this book feels like. It's not a novel that was crafted and planed down and tightened up until every word and full stop is doing something useful. It's a hulking, swearing, staggering shambles but it's got such a soul about it that you not only forgive its limitations but you end up enjoying them. The descriptions, long as they are, are visceral and heartfelt and absorbing. Each new character is a fully formed being with a heart and impulses and desires. Their brief appearances are reflections of real life - you can be best friends with a person and then one day they're just not a part of your life anymore. This book wasn't crafted - it was hewn, dragged onto the page and roughly beaten into a recognisable shape. It's a bit of a cliche but you don't read this book - it's unreadable. You treat it like a magic eye, unfocus and just let the prose wash over you. I absolutely adore it and I wish I had found it sooner in my life.

There is a copy of The Web and the Rock on Kindle now for 99p and I assure you that even if you end up hating the book it's worth that much just to experience the kind of stuff I'm talking about.

In the spirit of discussion (I promise I'm not some publishing wonk trying to bump some numbers on a long-dead relatively obscure author) I'd love to hear some experiences with books which are objectively and demonstrably limited (I hesitate to use the word 'bad') but which you can't help loving.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gvf6b3/the_web_and_the_rock_or_your_favourite_bad_book/,2020-06-02T20:31:46Z,3,4,books,The Notebook,POST
envlvh,A semi-serious critique of Worm’s (the web series) first part (Gestation),"A one and a half million word web novel that is about super humans and is constantly hyped up as a better version of My Hero Academia. With such a size it has to be very good and full of action and suspense and… 

It takes place in a high school and it’s about a teenager getting bullied. Exactly like Deku. Is that how authors think they can make you feel sympathy for a character you know nothing about nowadays? By immediately victimizing her and demonizing her opponents? Is this what counts as good storytelling in modern times?

And check out these similarities. A teenager, who gets bullied in high school, by her best friend, keeps a notebook, that got ruined by the bullying, and has been making her own costume, and wants to be a superhero. It really is a gender swapped novelization of MHA. 

So she makes a hero costume and goes on a stakeout because she wants to try out how good she is as a superhero, I guess, where we get another similarity with MHA. She bumps onto the plot right away. What the hell; you went on your first patrol and you already found your first criminals? This is not natural, especially when she states there are dozens of other superheroes in the same city and most criminal activity happens in specific areas. When it’s so limiting, criminals should be hiding at a place where only elite heroes can find them. Not rookies on their first try. It’s not natural.

And then she overhears them wanting to murder children. How edgy is that? Again, we know nothing about these villains and the first thing the author does to give them characterization is to make them child killers. Don’t tell me that it isn’t trash tier writing, when the author want you to cheer for the hero because the only thing you know about her is that she is bullied, and boo the villains because the only thing you know about them is that they murder children.

And I know that some of you will think it’s not bad if it’s effective. Good guys are good and bad guys are bad, so if they are acting as they are supposed to, what’s the problem? Oh, I don’t know, what do you get when you have a victimized self insert and villains who are pure evil? You get justice porn as you see right here. Now she has all the justification she wants for hurting these people and get pleasure out of it. By extension the reader will also get pleasure out of it. She deserves it because she’s victimized and they are horrible people. Hurt them girl, hurt them really bad.  

And I have to question the power scaling at this point. The leader of a local street gang has the ability to heal very fast, get as powerful as he wants with no limit to his power, and on top of that he can fire blast and fly. How the fart is he only a street thug? This is final boss material. And if you thought this was too much, his vice captain can teleport anywhere he wants, and create copies of himself. And these are supposed to be street thugs. 

So how the hell does she defeat such epic level enemies? She doesn’t. A bunch of other superhumans appear and finish the fight in an anticlimactic way. They claim they wanted to attack the gang at the same time the heroine did in a poor attempt of making it sound like it wasn’t plot armor so she wouldn’t be dead during her first mission, but it’s so convenient it can be nothing else besides plot convenience. I mean, really, from every possible moment and every possible place in the whole world, they just appear at the same time and at the same place for the same purpose when it wasn’t preplanned and didn’t know each other? Come on, that’s the exact same case as Deku getting conveniently saved by Almight in the first episode by complete accident. Yet another proof of how the two stories are the exact same type of bull.   

And then they start talking about superpowers and how they work. Boring dialogue where the only thing they are doing is talking about what is essentially magic. Imagine how nicely this is going to translate onto a tv adaptation. People sitting and taking for hours about power levels. Just wonderful, that is what good scene composition is all about. 

And it’s not just scene composition, it’s also common sense. Some villains appear, praise her for not defeating the bad guy and then explain their superpowers to her. They leave and immediately a hero appears who also praises her for not defeating the bad guy and then explains even more superpowers. What the hell. You just met her. You know nothing about her. Why do you praise her and explain all that shit to her? You are not in a briefing room with people you know for a decade. You are in the middle of a street, infodumping crucial information that can easily be your undoing, to a person you just met. It doesn’t make any sense. 

I mean, I know why the author made it as such. It’s so the victimized main character will get a thumbs up from both sides of the conflict, so the dumb readers will think “Man, she must be really special if the elites are favoring her so fast. Look how fast she gained friends in both the villain faction and the hero faction and all of that during her first mission. Whoa! She’s so special!” Go, go, bullied Dekulina, defeat that mean bully Bakugina and become the successor of both Almightia and Alforonia. Yeah, this story is so much better than MHA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/envlvh/a_semiserious_critique_of_worms_the_web_series/,2020-01-12T23:37:59Z,13,0,books,The Notebook,POST
kxn8uj,‘The Paris Hours’ Book Review,"
“Paris is always there, waiting for him on the other side of the door.”

Chapter 39.

Paris, between wars, everyone has lost something. Camille has lost a dear friend, the one who held her biggest secret. The notebook where it was written is now missing. Her reputation depends on it not landing in the wrong hands. Souren is a refugee from Armenia, he has lost his homeland and his family. Then there is the artist Guillaume he has lost a great love and is in a serious debt and has to find the money to pay it or his life could be taken from him. Finally, there is Jean-Paul, a writer, who dreams of America but cannot leave France because he truly believes his daughter is not dead but lost in the streets of Paris.

This is a character driven novel and those are my favorite kind of books to leave. Usually, shorter books seem to be more plot driven but that was not the case for ‘The Paris Hours’. This book is less than 300 pages but I feel like we got to connect with the characters so well in that span of time. (The book only lasts the course of a day.) I will be honest though and tell you, that not all these characters had entertaining chapters. I think Souren and Camille have the best chapters and they were my favorite to read from. I feel like Souren had the strongest story out of all of them and I think it can be applied nicely to the refugee crisis we have seen in recent years. I might have connected with Camille more since she is our only lead female character but I just enjoyed her chapters and her mission to protect herself and her family. Guillaume is our lovesick character. I just did not connect with him and I still do not understand why he was in the debt that he was in. Yes, sometimes I did feel for him but at other times I felt he might be a tad selfish but that is better than having a novel filled with Mary Sues, I just did not connect with his character. Lastly, Jean-Paul, he was not one of my favorite characters but I could really feel the emotion in his chapters. His plot left me with my jaw dropped at times. You could just really connect with him. The characters are getting a five out of five.

‘The Paris Hours’ is a love letter to the city of love that is in its title. This book just gave off such a French aesthetic or vibe. You just instantly feel like you are walking the streets with the Eiffel Tower towering in the smoggy skies of the French capital. The atmosphere also gets a five star.

The writing, the writing! Oh my gosh, the writing is so good in this book. I think it will be an acquired taste, much like other French things. This writing was just so beautiful and so romantic. It never dragged but it never got too fast either. It was such a breath of fresh air to read. I think this writing goes perfect with the setting of France and especially at this somewhat of an awkward time in the country’s history. There is so much I could say but I just cannot get the words out. I think you will understand more when I tell you that the writing is a five out of five star.

“Some things you cannot leave behind. Your history will pursue you doggedly across frontiers and over oceans. It will slip past the unsmiling border guards, fold itself invisibly into the pages of your passport, a silent, treacherous stowaway.”

Chapter 23.

I left the quote above because I think it perfectly describes the plot of this story. We all have a past and there is no running from it, there is no changing it. The past has happened and there is nothing we can do about it except move on. Sometimes we do have to accept it and think about it first though, before we can actually move on. All these characters have a past and that is what is impacting their decisions and the actions that they are taking throughout this day. Again, this is not a real plot heavy book and if that is something that you are into then you probably won’t like your journey reading this I think you really have to dig to find that true plot and story. The plot gets a 4 out of five.

The short chapters really helped with the intrigue. They just leave you wanting more and then you have to wait to get through all the other POVs to get back to the character. It is a good technique. Short and fast chapters will always be the best. I am going to give this a four though because I felt like some we did not really get a wrap on.

I feel like I do have to state that there were some typos throughout the novel, which there are probably some typos in this blogpost so I should not be one to judge but I also do not have an editor. So there were some instances where a space was forgotten and words were pushed together. The biggest however was in the second to last chapter, on page 249; “He is leg is hurting, and he wants to go home.” I am assuming the author meant “His leg is hurting.” I just hate to see things like that in books, maybe there needed to be a better editor on hand.

Time Travels in one direction only. There is no going back.”

Chapter 32.

I really, really, did enjoy this book. I did not think that I would feel that way going on because of the ratings on Goodreads and that I have heard nothing of this book before, I got it from BOTM. This was such a wild card for me, my favorite so far this year. The characters were fabulous, I might not have connected with all of them but that is life, we do not connect for every soul that we meet. I loved the French setting, the author did such a good job dropping us into 1927 Paris. This was the best writing that I have read in a long time. The plot is something that I will not forget. Again, I really enjoyed this book and I will be looking into more books by Alex George.

This book gets the rating of 5 out of 5 stars.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kxn8uj/the_paris_hours_book_review/,2021-01-15T04:45:07Z,0,1,books,The Notebook,POST
co68t,"This excerpt from ""The Boy Who Skipped,"" published on Lulu.com, tells what it was like when the author first saw Saturn through a telescope.  This is a novel by a geek, aimed at geeks and theatre nerds.  There's a love story, an underdog story, and plenty of geeky goodness for everyone. ","""One cold, winter night, I crept out into the snow-covered hillside and set up my little telescope. According to the painfully thin booklet that accompanied it, you should be able to see planets with it, if you could find them. No one I knew knew any of the constellations except the Big Dipper. The Christian bookstore had practically kicked me out for asking for a star map. The books in the library were filled with facts, but none of them had a map I could use to tell which thing was which, and what thing was what. One book had a tiny, cramped map inside the front cover, and I had painstakingly copied it onto poster board because the librarian wouldn’t let me check it out as it was some sort of reference book. 
All I knew from the vague reference books and encyclopedias was that planets were bright, and they didn’t twinkle. So, shivering and clutching a small notebook and flashlight, I set out to look at every bright star until I found a planet. I saw red stars, pale red light flickering as the earth’s atmosphere shifted the light to and fro as it worked its way to my eye. I saw double stars. The moon was not up that night, so I couldn’t look at the Moon Scope’s namesake. Blue stars–Sirius looked like cool water, flowing on a bright winter day into a pool; another star flickered and winked at me, sputtering with an electric blue intensity– I didn’t know its name, but in hindsight I think it might have been Bellatrix or Rigel– –and then, magically, there was Saturn. You can check, if you like; Saturn was relatively near the constellation of Orion in December of 1974, and logic and circumstance tells me that is where it was when I saw it. It was placed to be visible all night, although from our tiny hollow it was only visible for a few hours between the walls of the box we lived in. 
Suspended in space, impossibly, was a tiny ball, with a ring that went around the outside of the ball. The rings make Saturn look very three-dimensional, and unreal. Human eyes cannot perceive color in dim light, and so the pearlescent cold, white light of Saturn fell on my eyes, after traveling over 800 million miles, my mind informed me, and I stared at it for long minutes, wishing I could go there, hoping beyond hope I could gain a chance to work on a telescope big enough to see more.

ktsyp,"23,525 of 32,967 Early English books printed between 1475-1700 can be purchased in facsimile copy from Amazon.com using the search-term: ""EEBO Proquest"".","This is a revision, because I forgot that I could make a text post. The searchable database is [here](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebogroup/). Some general observations:

 - For the past year I had been hunting for original copies of books from the 17th century, and was prepared to pay upwards of $400 for any volumes that I was looking for, until I discovered Early English Books Online, through my university. For a couple weeks I was downloading PDF's of several works, splitting the pages down the middle, and sending them off to Staples to get them printed. And then, my mind was blown, once I realized that this same organization had already done this work for me, and was responsible for releasing these books as hard copies on Amazon.com. Not only that, but a staggering 23,525 titles are available print-on-demand *right now*. Prior to discovering any of this, I had believed that my only gateway to antiquarian books was archive.org, and even then, the majority of the oldest books were not available--these were the ones I was hoping to find serendipitously on eBay.   

- The books are copied in black and white, so compared to original copies of the book, there can sometimes be a loss of rubrication, and a definite absence of: old book smell, tangible letterpress type, authentic ink, original book dimensions, aged hand-made paper, sewn signatures, and gilt-stamped leather bindings. But in return, the scarcity of their contents have been abolished, the prices are affordable, they can be replaced if lost, the bindings are new, and, if I had any say in the matter, they are perfect for replacing all modern editions used in classrooms for literature from this period. For example, there are no longer any barriers in price or quantity for thousands of Shakespeare readers to own printed facsimile copies of his plays from the first folio edition.

- The higher the price (on Amazon.com), the more pages there are. This is especially useful for quickly determining which edition of a particular book has the most content. For the price per page, the most expensive books get you more content per dollar, but that says nothing about the quality of the content. 

- To search by publication date, you can use the search phrase ""EEBO Proquest *nnnn*"", where *nnnn* is any year between 1475-1700.

- The front-covers of every book are color-coded with a stripe indicating the collection the book belongs to. Some of the colors as I have described them are too similar to be useful, so they may be easier to find searching for the category name rather than the color. Unfortunately, as far as I know there is no organized way to find every book listed under a particular collection. These are:

  - Early Literature (Light-Cyan)
  - Early Social Customs (Dark-Cyan)
  - Historical Almanacs (Silver-Pink)
  - Early Documents of Language & Linguistics (Green)
  - Early Documents of World History (Pink)
  - Early English Drama & Theatre (Light Purple)  
  - Early History of Food (Silver-Purple)
  - Early History of Astronomy and Space (Tan)
  - Early History of Military, War, and Weaponry (Orange)
  - Early History of the Law (Yellow)
  - Early History of Religion (Silver-Blue)
  - Early History of Love, Marriage & Sex (Red)
  - Early History of Travel & Geography (Silver-Green)
  - Early History of Kings, Queenes, and Royalty (Lime)
  - Early History of Military, War, and Weaponry (Dark-Orange)   
  - Early History of Medicine, Health & Disease (Light-Orange)
  - Early History of Science, Logic & Math (Purple-Blue)
  - Early History of Industry & Science   
  - Early English Wit, Poetry & Satire
  - Early Fables & Fairy Tales

- As far as I know, books printed entirely in black-letter flourished during the life-time of Elizabeth I (1533 - 1603) and went out of favor by around 1630. I am personally most excited by all of the black-letter books that have been made available on Amazon. Some notable black-letter printers: Wynkyn de Worde, Christopher Barker, Richard Pynson. An *exceedingly* rare edition that I just found is Wynkyn de Worde's [1510 printing of the *Gesta Romanorum*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1171326289/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER).

- The only other facsimile I know of from this period which is currently in print, is [William Tyndale's translation of the New Testament from 1526](http://www.amazon.com/Tyndale-New-Testament-OE-1526-William/dp/1598562908/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1317095304&sr=1-1). The highest quality out-of-print publisher of several hundred books listed in EEBO is Theatrum Orbis Terrarum / The De Capo Press. They are smyth-sewn hardcovers and use mould-made paper, so they are highly recommended alternatives to these EEBO reprints, if you can find them on the second-hand market. The Gregg Press made several facsimiles of early music books, such as John Playford's *Introduction to the Skill of Musick* (1669). For black-letter books, the only publisher I have found has made several facsimiles for the Chetham Society. Here is [a complete list of Chetham Society volumes published since 1843](http://www.chethams.org.uk/chetham_society_pubs.pdf)

- Here are some books from EEBO Proquest that I have personally ordered and very much look forward to reading:

  - Chrysostome, St. John. *An exposition vpon the Epistle of S. Paule the Apostle to the Ephesians* (1581). 
  - Erasmus, Desiderius. *The seconde tome or volume of the Paraphrase of Erasmus vpon the Newe Testament conteynyng the epistles of S. Paul, and the other Apostles* (1549).
  - Granada, Luis de. *Of prayer, and meditation: Wherein are conteined fovvertien deuoute meditations for the seuen daies of the weeke* (1582).
  - Meres, Francis. *Witts academy: a treasurie of goulden sentences, similies and examples: set forth cheefely for the benefitt of young schollers* (1635).
  - Meres, Francis. *Wits common-wealth: The second part. A treasurie of diuine, morall, and phylosophicall similies, and sentences, generally vsefull* (1634).
  - Spencer, John. *Kaina kai palaia: Things new and old, or, A store-house of similies,          sentences, allegories, apophthegms, adagies, apologues, divine, morall, politicall* (1658).

- The primary sources now widely available from EEBO Proquest provide anyone with a treasure-trove of opportunities that can be acquired as soon as you decide what you wish to read. From my experience, knowing what you are interested in reading is half the battle, and is mostly a matter of branching out from what you already know about. As a starting point, I found it very helpful to purchase as many anthologies as I could get my hands on, along with scholarly monographs, which contain extensive notes and bibliographical details. Some excellent and comprehensive anthologies are: Burton Egbert Stevenson's *Home Book of Quotations*, *Home Book of Proverbs Maxims and Familiar Phrases*, *Home Book of Verse*, and Huntington Cairns' *The Limits of Art*. But nothing beats extensive browsing through libraries and used bookstores, with a notebook in hand. 

- If you are in need of suggestions as to where to begin, here is a brief list of words that are commonly used in book titles: *cookery, physick, cabinet, beneficial, delight, chyrurgery, gentleman, piety, liturgy, similies, vade mecum, enchiridion, angels, vertue, vice, satan, chivalry, speculum, looking-glasse, pageant, diverse, recreations, comedie, saints, sermons, homilies, scourge, noble, salve, mechanick, bible, psalms, musick, apothecary, herbal, compendious, eloquence, viol, ayre, husbandry, kalendar, wisdom, truth, beast, conquest, primitive, monument, epigram, choicest, pieces, orders, orthographie, rudiments, globe, tutor, sundry, Greek, Roman, Spanish, Indian, German, naval, master, doctor, reverend, conference, creed, crucified, declaration, majesties, anno, domini, serpent, antiquity, prepared, heavenly, blessed, secrets, warre, clear, dictionary, cobler, construction, calumny, hunting, martyr, tyranny, builder, legacy, library, temple, castle*.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ktsyp/23525_of_32967_early_english_books_printed/,2011-09-28T05:28:44Z,11,24,books,The Notebook,POST

pe4wtw,The value of the commonplace book,"I recently began taking notes in a commonplace book. I began with OneNote and then moved to an application called Notion (recommended). The CPB is a single location for all your notes on books you’ve read. I use a different main tab for each book, then sub-tabs for different themes or ideas I want to record.

For example, I was reading Churchill’s memoir ‘My Early Life’ (a fantastic book), and an observation on one of his experiences occurred to me. So I developed my thoughts under a sub-tab.

The benefit of the CPB is you can rediscover those ideas that only occur to you in the depths of your reading experience - ideas that you wouldn’t necessarily otherwise remember. You can also connect ideas across texts, authors, genres etc. And you can develop/capture your thoughts quickly and easily.

I’m wondering if others do this, and, if so, which online or IT tools they use?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pe4wtw/the_value_of_the_commonplace_book/,2021-08-29T22:08:40Z,9,12,books,The Notebook,POST
15r3vk,For the past 8 years I have kept track of every book I've read.,"So 8 years ago my New Year's resolution was to read 50 books in a year.  I failed, but I continued to keep track of all the books I read year after year with the date I finished.  I don't included the books abandon halfway through, which explains some of the gaps in time.

8etqd4,Book Review: Lead the Field by Earl Nightingale,"**One\-Sentence Summary of Lead the Field :** To succeed in life you can't just count on luck and circumstances; you must find hidden nuggets inside yourself rather than traipsing around the world in vain looking for them, have goals and desires and define them clearly, have an attitude that sets you up for success and love yourself, use your brain as a resource for reflection every day, understand that our rewards in life always correspond to the services we deliver, learn without ceasing and continue to grow, develop your vocabulary and mastery of language, leave the flock to act on your own, understand your value and the value of several tens of millions of euros, clearly define the amount of money you want to earn, economize or invest and save for your retirement, have a personal library that is rich and relevant, do your best every day and, one by one, accomplish the tasks that will lead you to be successful in your goals, specialize in something; then you will be in the top 5&#37; of humanity who find themselves at the top of the success pyramid \-\- whatever that is.

By Earl Nightingale, 102 pages, published in 2007 \(book\) and in 1986 \(audio cassette\)

Summary and Book Report:

I am not going to write a biography \- even a short one \- for all the authors in my PMBA challenge, but Earl Nightingale seems to be a rather interesting personality, and atypical enough to warrant an exception:

Earl Nightingale is a famous orator in the United States, and an example of what self education can do for someone who starts out with plenty of things going against him. Born in 1921, raised by his mother who was left alone with his two brothers, he grew up in a poor Los Angeles suburb in the middle of the depression. Wishing to understand why some people are poor and miserable and others are not, and not finding anyone in his acquaintance who could answer, he began his quest for answers and knowledge in the local library, which would lead him particularly to a study of philosophy, psychology and the great religions for decades. After the war, during which he survived, with 12 marines, an attack on the battleship USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor \(1103 dead out of 1511 crew members\), he worked in radio and created one of the first audio books, The Strangest Secret, which is a best seller and sold more than a million copies. He went on to found, with Lloyd Conant, the Nightingale\-Conant Corporation, the first company to offer audio cassettes about personal development. He died in 1989.

Lead the field is a collection of advice about personal development, originally only offered in audio format. Fortunately, a book offering an exact transcription was published, which allowed me to read it and to offer you a review \- it is a lot harder for me to understand spoken English than written, and while audio books have undeniable advantages, such as being able to do other things while you read them, and use the time in transit or traveling for self improvement, I much prefer a good book when it comes to soaking up knowledge, reflecting and taking notes. I love to write post\-it notes which I stick on the paragraphs that speak to me \- difficult to do that with an audio CD.

In this book, which is enthusiastic and brimming with energy, Earl Nightingale insists on the fact that success in life is not due to luck and circumstances, but to principles based on good sense and habits that are easy to acquire on the condition that you practice them every day. I will paint you a panoramic, chapter by chapter:

Introduction

Our daily environment is a merciless reflection of ourselves. Everyone we meet and come into contact with every day will always react in response to our attitude. And we can control this attitude, every morning when we start our day. If we are cheerful, happy and enjoy the miracle of life, others will return this cheerfulness and good humor. We will be the kind of person that others like to have around them. Test it: treat each person that you come in contact with as the most important person on earth. You will quickly see the difference that it creates.

Acres of Diamonds

In the 19th century, an African farmer heard stories about the success of other farmers who had made millions by discovering diamond mines. Excited by the prospect, he sold his farm and took off in search of diamonds, a long and fruitless search that left him alone and penniless in the end. He threw himself into a river and drowned. The man who bought the farm noticed a blue and red shiny stone one day at the bottom of a brook, he picked it up and, finding it very pretty, he placed it on the mantle. Some days later, a visitor picked it up, went pale and told the farmer that the stone he had picked up was an enormous diamond. The farmer, astounded, told the visitor that his brook was full of stones like that. The farm that the first farmer had sold to go in search of diamonds, turned out to be one of the most productive diamond mines on the African continent. He had sold it for a mouthful of bread to search elsewhere for something that was in front of his nose. He would have known that had he taken the time to prepare himself and to learn what a diamond in the rough looks like.

What does that tell you? That we all have diamond fields, we only have to recognize them and exploit them. All you need is the patience and wisdom to explore intelligently and effectively the work you are already doing. Everything we do is rich with opportunity. But the opportunities don't glow in the dark, are are not written on neon signs. In order to spot them you have to look with new eyes. All too often we don't question what already exists because if millions of people are doing it, it must be the best way to do it. But it's not the best way; its the average, ordinary way.

To put it into practice: Begin by taking an hour a day with a notebook to sketch out your work. Try to see with new eyes and examine all the ingredients. Opportunities are there \- fields of diamonds.

A Worthy Destination

The United states is overflowing with immigrants who come here to escape appalling conditions in their countries, who all started over from nothing with everything against them \- without wealth, without knowing the language, without material possessions \- and who have succeeded in a remarkably short amount of time. And this was a wonderful experience for them filled with happiness. Why? Because freedom is the most precious thing \- and the most rare \- on earth. By coming to the United States, they have been able to taste it and intoxicate themselves on something that is taken for granted by most Americans.

So it is with all our desires: once we have realized them, enjoying them on a daily basis becomes something we take for granted, and they lose a great deal of their interest and their magic. It is desire, more than realizing desire, that makes us happy. Children are happiest on Christmas morning when the wrapped presents await them under the tree than once the surprise and the suspense is over; we are happier going to the restaurant than coming home; happier when we are leaving on vacation than when we return. And we are happier when we are pursuing our goals relentlessly than when we have reached them.

Success is the progressive accomplishment of an objective that is worth the effort. Success lies in the journey towards the objective \- the desire \- rather than the objective itself \- the accomplishment.

Don't let's waste our resources and our precious and limited time on useless objectives. Let's define worthwhile objectives. According to Earl Nightingale, only 5&#37; of the population succeed in attaining success that is out of the ordinary. For the rest, average is a good thing.

Therefore it is important to set worthwhile goals, and to set more once you reach them. Every day of our lives we should be engaged, advancing, and learning and looking out for higher heights from which to set out again. But in order to do so you must know what you want.

You will become whatever you think of yourself.

Miracles of Your Mind

We are the only species on earth to be endowed with the power to shape our lives in accordance with images we see in our mind. Everything that has been done by humans is the result of following goals and objectives.

On a more individual level, everything we have \- our work, our relationships with our family and others, our philosophy of life \- is the result of the use we have put our mind to.

Now, scientists think that we use on average only 10&#37; of our brain's capacity. If everything you have accomplished up until now is thanks to only 10&#37; of your brain, what do you think we could achieve if we were to use 20&#37;?

Note: I am not in agreement with this statement by the author:  the fact that we are using 10&#37; or less of our brain is a rehash of an old idea first presented by American psychologist William James in 1908 and does not really reflect what we know today about how the brain works. Look here for that information. I do, however, agree with the general idea: ""we do not think enough.""

Now, unfortunately, schools do not teach us to think, and it is by thinking that we will find creative solutions for how to make better use of our brain and its awesome power.

There is a simple way to make better use of our brain: every day, take a piece of paper, write at the top our primary objective, then write underneath all the ideas that come into our head to help up reach this goal. Do this for an hour. We can easily come up with about 20 ideas a day on paper. Some of these ideas won't be feasible, or practical, but even if we only do this 5 days a week, 40 weeks a year, we will have 4,000 ideas at our disposal to help us reach our goals. And this will only have taken us 200 hours, out of 8,760. If we subtract about 2,920 hours for sleep, and about 1,645 hours for work, that leaves us 3,995 leisure hours. Never in the history of humanity have we had so much time to devote to things other than work. Using 5&#37; of our supplemental free time to think could completely change our lives: a single big idea could revolutionize our work or our entire lives. One out of 4,000. Or 40,000 \- one big idea every 10 years would be more than enough!

Destiny in the Balance

Our rewards in life are always in accordance with the services we perform. It is a universal and general law, the law of cause and effect. Services include our thoughts, our work, our actions, our words.

Before looking for rewards, we must reflect upon our services and improve them. This law appears simple and yet it is, for the most part, misunderstood and ignored by all. There are so many people who lean against a mantle where the fire has gone out in a freezing room and say ""Give me a light and I will put wood on the fire."" People whine because they receive bad service or bad treatment \- when the problem comes from their service to themselves, which is not worthy of the rewards they expect.

Rather than worrying about what the future will bring, we would be better off using our wasted energy to find and improve our services \- to improve ourselves \- by thinking of the best ways to do so. But so many people will do I don't know what in this world, even resorting to crime, before they will THINK.

Seed for Achievement

The seed for achievement is integrity. Integrity is honesty and truth, with others and with yourself. If we are at peace with ourselves, we cannot be false towards others. If our words carry integrity, our sleep will not be troubled and we will respected everywhere we go.

There is nothing we cannot accomplish if we live by this principle from the inside out. To be honest with oneself implies taking responsibility to use what we have to the utmost. And what we have, our under\-utilized mind, our abilities, our talents and our time. These are our possessions, which we carry with us everywhere, which represent a huge fortune. It is the investment of this fortune which determines our return on investment. It is what makes us autonomous human beings, even though most people are not aware of this.

In order to respect our integrity, and be honest and true to ourselves, we must do our best in every circumstance, therefore. Life is  a piece of fertile land which is waiting for us to sow our seeds in it. It cannot return anything if you don't plant it.

It's Easier to Win

Only 5&#37; of people succeed in reaching an unusual goal. These are the people that earn the highest salaries, who live in the best part of town, the most comfortable houses, have the best education, the good things of life, and make the greatest contribution to their communities.

The average man, or average woman, grows up imitating their environment. They think like all their friends think. They  take the life they live for granted. Everyone they like is in the same group. They are in this group as well, and as long as they are not unusually motivated to leave it, they will become an indistinguishable member of it. They do this because it is natural to do it. The group's objectives, or lack of objectives, become their own. It requires their minimum ability all the years of their life. It is not necessary, because all the industrialized countries are so rich and dynamic that the majority of people don't need to shift into second or third gear to reach a decent standard of living.

No\-one has ever told this young man or this young woman: ""Look. There are two very different groups in our society. There are different layers in the socio\-economic pyramid. Here is the 5&#37; at the top of the pyramid. Now, this is what we call the middle class, and it is divided into two main groups. And at the bottom you find the lower class, those who, for innumerable reasons, need help from everyone else. Now, look: we are living here, at this level of the pyramid. It is neither the highest, nor the lowest in society. That is where I wanted to be, and your mother and I are perfectly happy here. And where do you want to be?""

Where do you want to be?

People who succeed follow an independent path. At some moment in their life they decide to leave the cocoon of their social group and set out on their own path. And it is easier to win there. There is less competition higher up.

Note : this description of the levels of society seems to me simplistic and relevant at the same time. It is clear that Earl Nightingale is interested in sociology. To learn more, I invite you to begin by researching the Wikipedia article on social classes.

How Much Are You Worth

Every human life is priceless, but the tangible and intangible payments that we receive in life vary a great deal. We are all unique, but what are the services that we offer?

Think of yourself as a company. You are the president of the company, and you are responsible for its success or failure. You and the members of your family are shareholders in the company, and it is your responsibility to increase the value of the shares year after year. Your family has faith in you and invests a great deal in you, and it's up to you to prove that their faith is justified.

A complicated company can be divided into four departments: 1\) financial; 2\) production; 2\) sales; and 4\) research. Take away one of these ingredients and the company is destined more or less to failure in the long run. Don't neglect these four parameters for ourselves.

Research is the most commonly ignored operation. You would be surprised by the enormous number of people who stop learning once school is over. Other than company manuals and technical documentation, they read only a very small number of books of any real value. Well, knowledge is power.

Let's Talk About Money

Someone who has specialized skills in our society is worth more money than a person with basic skills that can be easily replaced. That doesn't mean that he is more important from a strictly humanistic point of view, just that his services are better paid. A janitor is just as important from a human point of view as a neurosurgeon, but he is more easily replaced \- anyone can be trained to clean floors in a few days or weeks \- while a neurosurgeon has spent many years learning his profession, often at the price of great personal sacrifice and at great expense, and he cannot be easily replaced. Thus the neurosurgeon can earn more in a day that the janitor makes in a year.

Therefore, what we earn is related to what we can give and what is asked. But how much do you want to earn?

There are two steps to reach the level of income that we want:

Decide how much money we really want, the exact amount.

Once you have made the decision, you must forget about money and concentrate on improving what we are doing and the services we offer.

One Thing You Can't Hide

Knowledge intelligently applied is power, and everyone needs knowledge \- and in this information age, to an unprecedented degree in the history of humanity. A person's degree of ignorance will determine his place in the world. Everyone is born ignorant, and must, for a moment, live in ignorance, but all those who remain ignorant can only blame themselves.

People who lead the field are the top 5&#37; of the pyramid are those who know the most. They have a better command of the language and send their children to the best schools than most of the population. This might seem surprising, but a correlation exists between the quality of your spoken language, and the number of words you know, with your social and economic success. Actually a good command of the language is an asset in every aspect of your life; language immediately reveals certain things about us, and notably our socio\-cultural level and where we belong on the social pyramid. Language indicates the social status to which we belong.

 Reader's Digest published an article by Blake Clarke entitleld ""Words can work wonders for you,"" in which he reports on a scientific study of 350,000 people showing a surprising correlation between vocabulary levels and richness of language and economic and social success. So it is important to develop your vocabulary and to use language that is varied, accurate and relevant.

Note : I was not able to find this article, but it seems that Reader's Digest has published numerous versions \- at least 8 \- of this book \(which is not actually an article\) from 1972 to 1985. It seems that the book has been re\-edited since the 80s. Look here and there for more information.

In any case, it seems obvious to me that the choice of words and their richness are important to effective communication. I am getting a lot out of batting around this old idea, taught in various courses around world \- often by NLP practitioners who look no further than the end of their nose \- according to which words only account for 7&#37; of a conversation \(followed by 38&#37; for your voice, and 55&#37; for gestures and facial expressions.\) These figures come from a study in the 70s by Albert Mehrabian, an American psychologist. He explains, in one sentence on his web page touting the merits of his book ""Silent Messages \-\- A Wealth of Information About Nonverbal Communication \(Body Language\)"", that ""Unless a communicator is talking about their feelings or attitudes, these equations are not applicable."" What seems to be more important, in fact, is the coherence between words, voice and gestures. To learn more, I found this most interesting passage on the subject:

However Mehrabian's numbers have been called ""exaggerated and suspect,"" by non verbal language specialists such as Judee Burgoon, David Buller and Gill Woodall. The saying: ""it's not what you say that counts; it's the way that you say it"" is a half truth, according to these specialists. Their analysis of over 100 studies showed that Mehrabian's research minimizes the importance of words. The relative impact of non verbal and verbal language depends on the context of the meeting. In reality, the degree of persuasion necessary considerably influences the impact of the two different types of language in one's delivery. For example, when it is an important presentation \(argument, conference..\) the distribution of impact sources is reversed. Body language goes from 55&#37; to 32&#37;, tone of voice from 38&#37; to 15&#37; and the message \(words\) goes from 7&#37; to 53&#37; of the impact.

Therefore, it is important to develop your knowledge in the general area that naturally interests us. We are all interested in something. Read books to learn more about that subject area, but also for fun. Begin a systematic study in your field of interest.

Finally, a personal quality library is essential for success.

Today's Greatest Adventure

A life is made up of days which become weeks, months, and years. Let's reduce that to the least common denominator: one day, and finally one task in that day.

This day is a brick which you use to build your house. Sometimes we see a builder start to build a wall, brick by brick, and we think of the amount of work left for him to do. And then one day, some weeks or some months later,  a whole house is standing in the place where the builder was working.

Thus it is in our lives: if we place each of our stones successfully, we will be able to build a magnificent tower. To get in the habit of success, the only thing to do is succeed in the little tasks that we assign ourselves each day.

Try out this idea that was purchased for $25.00: ""Every day, write down on a piece of paper 6 important tasks for that day. Then rate them in order of importance. Then do them, one by one. If you don't get to the last ones, let it be because you would not have been able to do it at all.""

This method will allow you to stop worrying about tomorrow. You can relax happy in the knowledge that successful tasks means successful days and that makes a successful life.

The Person on the White Horse

To lead the field it is important that we are the leaders in our own lives, and also that our services are so important and irreplaceable that others come to us for them. For that, we must specialize and become believable in a specific area of our work. Become a vital part of the organization which we are in.

Book Critique:

Lead the field is a collection of  extremely relevant advice for succeeding in life, as you can see from this summary. The majority of the advice is practical, easy to apply and has the potential to change our lives. I think that I will start with the main advice in chapter Miracles of Your Mind and put my ideas down on paper, every day of the week. Many years ago, I learned to play the guitar by getting up half an hour earlier every day, I think that I will do the same thing now, to think and have ideas.

Finally, this book is absolutely excellent, with very few weak points \- Earl Nightingale touts his other audio products a bit too much for my taste, and he makes one mistake about the level of brain function \- but an enormous number of strong points. A must read.

Strong Points:

A lot of practical, relevant and easy to use advice.

1m5tk0,Rilke's only novel: The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge,"I've just finished the first book, and already I think it's pretty special. One of those either plotless books or books with a plot that can be summed up in two-three sentences, and yet it can make you linger hungrily on every page (much like the way Moby Dick, To the Lighthouse, Gass' The Tunnel, Beckett's novels, many more feel). The prose is on fire page by page. I can't unhear: ""Somewhere a pane of glass shatters, I hear the big fragments laugh, the small splinters titter.""


But it's also a bit uneven, and not just for the stream of consciousness. I have some aesthetic trouble with his combining impressionist and expressionist techniques. Sometimes it can be pretty breathtaking to watch the narrator move between two forms of representation so fluidly, and at the same time it's jarring. Something pulls me away from an image and makes me curious about the formal technique and what he's trying to do by representing it in such a way rather than the picture at hand. Is this intentional or was Rilke messing around trying to find the right tools?


Starting book two now. I understand how it's not as seamless as the poetry, and a lot of it is clearly foregrounding (thematically, morally, and aesthetically) for what Rilke would do with the Elegies and Orpheus, but I'm still curious to hear what some of your impressions are about it. I'm even more curious to see if anyone thinks it's garbage. Either way, I can't recall it ever being brought up on this sub before. 


I'm reading the Burton Pike translation by the way.

In broader terms there had to be the consideration that everything around Winston is constructed by the party from the moment he purchased the notebook from Mr Charrington’s shop, what with Charrington being a member of the thought police and ensnaring Winston into the trap. 

What are your opinions on this?

Edit: just want to pop in here that I think this is the greatest novel ever written and all opinions are welcome. I think the world has lots to learn from Orwell and it’s discussions like this that can help us look at reflections of our own time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/11g151h/does_anybody_share_my_view_that_every_additional/,2023-03-02T12:06:31Z,46,137,literature,The Notebook,POST

vrlae7,"Is there an idea in literary theory that the coherency of complicated sci-fi concepts (e.g., time loops and parallel universes) is less important than the feelings, emotions and symbolism that they provide?","I know that the title is a mouthful, so hopefully I can explain with an example from a video game.

In *Bioshock: Infinite*, the main character, Booker, rescues a woman named Elizabeth from a flying city to wipe away his debt. Elizabeth was being held captive by the man who founded the flying city, Comstock. 

Through a bunch of parallel universe shenanigans, it turns out that:

- Booker and Comstock are simply alternate versions of each other from different partalel universes. 

- Elizabeth is Booker's daughter.

- To make sure that Comstock doesn't go on to create the flying city and cause a lot of suffering, Elizabeth has to drown Booker at a certain point in his life, before he has the chance to become Comstock.

That last bit is the emotional finale of the game and it affected me very much. As people pointed out, however, the ending doesn't make much sense when taking the  parallel universes into account. Others said they were so confused by what was going on that they couldn't be emotionally effected by Elizabeth drowning Booker.

I was effected by it though, and I find that I'm much less concerned with coherency in difficult narrative elements, than with the emotional impact of those elements.

s5zhs9,The body-shaming in The Hating Game really disturbs me,"It’s just so unnecessarily mean. Sally Thorne at one point in the book describes how MMC (Josh) is so masculine and could easily carry FMC (Lucy) unlike her past sexual partners who had a “boyish” spine that would break under her weight. Implying that they’re unmasculine just because they don’t work out as much as Josh (who’s incredibly ripped). Not to mention, countless mentions of height. Making fun of small men who previously dated Lucy. 

Josh, to diminish Danny (whom Lucy initially likes, and whom Josh is then jealous of) even says at another point in the book, that Danny’s “small” and laughs. A backhanded remark making fun of his height and stature. 

Height isn’t something you can change, similar to how women can’t miraculously change their natural bust size to fit the tastes of men. Body shaming goes 2 ways. I don’t know but this just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth. You can make MMC sexy WITHOUT putting down other men. And making fun of things they genuinely cannot alter

I might have to drop this book. It makes me feel so bad reading it. It ruins my momentum and focus",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/s5zhs9/the_bodyshaming_in_the_hating_game_really/,2022-01-17T08:55:02Z,61,332,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

nensz7,I didn't like the hating game by Sally Thorne! Reasons listed:,"1. First of all, height isn't a personality trait for both Lucy and Joshua.
2. Lucy lusting for Joshua and just creepily obsessing over his body and talking about his bod when he's not comfortable and idk why sniffing him was really weird and creepy. 
3. Josh said multiple times I'm more than just my body and she completely disregarded it, imagine if the roles were reversed and it was guy who was constantly begging for sex and sexualizing every single thing she was doing.
4. what happened to visiting her parents and her ex best friend Val? Why were they brought up so often?  what was the point of these subplots?
5. Josh tallying when she wore a dress or a skirt or when she smiled was really creepy tbh.
6. My girl Lucy has some wild WILD imagination, she's playing this hating game while I read the first ten page and said he loves her. (before the elevator scene)
7. her getting mad over little things wasn't cute, she had no right being mad at josh for his ""reasons"" to bring her to wedding because she was treating him as one night stand till then. 
8. the sex was meh??? the first scene had potential but josh kept on delaying having sex for what?? to have some bland vanilla ass sex? it wasn't spicy at all. I expected more for the sex we waited for 320 pages or smth. 
9. also the fact that Lucy only thinks about josh and his body is just so uncomfy to me 
10. josh was a decent character, people call him weird but I guess he's just not a very emotionally available character tho he does have redeeming traits HOWEVER who goes to gym 3 times a day?
11. last one, when Lucy was sick why was she acting like she was drunk 

&#x200B;

That's all!! please share your opinion, why you guys liked it and what you didn't like (agree with me). I know it's an old book but I found it so boring and bland while there was so much hype for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/nensz7/i_didnt_like_the_hating_game_by_sally_thorne/,2021-05-17T18:25:07Z,121,194,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

I liked the Hating Game, though it was ok, but didn’t quite hit the spot (e.g. where’s my epilogue??!). However, I loved the Love Hypothesis. It has it’s flaws, sure, but I was super wrapped up in the story and I really enjoyed it. 
My theory is this: you either love the Hating Game and dislike or feel meh about the Love Hypothesis or you love the Love Hypothesis and dislike or feel meh about the Hating Game.

11v81da,Just can't get over how absolutely perfect The Hating Game is❤️,"It's the most believable enemies to lovers books I've read. It's the most perfect romance book I've read in a while, so beautifully written. Simple and straightforward. 

At the beginning, it's so easy to relate with Lucy. Almost gives me 'persuation' vibes. I could feel all the homesickness and the loneliness she felt living alone in a big city. I love how unorganised and creative she is. The tension between them when she's wearing that short black dress and the elevator kiss immediately after I'd surreal. The slow burn after that building up to the hotel room fucking is just delicious...😩

It's the cutest relationship ever. She's creative and unorganised. He's strict to the point of OCD, calculating and extremely organised. He so beautifully handles all her freakouts.

And I can't even describe how incredibly sexy I find Josh. A guy with a knack for finance who also is so freakin shredded😍. Oh and he knows exactly what to say and when. 'You're always beautiful'. And all that about him wanting Lucy to be his Easter egg...I just can't. He just seems so so real to me. Gives me hope that there's someone handsome and intense out there to 'not hate' me too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/11v81da/just_cant_get_over_how_absolutely_perfect_the/,2023-03-19T01:59:43Z,49,145,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

myxi7r,Lucy in The Hating Game,"I think this is going to have to be a DNF for me which I'm really sad about, I was really enjoying it but Lucy is so immature. I could deal with the lack of boundaries and being weird when she was delusional but it just doesn't stop (I'm at about 59%) They are meant to be next in line for exec positions but they and her especially are acting like they are there on school placement.

Also it's becoming apparent that I find it much easier to suspend disbelief and accept in magic and shifters compared to human resources continuing to put up with their shit and breaching data protection so easily. That's probably my professional integrity getting insulted though. 😂

qbqnl4,The Hating Game…expected more.,"I’m already writing up my opinion on The Hating Game but right now, I just NEED to know: was anyone else a bit disappointed by the spice in THG? 

Everytime this book was recommended, people always said the ~spice~ in it was insane, so well written, so..spicy, and I just did not get that at all when I read it. I was underwhelmed. It sucks because the tension was there, all the times Josh withheld physical touch from Lucy, all of the teasing…just for the spice to be written like that. 

If I’m being honest, I expected waaaay more dirty talk. Their relationship was built off of bickering, I expected Thorne to kinda play into that brat/dom feel a bit more, which never happened. We just got more quirky conversation, which I loved during the other scenes, but I was kinda annoyed at it while they were literally bumping uglies…like, give it a rest. 

Idk, I wish some of these authors would read some fanfiction and see how to write mind-blowing spice. The whole book was leading up to them finally doing something about their tension, them even having full blown conversations about it, and then something vanilla and boring came from it. 

I kept hoping there was one more scene where I was like oh..I see what everyone was talking about but no, all I got was Robin’s egg blue walls (shut up about each other’s blue eyes already).

So, did anyone else feel this way or am I just a little creep that desires way too much detail and refuses to leave anything to the imagination?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/qbqnl4/the_hating_gameexpected_more/,2021-10-20T02:11:44Z,39,73,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST
q80w9j,Please help me find something to read after The Hating Game,"Firstly I have read  loads of posts on this but I'm still struggling. I need a book to read after The Hating Game, which I absolutely ADORED and to keep me entertained until we get more info on the movie release. The things I loved about it and am looking for in a another book are:

-enemies to lovers trope, specially office romance as I like that they have to see each other daily

-witty banter

-sexual tension and great sex scenes, no fade to black

-some kind of caretaker scene. I found it really sweet when Josh took care of a very sick Lucy

-the misunderstood MMC

-not many other storylines except the main couple, possibly like the idea that both don't seem to be lonely

v66w0m,I finally watched the Hating Game movie and I owe the movie an apology 🙏🏽,"I wasn’t convinced at all by the trailers. 
My first thought was « Austin Stowell is NOT Josh, the elevator scene is totally changed. And it won’t work without Lucy’s internal dialogue, no no no, I don’t want to watch it » 

Then I was bored and decided to give it a try and … I loved it. 
I replayed the kiss scene in front of Josh appartement at least ten times. 

I thought Josh was not grumpy enough in the trailer, but I noticed that instead Stowell played it with a light smirk that fits so well with the character.
Lucy Hale delivered just the right amount of quirkiness without being too annoying. She is sometimes annoying, but it feels like it was made on purpose and I liked it.

qz0yty,The Hating Game,"Why does everyone like this book??

I've seen a few other posts from people who didn't love it, but they all seem to be centered around how immature Lucy is. Which, fair, but can we also talk about how outright cruel and abusive Josh is to her in the beginning? I mean, he calls her ""pathetic"" multiple times. There's being awkwardly mean, a la Mr. Darcy, and then there's just being a dick (not in the good way). 

And she's obviously affected by it, since she tells him that he's ""broken"" her to the extent that she can't handle another man calling her beautiful.

On top of that, he friggin talks about how much he wants to kill her when they're alone in the elevator. I'm sorry, but when you could easily physically overpower someone -- and that someone hasn't indicated that they want you to -- that's just terrifying.

Is it just me? I do enjoy some of the one liners in the book (""He's seen and heard almost everything now. There's nothing left to do but fake my own death and start a new life.""), but I'm not sure the good outweighed the bad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/qz0yty/the_hating_game/,2021-11-21T18:22:03Z,27,51,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

hfl1kx,Who else didn't like The Hating Game? :0,"This post has spoilers! :-0

I finished The Hating Game recently. It was a 3/10 star read for me, and I struggle to see why it has such high ratings. 

I don't even know where to begin with what I dislike about the book. We have two assistants sharing a room who passive aggressively stare at each other a lot and 'play' other vague games. They aren't particularly mean and even when they didn't like each other, the banter was playful and pretty fun. Lucy acts a little too dramatically, too frequently, and Joshua progressively reveals how obsessed he is with her. >!Love at first sight when he was still in a relationship with someone else? Painting his room to match her eyes soon after he meets Lucy?!!< Is this not creepy? There was nothing that likeable about Lucy either, despite the author spelling it out on numerous occasions that everyone loves her. >!In this book she's rooted through Joshua's possessions when he was away from his desk and photocopied his planner too. She's also basically thrown him out as soon as she felt better from her fever, despite Joshua looking after her all night and calling his doctor brother over too.!<

I've just started Strictly Business and it seems to follow the exact template of The Hating Game? Publishing house that's undergoing an acquisition (in the hating game it was a merger). Surly but sexy nemesis from the acquiring company is your professional counterpart but always seems one step ahead.

The main character is obsessed with being liked and is just a very 'rainbow and sunshine' type of person. They're reluctantly sexually attracted to each other but disguise it with professional criticism and childish digs? The love interest also has a nicer brother and issues with his father and there's a wedding type event looming. And the main character is a small town girl whose looked down on by the guy. 

I'm not very far in but the similarities are striking. I loved the hating game though so I don't mind, just thought it was odd that people can get away with that, but then again it happens all the time with movies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/18q53u0/is_strictly_business_by_carrie_elks_basically_the/,2023-12-24T22:12:32Z,8,1,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

14g8y0q,Looking for a book with a FMC like in The Hating Game,"I've just finished a re-read of ""The Hating Game"" by Sally Thorne and I think it might be my favorite contemporary romance book. Not only I love the relationship between the MMC and the FMC, their banter and even their creepiness/weirdness, but I also absolutely love the FMC's personality. 

I know she isn't everyone's cup of tea but I really like her quirky personality and her blunts and over-the-top thoughts and comments. She's over dramatic but always in a funny way and the writing style is so great, short sentences and a lot of humor. 

I've read a fair amount of books with the enemies to lovers trope (which I love), but I've never found the same amazing chemistry. But do you know books with a FMC a bit like Lucy?

I’ve also found The Unhoneymooners by Christina Lauren to be such a great, funny read! 

Books I’ve read that I could hardly get through include Beach Read and The Love Hypothesis, which I find recommended a lot but just wasn’t my thing! 

I’m about to start The Spanish Love Deception, as this is also highly recommended.

To help, I asked her some questions and based on her answers, I think her likes are:

1. Explicit sex
2. Slow burn is OK, but she wants more than just one sex scene at the end
3. Contemporary Romance is ideal, she doesn't like fantasy settings. I'm not sure about Historical Romance.
4. She enjoys both Female POV and Dual POV (side note, if anyone has any good recommendations for Dual POV, throw them out there - I really enjoy Dual POV!)

m0x7hm,The Hating Game?,"I enjoyed it. The couple had crazy chemistry and dialogue was really clean and believable. A few grievances is the narration being needlessly dramatized so often and the protagonist being creepily sexual in her elaborate descriptions of Joshua. Every. Single. Time. The paintball and sickness episode was cliche and hard to read. But there's a lot I appreciated about this book. I have to say their office mind games are simply a JOY to witness. I loved the wedding part and what it did for their relationship and Joshua as a character. I LOVE ELAINE TOO LOL! 

Can anyone recommend me a book with the gender roles reversed (FMC - serious and icy exterior) (MMC - goofy and generally normal)? Except tone done the sexual fantasies and lusting on part of POV. This is gonna sound petty but I‘m not impressed by hunk physique. Joshua has no physical weaknesses. I like when the MMC has physical insecurities about being thin or short LOL. It's not mandatory though so don’t let it influence anything too much. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Please arrogance is a big no no. I'm ok with arrogance but only in small doses. If it's a defining character trait I will drop the book.

rdp4c8,"Looking for a less predictable, more intense E2L version of The Hating Game","*The Hating Game* seems to be a polarising book in this forum, and my take on it is that even though I initially liked it, I realised how incredibly cliché and unoriginal it was. I noticed this specially after reading *The Spanish Love Deception*, which is quite the copycat of THG and a book I couldn't even force myself to finish because of how frustrated I was with it.

I would like to find a book with a similar setting (coworker rivalry/kinda slowburn) but with these differences:

* The dislike between the characters is more intense/real (no "">!I fell in love with you the first time I saw you!<"" bullshit)
* *OR* Indifference. You know those people who work together, but feel so indifferent towards each other it's almost worst than being enemies?
* I would prefer the FMC NOT to be the/a sunshine. Give me a faded heroine disillusioned with the world. Give me anguish!
* No tiny woman/massive man pairing, PLEASE.
* I'd prefer an average looking/plain FMC
* I do not oppose hot MMCs (I'm a hypocrite lol)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/rdp4c8/looking_for_a_less_predictable_more_intense_e2l/,2021-12-11T02:16:35Z,29,34,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

lpaazw,Perfect for fans of the hating game,"Would like to meet by Rachel Winters narrated by Laura Hobson is the perfect slow burn Britlit romcom. Perfect for fans of the hating game, flatshare, and you deserve each other. 

I almost shelved it but after waiting weeks/months to borrow it from the library I didn’t know when I would be able to pick it back up again and forced myself to listen. So glad I did because I’ve been listening to unremarkable books lately and this book is quickly becoming a favorite!

Evie is a PA, working for an asshole boss. To avoid losing her job she is forced to help the agency’s famous client write a screenplay by trying out famous meet cutes she’s seen in romcoms. It has a slow start and the meet cutes are definitely cheesy but the characters are super likable. The writing is clever carrying some laugh out loud moments. >!I’ve got 3 hours to go and the ex just walked in 😱!<. I’m on the edge and I just can’t wait to see what happens.

qoctln,If anyone wants more Josh/Lucy (The Hating Game),"I've been kinda on a dry spell when it comes to finding a good book lately. But the Hating Game trailer that came out the other day just reminded me of how much I loved that book (not the movie trailer much to my disappointment unfortunately) so I went hunting for more books/stories similar to the Hating Game. 

I didn't find a such book but I found this really good fanfiction of THG on AO3. It's called [The Starting Over Game](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30174513). It's a continuation of what happens after the book and it's completed. 

I think the author did a good job capturing the characterization and the tone of the book. It's not as funny or as outrageous as Sally Thorne's Lucy's inner monologues but it's still a good read if anyone wants more of Josh/Lucy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/qoctln/if_anyone_wants_more_joshlucy_the_hating_game/,2021-11-07T00:12:35Z,8,83,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

And the MMC is convinced that the FMC hates them but? 

I don't think I've come across this. Maybe because he FMC in these novels are usually the MCs and we follow their thoughts around?

I personally can't think of any romance novel I've enjoyed where the MMC's perspective is the main or only one in any case. I feel because their thoughts just go sexual so quickly and it's kind of odd to me.

kb81cx,"I just read The Hating Game and found it to be super, super underwhelming. Anyone else think so, too?","So I recently finished The Hating Game, and I really didn’t like it at all. I struggled with it the entire time, and overall, I thought it was very unimpressive and tedious. For example, I couldn’t connect with the main characters. I found them both to be lacking depth, complexity, and that special something that makes a character jump off the page for you. Neither Josh nor Lucy were interesting for me to read about. Plus, they were pretty immature and obnoxious, individually and with each other. Also, I know a lot of people love this book for being funny. I didn’t really find the banter and humor to be funny at all??? I honestly think it’s just my personal sense of humor not meshing well with the humor of this book, but I didn’t find the jokes and banter to be funny, witty, or delightful in any way. Also, I couldn’t get into the writing style and Lucy’s internal voice. I found them both to be juvenile and off-putting. The writing lacked a certain... sophistication? that I personally prefer for my books to have. 

Also, the romance wasn’t very memorable or swoon-worthy to me. I couldn’t bring myself to care about the couple at all. I did not feel the chemistry between them for a second, so the scenes of romantic connection and tension totally fell flat to me. I think that’s fundamentally why I couldn’t get into this book—I found it to be super flat, boring, unengaging. It took me, like, two weeks to finish this book, because I just found it to be so dreadfully dull and bland that I had to keep putting it down for days on end. I know this is meant to be a light, fluffy book, but I kind of wish there was more substance and emotions to the story. Also, there were some problematic, obnoxious jokes that poke fun at people with mental illness, people who are fat, and developing countries (if I’m remembering correctly). I perhaps could have been more lenient about these problematic elements if I had enjoyed this book more, but since I found everything to be insufferable, they only exacerbated my dislike of this book. Alas, this was just not the romance book for me. 😕

I will say, though, that the one iconic line that Josh says to Lucy was pretty good but that was pretty much the only thing I can say I liked about this book. 

Is there anyone else here who felt the same as me? I’m kind of convinced I’m the only one who hates this book, so if you also hated it too, please let me know so I don’t feel like a weirdo lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/kb81cx/i_just_read_the_hating_game_and_found_it_to_be/,2020-12-11T18:15:56Z,55,71,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

ev03hj,"The OBNOXIOUSLY obsessive review of Sally Thorne's The Hating Game that nobody asked for, but a bored reader felt compelled to write.","  

Disclaimer: I’ve only gotten into romance novels within the past year or so and I found this subreddit even more recently. Mods – I’ve checked the rules and I don’t believe I’m breaking any, but please let me know if I am and I’d be happy to fix it! Additionally, there are a bunch of spoilers in this review, so read at your own risk. 

The Hating Game by Sally Thorne is one of the most beloved books on this subreddit, the Kindle top reads page, and goodreads. After hearing all the hype about it, I bought it back in November or so and started reading. I made it roughly two chapters in before I had to call it quits. I just put it away, moved on, and didn’t think about it again until I discovered this subreddit and keep seeing people gushing over it at least once every other day. I really began to wonder if maybe I just didn’t give the book a fair shot because there’s no way that 103K+ readers on goodreads could give it an average rating of 4.18 if it sucked as much as I thought it did. So, after a post on here yesterday about it, I decided to start reading it again. 8 hours later, it’s 2AM and I’m exhausted, but also really regretting giving this book a second shot. 

Now, I’d like to clarify something – I am not here to trash the book or shame people for liking it. I really, **really** want to understand how so many people loved this book when it had all of the things that people complain about in romance novels. I’ve sat here and gone through the megathreads that pop up every now and then about “Worst things in romance novels” or “pet peeves about romance plots” and without fail, everything people listed can be found in this book. It took me a while to articulate why I just didn’t like this book so much, but here we go:

**1. HEIGHT IS NOT A PERSONALITY.** 

Lucy mentions that she’s exactly 5 ft tall about once every 1.25 pages. She’s too short to do something, she’s too small to reach something, she’s tiny and petite and Josh is so big and strong and manly and huge. WE GET IT. The obsession with Josh’s height is bordering on objectification at some point. There’s even a scene where Lucy decides that her ex-boyfriend is not as good as Josh because Josh is tall enough to pick her up and her ex wasn’t. WTF? Are we also just going to fake obliviousness at the whole him picking her up while they make out thing? Unless she’s built like a 4-year-old, it’s physically impossible to pick someone up with your arms around their ribcage without squeezing them to death, let alone in a comfortable enough manner to makeout. And in the same vein, please stop with the clichés of how perfectly they fit together. 

**2. Lucy**

This is probably my biggest complaint of the entire book. How many times on here have we talked about how we hate those cliché, and more than mildly insulting, tropes about women in romance novels? They’re too cutesy, they play dumb and oblivious as if they have the intelligence of a five-year-old, they’re “not like other girls,” etc. Lucy is the culmination of all of them. First, there’s the fact that Lucy apparently lives so far in her own head that she thinks Joshua hates her. He flirts with her openly from the very beginning of the book. There’s no backstory or rhyme or reason for why she thinks this. Her hatred and antipathy towards him are so strong that she literally thinks he would harm her when they’re in the elevator together. 

There’s also the fact that her actions are… child-like isn’t the word, more like kids’ cartoon-esque. Think about the paintball scene, where she states, “I wave at Helene like a sad cat *womp womp*.” That was the beginning of some sort of Japanese manga style romance. Josh takes care of her, and apparently, she’s so sick she’s delirious. However, she’s not delirious enough to pass out like any other normal person while she’s sick. No, her special type of delirium causes her to talk and say the most personal things that she would never say while not running a fever. The sick partner trope is used a lot, and I normally love it! But it was poorly executed in this book. And speaking of cartoonish, what the ever-loving hell is up with the scene where she climbs him like a koala and refuses to get off? And he just goes with and does chores!? It wasn’t cute or cheesy or anything remotely close, it was as if she was a fussy newborn in a baby bjorn that mommy had to placate while getting housework done. 

She’s constantly described as “shortcake” – which, okay fine. Maybe the constant mention of her height soured me on this one, the nickname is actually pretty cute. It was the description of her that made me view her as the actual early 2000s cartoon character, [Strawberry Shortcake](https://mpng.pngfly.com/20180528/kbs/kisspng-strawberry-shortcake-muffin-strawberry-pie-small-strawberry-5b0c0f40331da7.0892778215275169922094.jpg) . Which, weirdly enough, is the perfect physical representation of her personality. Once I envisioned her this way, I couldn’t shake the image, which made things all the weirder. 

**3. Josh**

My issues with Josh are far more to the point than my issues with Lucy. They all essentially boil down to the fact that this book has joined the millions that have glorified an exaggeratedly handsome asshole, who verbally and emotionally harasses the female protagonist, to the point where readers are left thinking that men with the emotional range of a teaspoon and communication skills of a poorly trained baboon are irresistible. He goes to the gym in the morning, at night, and during his lunch hour, and yet he doesn’t want to be objectified for his looks. He won’t tell the woman he’s supposedly in love with that he used to date the woman his brother is marrying. He doesn’t actually communicate anything – not even something as simple as, “Hey, did you like the roses? I’m sorry for what I said.” The roses thing had the potential to be a very good turning point in their relationship, but no. He had a decent backstory too. Disapproving father, lived in the shadow of his brother, there was potential for growth there! But instead of growth, we got characters who enabled him. Also, about 60% of the way through the book, I was convinced he was actually taking romance lessons from Joe in the creepy Netflix series, “You”. 

**4. Both of them suck at their jobs.** 

Or you know, maybe they don’t? But we never actually get to find out because it doesn’t seem like either of them actually do any work! I don’t understand how these two still have a job, let alone be up for some big promotion. I know that this normally isn’t the focus of a romance novel, but I need some sort of plot here. Something besides them staring at one another, hating one another, and mauling each other. 

**5. All of the side plots and characters with promise that were abandoned.** 

Who got the promotion? Sure, Josh quit, but there were other candidates! Why mention Val, this weird former friend, so freakin’ much if you’re never going to elaborate? Why bring up her visiting her parents when it never actually comes to fruition? She literally mentions it twice, makes a big deal about it, and they never come up again. It’s almost as if nothing else in Lucy’s life mattered besides sleeping with Joshua – which is a dangerously backwards plot. Also, other characters had absolutely no depth either. Helene, the boss only appeared when it was convenient and just didn’t exist the rest of the time. Lucy also has no friends and neither does Josh. Josh’s mother also had promise, but she turns out to give this lame advice about how Josh is hard to love, but worth it? No, she stayed with a dude who treated her son like shit and is now saying that Josh is the same as him, but it’s somehow great? All while lowkey shitting on Patrick for being “easy to love” as if him being successful, never once judgmental of Josh, and all around a great dude is a bad thing?

**6. The sex. The terrible, awful, vanilla-ass sex.** 

This one could also be me just being over the author’s writing in general, but there weren’t any sparks. The first elevator scene had promise. It was well written, hot when Josh hit the emergency stop, and the kissing game was described well. But, it was just so static after that. The final sex scene alternates between trying too hard to be steamy and being painfully awkward about making it a romantic, love scene. 

All in all, I’m confused. Not on my feelings about the book – clearly, I hated it. There are many things that didn’t even make it onto this list of reasons. I’m confused about what so many people saw in this book – specifically, the people who have voiced how much they hate all of the same things I wrote in this post. I would really love to hear from someone who can explain to me what they liked about the book, because it did have promise. I just thought it was squandered.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/ev03hj/the_obnoxiously_obsessive_review_of_sally_thornes/,2020-01-28T03:51:15Z,75,89,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

Extra points for mmc being wealthy and successful in business without being a spoiled boring billionaire trope. (I am usually so over the rich alphahole thing but this guy and his family are great. )

grxgdr,"The Hating Game, Flatshare, Dirty Martini Running Club... what have y’all done to me?!","Hey romance books community! I had a big slump- and really struggled to get out of “brain mush” territory. So I decided to pop in here and read a few of your top suggestions. Anyway, this past week I read ^ those and yesterday read The Widow of Rose House.  

I really enjoyed them for different reasons! But found that I enjoyed when there were fully fleshed out characters and well developed interpersonal relationships (friends, family, romance).  

Anyway... I would love to hear your recommendations ! 

Since it’s really fresh in my brain, I really enjoyed The Widow of Rose House. I felt like at first it seemed a bit much since I was reading it after The Flatshare and it honestly was a bit heavy to reach another story about abusive exes- but I thought The Widow navigated it well. I enjoyed the fun aspect of the ghost story as well as the inclusion of science, art, and romance! I lived in Paris for a while and really really enjoyed some of the parts talking about Montmartre and love art and history but work in a scientific/government field so it was really fun to see tidbits of all of that. 

I’m interested in reading about strong and smart women and a romantic relationship that is built well as opposed to just being sprung on the reader (me). And really enjoyed the distinct personalities of the heroines I read. 

And preferably a happy ending... I’m sure a lot of us are looking for some sweet and happy romantic endings right now.

hm4e3p,On the hunt for well written contemporary romance (possible spoilers for hating game),"I’ve recently started to read romance books again after a long hiatus but I find it quite hard to sort through all the different books out there! I’ve read the following books (in order of how much I enjoyed):

1. Beach Read- loved it! >!Love the fact that there was more to the story than just the relationship which helped with character growth. Loved that the heroine was complex but her insecurities didn’t drive from her views of her body/looks etc. Hero was good and had his own backstory and dynamic. Also enjoyed that there were other characters and not just the couple in their own world!<

2. You deserve each other- it was a fun dynamic and liked the playfulness mixed with seriousness. >!Wasn’t a fan of some of the outlandish family dynamic bits!<

3. Flat share- was cute book but at times >! I couldn’t understand the strange outfits she was wearing (I know very shallow from me...)!<

4. The hating game- was fun but >!not hugely into the hero’s behaviour being framed as romantic when it’s not. Also, I got it she was short, stop telling me...!<

I enjoy books with heroines who are not hung up on their insecurities when it comes to looks, and heroes who aren’t too dark/engaging in abusive behaviour masquerading as romance.

But when I was reading it, I couldn't shake a thought out of my head... Lucy is clearly a Cancer. Astrologically speaking. I'm really into astrology, and this doesn't happen in all books, but just her general dramatic-ness, the bottling up of feelings and inner freakouts, isolating herself from her family and even friendships at work because she's over-sensitive about comments or self-perception.... Everything about it screamed Cancer to me 

It got me wondering, are you guys into astrology and do you ever imagine astro headcannons for characters? 

Also, do you know any romance novels that have astrology elements? I read one a while ago, Lord Lightning, and sadly the astrology was the most interesting thing about it, the romance bit was kind of blah.

17t9f1u,What are some books that just don’t live up to the hype/personal expectations?,"The Hating Game: I gotta say, the title lives up to the name. Reading this book IS the hating game, and I was just . . . left with too many questions. The whole plot wasn’t even resolved, it just abruptly ended at a hotel. I wanted to know the reactions to their relationship in the work face. The complications, and the crippling reality that it just won’t work, and those beautiful, bittersweet scenes towards the end where they both want each other, but don’t know a way past their obstacles, before the book ends with a dramatic, beautiful reunion where they promise to never let that happen to them again. Finished, but afternoon wasted.


And I thought that was the only book I would ever hate, until I read the next two books in the Hot & Hammered series by Tessa Baliey.

Love Her or Lose Her: Really, the marriage is beyond repair, and I firmly believe that the MC would have been happier leaving her husband. I just can’t excuse being emotionally neglectful of your wife/husband. Honestly was rooting for the divorce. Finished, but only so I could read my most disappointing read that I was so excited for.

Tool of Engagement: I really liked it, I did. But I just cannot continue the book when it is CONSTANTLY being thrown in my face that she is in her early thirties, and he is in his early to mid twenties. AND DON’T GET me STARTED on all the freaking COUGAR jokes. DNF at the start of the smut scene. Nothing like getting it on with your older boss at your place of work, am I right???

And I thought it couldn’t get worse. But it did, and it always does at some time.


Icebreaker: It just felt like ista hate love/ hate sex. The scenes that were supposed to be “hot” (I’m looking at you, Uber scene) just make me feel . . . awkward, and just . . . why? There is little plot, and too much bad smut. But if you want to read a book that is all about the popular party girl in college, go right ahead.

the pining, the yearning, the unrequited love, the misunderstood crushes, the longing... ahhh so many feels. 

i've read: 

- The Hating Game by Sally Thorne 

- The Bronze Horseman by Pallina Simons

- The Highwayman by Kerrigan Byrne (most of the series actually)

- When He Was Wicked by Julia Quinn

- Scandal in Spring by Lisa Kleypas 

- Vicious by LJ Shen

- Be With Me by J Lynn (kinda) 

- Friends Without Benefits by Penny Reid

- Marriage of Inconvenience by Penny Reid

- a lot of Mariana Zapata (Kulti 🥰) 

- Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen of course. Darcy is THE blueprint. 

- Attachments kinda counts

- The Hook Up by Kristen Callihan 

i'm forgetting a lot of them, but these are the highlights 

it can be a surprise (like in The Hating Game or Secrets of a Summer Night) or a thing we know from the start (like in Truth or Beard or When He Was Wicked), i don't really care. i also don't care about whether the heroine likes the hero at first or not (like in Marriage of Inconvenience thet have crushes on each other and in Vicious h thinks H hates her). what i don't enjoy is the heroine being in unrequited love.

15gb6av,Most Impactful Romances of the Past Decade,"Recently listened to this episode of BookRiot's romance podcast and they tried to come up w/ a list of the ""most impactful"" romances of the past ten years. Not the best, not their favorites, but the ones that shaped the genre.

It's a super interesting question and would love to get takes on it.

My thoughts:

1) The Kiss Quotient ** & The Wedding Date both brought new readers to the genre w/ illustrated covers + trade paperback size. They also showed there's an interest for non-white stories.

2) Red, White and Royal Blue for many of the same reasons and the queer representation.

3) Something by Alyssa Cole

4) I'm super bummed to learn the Governess Affair by Courtney Milan was 2012 because I really think the Hairpin scene changed how we depict consent.

jd4do1,Books about the heroine thinking the hero does not like her when he is secretly in love with her,"God, I am so glad I found this sub. Just after half an hour of scrolling, I decided that I would never leave. I have already so many threads of recommendations from you lovely people saved, but I have not found any for my absolutely favorite trope, which is why I'm now asking if you know any romance novels with the trope described in the title. 

Take the Hating Game or Pride and Prejudice, for example. The heroine is completely oblivious to the hero's feelings for her & thinks he hates her. That is my catnip. 

I do not like it when the hero is obviously interested in the heroine and is constantly showering her with flirtatious banter and innuendos. No, I want my men in romance novels absolutely incapable of expressing their feelings in a straightforward manner. The more they struggle or feel like they have to hide their interest, the better. Or even if they are somewhat obvious about their feelings, I want my heroine's skull to be as thick as a concrete wall & I want her to view every action made by the hero as proof of his hatred of her. 

Even though I use the words hero & heroine, I do not mind if the genders are reversed or if it is a same sex romance. I just need more of this trope. Please help me, kind people of the internet!

15fdpol,What is the most original book you’ve read? I need something new! I feel like I’m reading the same story over and over. Loved The Dead Romantics and need some other books to read that have similar vibes!,"Basically the title! I read The Dead Romantics and thought it was unlike any romance book I’ve read recently and I’ve been craving something similar since reading it a few weeks ago. A lot of books are cookie cutter and copy/paste, which is okay and I eat it up sometimes, but I’m getting bored and need something different.  

I don’t read dark romance and can’t read anything with SA unless it’s super vague. I’m down for any genre, but please if it’s enemies to lovers I cannot do that in contemporary but I love it in fantasy romance. It feels really immature to me most of the time if it’s contemporary or rom-com. I started The Hating Game and thought it was cringey af and couldn’t get past the first few pages so nothing like that pls. However rivals to lovers is fine, for some reason it feels different to me than enemies to lovers?  

Others I’ve recently read that I really loved that sort of hits that spot are Half A Soul by Olivia Atwater and The Undertaking of Hart and Mercy by Megan Bannen! If you haven’t read those I highly recommend.  

I’d also love M/F but also a big fan of F/F (where my bisexual baddies at?)!

Okay so I know that slow burns are requested A LOT but I’ve been looking through old posts and I just can’t find anything that’s right for me. 

So I am looking for a super slow burn where they get together near the end. I also need the guy to be a NICE guy!! I’m sick of reading books with possessive alpha males. 

Books I enjoyed:
-Josh and Hazel's Guide to Not Dating (LOVED THIS, my fave!). 

-The Flastshare

-I like some of Mhairi McFarlane’s books. 

-Well Met by Jen DeLuca was alright. 

-The Simple Wild by K.A. Tucker

I quite liked The Hating Game but not really looking for enemies to lovers unless it’s super slow burn and the guy is actually a nice guy.

m6fipu,🗣️ Shout it from the rooftop: romances you love that don’t get enough hype,"We all know those romances that get lots of attention or are frequently recommended in the genre: books like **The Hating Game**, **Bringing Down the Duke**, **Love Lettering**, **The Duchess Deal**, **Beach Read**, etc. It’s often well-deserved, but this thread ain't for books like that!

**Today, I want you to be a one-person hype queen for your lesser-known faves.** What book(s) do you adore that deserve more love? What book unexpectedly knocked your socks off that no one ever talks about? What book makes you yell “YEAH BUT HAVE YOU READ THIS?” as you shove it into someone’s face?

My contribution is the Palace of Rogues series by Julie Anne Long, which currently stands at two books: [Lady Derring Takes a Lover](http://julieannelong.com/internal/books_ladyderring.htm) and [Angel in a Devil’s Arms](http://julieannelong.com/internal/books_julieslatest.htm). These are two of the funniest and sweetest historical romances I’ve ever read. Both books feature found family, a strong and central female friendship between two unlikely women, a hilarious cast of side characters, and sexy, devoted heroes. They don't get recommended enough and so I'm here to hype them up! You’ll laugh, you’ll sigh, you’ll swoon, and you’ll laugh some more. 

I know this has been asked a few times in the past, but it's been a while since I've seen a similar thread and I love the variety threads like this turn up. Now, it's your turn.

I got this in an email from Goodreads today, so I'm sure some of you have already seen it. But if not, it's interesting! Gotta love Valentine's Day season!

Of course, Goodreads does these lists based on USER shelves, and in this case the want-to-read shelves (which is weird?), so there are some in there that people will probably argue are not romance genre specifically (as people always do whenever Goodreads Choice Awards comes around, lol). I'm specifically stoked for my boy Alexis Hall getting Boyfriend Material on the list of most popular when it's only like 7 months old and the list covers three years!

How many have you read? Is your favorite on the list? We could also probably talk about book cover trends here. Lots of pretty ones to look at.

I read ~~14 of these~~ (edit: apparently 17, and realized I never logged 3 books?) and DNF'd 3. A bunch more on on my TBR. My favorites on this list were probably Boyfriend Material, Take a Hint, Dani Brown, Beach Read, and Red, White, and Royal Blue!

Also, LOL at people in the goodreads comments being up in arms that The Hating Game isn't on the list. It's too old for that!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/lg488q/52_most_popular_romance_titles_of_the_last_3/,2021-02-09T14:17:19Z,152,236,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST
ylzlx6,The Best Romances - r/RomanceBooks Wiki Recs Nominations,"**~~Nominations are now open for the r/RomanceBooks Recommendation A to Z Guide!~~**

&nbsp;

##Update: Nominations are closed.

&nbsp;


##What am I talking about?
A few months ago the [r/RomanceBooks Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/wiki/index/) went live and included a fantastic [A to Z Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/wiki/recommendations/a-z/) with top recommendations for the most popular tropes and sub-genres. The original list was sourced by mods from megathreads and popular book request threads. We are going to update this list annually by asking the community for nominations and then holding a sub-wide vote for the best books. 

&nbsp;

##Here are the rules:
**1. Nominate one book per trope/genre.** One book per comment. This is meant to be a list of the very best, so pick your absolute favorite! While you can recommend the same book for multiple categories, please note that a book will only be listed once in the A-Z guide in order to provide a diverse list. 


**2. Include the title, author and relationship.** *For example: ""The Hating Game by Sally Thorne (M/F)"" or ""Glitterland by Alexis Hall (M/M)”.* There is a comment below for each sub-genre and trope listed in our A to Z guide. **Please do not create your own trope/genre parent comments.** Ctrl+F is your friend - please search before adding a book to avoid duplicate nominations!


**3. Upvote other nominations for books you like.** There’s no limit on upvotes, you can upvote as many books as you want. And remember, this is all for fun, so please don't downvote books that you don't like. The most-upvoted books in each category will be selected for our official voting round (to be sent out via survey next week and voting will be limited to top 3 choices per category).


**4. Nominations will be open for one week (Nov 6 - Nov 13).** The nomination thread will be locked at 9am EST Sunday, November 13.

t6os1x,The Range in Enemies to Lovers,"So many people say enemies to lovers is their favorite trope. I never really get a feel for their favorite books though because of the range that comes with the term ""enemies"".

I used to think there were three levels of *enemies* to lovers. I still do I just cannot remember what one of those levels mentally were.

There is the most common one... stuff like The Hating Game by Sally Thorne or maybe From Lukov With Love by Mariana Zapata. Then there is also like straight up going to kill each other enemies. Only book I read like this though is Daughter of The Private King by Tricia Levenseller.

Level 1 or 2: bickering can't get along rivals.

Level 3: adversary genuine hatred with murder possibly on the table

I ve seen this so many times ( the kiss quotient, the hating game etc) and I'm sick of it. The only book i read where the FMC was struggling in her career was you deserve each other by Sarah Hoogle. In this book the FMC feels embarrassed cause her partner earns well as a dentist and she is struggling to get a new job when she has to leave her old job because the store she was working at closed down. This is a very real issue that people have to deal with in this economy. She  doesn't like the idea of being a bit dependent on her partner, however the book doesn't end with her earning the same amount as her partner rather she does find a new job but she just has to accept that they will always be a salary difference between them. However that doesn't mean her partner has more power in the relationship. Sorry i'm rambling the point is i'd love to read more books where the FMC is struggling not just in the romance department but in her career as well. Anyone else feel this way?

Bottomline, I’m looking for recommendations. I don’t really know what I want, but I do know what I *don’t* want—all the red flags (possessiveness, mansplaining, people who can’t grasp the concept the word **no**, to name a few).

Attachments by Rainbow Rowell.
I made it about 25 percent the way in and maybe it's because I'm old, but the dialog and characters just felt very juvenile for there ages. It felt very highschool which isn't a bad thing just not for me. 

Royal by Winter Renshaw
DNF. Did not like the main character and It had a lot of editing issues

The hating game by Sally Thorne
I really really wanted to like this book. It's one of my besties favorites so I felt bad I just couldn't get onto it and I can't even tell you why!? 

I usually read a lot of Historical romances and Billionaires if it's modern so I really wanted to try something different.... I honestly would love an office romance (thats how I met my husband) or old  Acquaintances (enemies/friends doesn't matter) meeting again. Or if anyone just has a favorite CR please tell me!
Duel Pov and Steam a plus!

l8ka2v,"this sub has never let me down, i need a slow burn (enemies to) friends to lovers where we see the first meeting","my favorite trope is probably enemies to friends to lovers but i know that’s very hard to find lol, they don’t HAVE to be enemies it’s just a bonus for me at this point. i NEEED it to be a slow burn too, from both sides so i don’t want the guy to have been pining for the girl for years or anything, i want them to fall slowly in love with each other. my favorites are when the H and h become best friends and kinda toe the line between a relationship and a friendship with the jealousy, the touching and what not. i don’t like childhood best friends tropes, or books where they’re already best friends before the book starts. i’ve also read all mariana zapata books and i personally don’t like HR. i knooow i sound so picky but i’m desperate, if you could suggest anything for me i’ll owe you 

i liked;
the deal (a favorite) 
the wall of winnipeg and me (a favorite)
beard science (love love love this one, a favorite)
the friend zone by kristen callihan (i need exactly that but a slower burn)
josh and hazels guide to not dating (it was nice but wouldn’t call it a favorite)

i disliked:
a girl like you (writing fell flat for me)
before jamaica lane (they were best friends before the book started)
from lukov with love (checked all the boxes but mc was annoying)

I wasn’t sure if it was with him and Evie, if it was my soul in Evie’s body or if it was just me, but it had me waking up pretty hot and bothered. :P

The second one (which was this morning!) featured Josh from The Hating Game. Yeah yeah don’t @ me!

hsl2m8,Hot take: One of the reasons I like to read historical romance novels...,"More than contemporary is because the ""not like other girls"" syndrome is so much less prevalent in historical romances. It's sad because technically, I'm supposed to relate to the ""contemporary environment"" being a modern day woman, but I just...can't.

I'm not saying that there's no ""not like other girls"" or slut shaming behavior in HRs, but it's not as common. Female friendships and bonds I have found are written so much more meaningfully in HRs such as the Wallflower friendships in Lisa Kleypas' novels.

Even books like [A Week to be Wicked](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11738128-a-week-to-be-wicked?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=CtQsJ5ucVv&rank=1) and [When a Scot Ties the Knot](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23587120-when-a-scot-ties-the-knot?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=tGzimAeQGE&rank=1) by Tessa Dare or [Romancing Mr. Bridgerton by Julia Quinn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1859053.Romancing_Mr_Bridgerton?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=f1C9RkcS4a&rank=1), books that have quirky and ""not like other girl"" heroines, they're still written WELL. They're relatable and authors never had the need to put other women down and still endear us to those heroines. 

Heck, I didn't see Charlotte Bronte put women down in [Jane Eyre](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10210.Jane_Eyre?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=zSvIbns9Dn&rank=1), and she's a Victorian era woman bringing to light of a heroine who's ""plain"" but ahead of her time.

This is ironic because one would expect the time period to have more relevant woman shaming than modern day and that is sad. We're supposed to be living in more ""progressive"" times, but the ""not like other girls"" and slut shaming is so much more blatant, abundant and obnoxious in contemporary novels (before I get flamed, I have TRIED countless contemporary romances) and I can only count with one hand all the ones that I actually liked. 

Every time I read contemporary, authors always have to make their heroines more ""different,"" edgy, ""special,"" sparkly, ""virtuous,"" ""unique,"" ""beautiful,"" etc etc than the rest of the female characters. Any background female characters only serve to show how terrible they are and how much more amazing and deserve of love the heroine is. 

One clear example (that I hardly ever see anyone on here or anywhere bring up) is that in [Archer's Voice - Mia Sheridan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32822135-archer-s-voice?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=6QCDumiwDR&rank=1), the heroine dissed a female character who's a stripper/dancer and called her a **""cheap whore""** when she suspected the male lead of sleeping with said stripper. This was never brought up again in the novel and was completely glossed by as an acceptable thing because obviously, strippers who are trying to make a living deserve to be shamed right?

In [The Hating Game - Sally Thorne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25883848-the-hating-game?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=0p9uLGmoht&rank=1), Lucy snidely called a hotel worker ""hotel barbie"" for being blonde, wearing makeup and being attracted to the male lead. She continues to inwardly shame a lot of characters throughout the book and fat-shaming was one of them towards her boss.

Slut and ugly shaming is also terrible in...

[The DUFF](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6931356-the-duff?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=kdERETRUEh&rank=1)

[Painted Faces](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22324795-painted-faces?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=LNqaUz4psS&rank=1) and any LH Cosway novels. 

This tells me SO much about the AUTHORS themselves and how THEY see other women through their heroines and their heroine's words/thoughts.

It got me through a really rough patch, but this year I have struggled to find anything I am actually enjoying (other than A Court of Silver Flames, which is obviously part fantasy. Tbh it was so good I am now in a reading slump)

-Dark-Hunter Series by Sherrilyn Kenyon
-Get a Life, Chloe Brown by Talia Hibbert 
-The Hating Game by Sally Thorne

vdad90,Romances where the MCs have other relationships/careers/plotlines happening OTHER than just the romance.,"So, I've noticed a trend about romances that I *love* beyond all others and that is when there is a plot beyond that of just the main romance.

I love scenes where a FMC spends a lot of time taking care of herself, exercising, being with friends/family (*a la* many of Mariana Zapata's books!) Or, when the FMC has an education or career and we *actually* get scenes where she's in the office or other workplace, discusses work, or - EVEN better! - the plotline has something to do with her job! (*The Hating Game, People We Meet on Vacation, The Soulmate Equation,* even slightly *One True Loves* by Taylor Jenkins Reid with the bookshop she works at\*).\*

\*To be fair, I would also love this in the MMC's point-of-view, I just feel like we mostly get this solely in the FMC's perspective, but both is great!

I feel like this makes romance books so much more realistic, the characters feel so much more well-rounded, and honestly, it just makes the books so much more fun! I love reading about people's routines, getting coffee with friends, just normal every-day stuff. Not 100% sure why!

So, if you have any books that fit under this category at the sub-plot (or even main-plot), revolves around something other than the main romance of the story and we actually get to engage with the friends/family/work/school *on page* (not just in passing or reference), I would love it!!

Also, does this mean that I prefer women's fiction? Because I still want the romance aspect to be there!

s6jyze,"Book where the hero helps the heroine get another guy, but falls in love with her in the process and becomes tortured watching her with someone else?","The title pretty much says it all, but I am basically looking for a novel where the heroine and the hero make a deal where the hero will teach the heroine how to get a guy to like her.

I also love the dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren in Star Wars, I so wish there was a book version of their romance (I did read The Love Hypothesis and loved it!).

I really like MC’s that are morally grey or just straight up villains. “A hero will sacrifice you to save the world, but a villain will sacrifice the world to save you.” That kind of thing. I like for them to be obsessive and secretly in love with the FMC long before she realizes she’s in love with him (but to the reader it’s obvious he loves her). 

By overwrought writing, I mean like Twilight (my #1 favorite series ever). I read a lot of bodice rippers because I like that style of writing. Bonus points if there’s a height difference, FMC is a virgin, they’re destined lovers, or deals with themes of light and dark. 

Some popular books I didn’t like are ACOTAR, Cruel Prince, Throne of Glass (all of which I found too plot heavy/the romances weren’t fleshed out enough), The Wall of Winnipeg and Me, From Lukov with Love, and anything by Colleen Hoover or Christina Lauren (I just don’t like the writing style of those books/authors, it’s missing that *ompf* for me).

szpa5z,Utterly disappointed by The Spanish Love Deception.,"I saw there are several rants about this book in here but I need to make this post anyway to get it out of my system.

Anyway, even though I took forever I actually managed to finish the book.

It had such fun tropes and I saw praise for it on this sub and IG so I pushed myself. But I never really got to enjoy any of the tropes. Most of the first part was just the ML trying to convince the FL for the fake dating scheme so there was barely any fake dating. And there was no banter between the leads so the enemies to lovers thing didn't really pay off either.


The writing was also unnecessarily lengthy and draggy. Like that whole part in chapter 27 about how even one single moment could change your life? I get it, please move on. The FL goes off into tangents in her head which isn't bad but it want funny or interesting. Compare that to say The Hating Game, where the FL had a very funny and unique voice. (FWIW I've not enjoyed THG either but it was slightly better)

And then once they get to Spain, it was so confusing because there were a lot of dialogues in Spanish which again not a bad thing but the translation was given for some dialogues and we were left to figure out the others on our own. I wouldn't have minded if they were consistent with it or given us translation when the context wasn't enough but it followed no reason or rhyme.

Spoilers for the end >!The ML's dad has cancer plotwas weirdly placed and it  reminded me If I Never Met You (which by the way was much better). It was also so rushed and came out of freaking nowhere.!<

>!Also, the break up was so unnecessary. Not to mention, they way the ML dealt with it was so immature. Like if someone had trust issues, why would anyone say ""I can't make you trust me"" and leave? Especially considering the FL's past trauma? Communicate, give her time ffs.!<

>!Also it didn't make sense to me how the FL got over her trust issues at all. Like sure, other people stood up for her but it was brushed off as a minor detail!<

I've also not really understood why no one spoke up about the sexism in the workplace *before* ? I understand thinking that the FL is strong and can handle herself but the ML could have said ""Do you want me to step in?"" and actually asked her if she needed help instead of assuming. 

It's also like the bare minimum? Isn't standing up and confronting other men like one of the first things men are supposed to do?

jwhylw,Do you ever picture the same person in your mind for multiple book characters?,"I don't know if that's the best way to explain that. So for example...

I was reading **Trust (Cafe #3) by Jana Aston** last night and realized that I was picturing the main character Boyd with the exact same voice and face as Joshua from **The Hating Game**. I think it was a mix of the tone of the book and personality of the two characters even more than the physical description. Although that was for sure a factor. #ArmPorn

And then I started thinking if there's any other books I've done with this and yep there sure are. I picture Ben from **Beginners Luck (Chance of a lifetime #1) by Kate Clayborn** and Josh from **The Friend Zone by Abby Jiminez** the same in my head.. right down to the voice I use and everything.

I don't do it as much with female leads because (as a female) I tend to use my own voice in my head for the dialog (unless they have an accent or their voice is described in a certain way) so all my female leads tend to have a common denominator even if the looks are vastly different on paper.

h8i0d7,Hero keeps little things that remind him of the heroine,"Hello everyone! I’m looking for a book, where the hero keeps little things that remind him of the heroine (preferably during the time they are not together yet). The two examples of this that I can think of right now would be The Hating Game - where Josh keeps the note with Lucy’s lipstick on it or the little origami she threw at him - or in You Deserve Each Other - where the hero keeps the straws (I think?) from a restaurant he and the heroine went to with her friends. I know this is a pretty specific request, but scenes with these little trinkets that the hero keeps just melt my heart and are some of my favorites to reread.
I would be really happy to hear any recommendations (preferably not historical romance, unless it’s really amazing).

Ive recently gotten a bit addicted to contemporary romances, specifically those with a enemies to lovers or fake relationships trope. Also enjoy humour, witty banter, hurt/sick caretaking trope and most recently, a celebrity scene. Act like it seems to tick these boxes but I'm balking at the high price of £8 for the ebook, im used to paying about £3 for an ebook, plus this is 1st of a series which means if I get hooked then I will need to buy the rest which are similar priced. (I'm on maternity leave so funds aren't great) can I ask if people honestly thought this was worth the read and price for the tropes I've listed that I liked?

Broody, masculine men who show hints of their feelings with acts of service and support. I like a sprinkle of jealousy and possessiveness.

Big fan of forced proximity (bonus points if it’s a cabin in the woods or survival based).

“By the time you close that wound, the patient will have died of natural causes.”

I don’t care if they’re surgeons but I want them to be in a position of power. Someone I can think of is Adam Carlsen from the Love Hypothesis who was *ruthless* with his students and I really liked the mean comments he made about their work 😂 Someone very dramatic and mean(intellectually) because he expects more from people.

xuoxlo,ML whose love language is being less of an asshole to/around the FL,"Am looking for a specific kind of asshole. Like he’s not a malevolent, abusive villain, just kind of dickish. A little bit of a douche. Maybe he lacks tact or he’s one of those dudes who’s just ALWAYS smug in a somewhat abrasive way. The kind of guy your female friends would go, “Ugh, him? I mean he’s cute but he’s such a douche nozzle.” FL is his polar opposite and a very nice, likable person. She’s probably way out of his league personality wise.

Note: the ML is not an asshole because he’s shy or traumatized (I mean maybe he is, but he’s also still just a jerk). He’s a garden variety, everyday dickhead. His redemption arc is just him not being an asshole to the FL and maybe slightly reining it in around others for her sake.

Maybe he says shit like, “So I can’t call people idiots to their face? Even when they’re being idiots?” Or goes with her to a work function to support her and makes multiple snide comments under his breath about the people there but he’s still present and he keeps her entertained.

Only examples I can think of, sorry:
Late Night - the movie with Mindy Kaling and Emma Thompson where they hint at her getting together with that writer in her office who seemed like a truly epic asshole but actually had a nice side.
Also Roy Kent and Keeley from Ted Lasso kind of fit this trope.

g0p3p8,Why did you DNF a book ? What were the reasons for it ?,"Personally, I DNF a lot of romance, there is so much interesting books to waste your time reading something hat you don't like

\- I wanted to like Penny Reid SO BAD because the plots on the back covers seemed so interesting, but I can't stand the first POV. It make everything seem so cringy to me. I started with the 1st Winston Brother book of the series, but then saw that it was 1st POV. Tried to find other books by her and they're all like that. My heart just broke that day.

&#x200B;

\- *The Hating game* by Sally Thorne. Same things as the Penny Reid books. Tried really hard to like it but the male characters just didn't do the trick for me. No hate please.

\- *If I ever met you* by Mhairi McFarlane : I'm a childfree woman, so I'm not a fan of children in my romances to begin with. But I wanted to try to read this book yesterday and let me tell you, I was not pleased with the premises of the book. First, our heroine really wants a baby. At first I was like ""alright... Well, I can still read this books and see where this is going"" because the book was not too problematic on the 20 first pages. But then, our heroine has a talk with her best friend, explaining why her boyfriend and her broke up. He doesn't want the ""lifescript life"" : no white picked fence, not big house, not marriage, wedding, and most importantly, no baby. Her friend response ? ""Well of course, he's afraid of growing up and responsibilities that's why he doesn't want a baby"" . I stopped right here and there, it made me so mad. I thought I was going to read a smart novel about how sometime you break up with someone because you don't want the same things in life, and that's okay, but the stereotypical pre-made ideas that childfree people are immature and don't have responsibilities just grind my ears.

&#x200B;

\- The Bromance book club series. I was so excited, this books was all a female romance reader could want, right ? Men who read romance. Well, on the 2nd chapter I see that our hero and heroine have kids.

[Here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54189398-the-spanish-love-deception) is a story that satisfies at least one trope for everyone out there... and it’s also on KU for those subscribed. We’ve got some fake relationship, forced proximity, grump & sunshine, enemies to lovers, strong & silent, workplace romance, denied love, & more! All perfectly woven together into such a fun story!

I never want to give away too much, but the gist is a woman needs a date to a wedding, and she ends up striking a deal with her workplace nemesis that leaves her wondering where they‘ll stand when they go back...

I don’t usually like half the tropes that appeared in this book, but it all worked so well here. So fun and fresh feeling to me. This one was a slow burn in my opinion, but I really enjoyed it despite not usually reading that. Lately I have been, and I’m learning that it can be fun in some stories. Similarly, even if one of these tropes isn’t your thing, I urge you to give it a shot if you want to put a smile on your face over some cuteness. Also, it really helped me to read it after reading a very emotional book before it, and I wanted something that just made me feel good. 

I think there’s something for everyone that likes CR in here, but if you need an extra nudge I’ll add that elements in it reminded me of books such as Always Only You, Without Regret, Once Upon a Rose, The Hating Game, Marriage of Inconvenience, Even the Score, & probably more that I can’t think of right now...",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/mef2uo/the_spanish_love_deception_by_elena_armas/,2021-03-27T14:41:52Z,17,58,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

Meet You in the Middle gave me what my anxiety brain needed - cotton candy fluff with predictably gorgeous main characters (beautiful hair, huge penis, abs everywhere, etc) without a lot of depth. The FMC was a bit annoying to me and the MMC was described mostly by how hot he was, rather than any actual personality. Steam factor was maybe a 4/10 for me.

It was sweet an and easy read. The progression was fast, like really fast, unrealistically fast. But, let's be honest, no romance that takes place during Christmas is realistic. I also liked how Audrey's autism was portrayed. The sensory issues, not understanding social ques and the mind games that NT people play, her not being able to lie and her taking everything literally. And I liked how her Autism wasn't ""fixed"" by the end of the story. (I have read so much of those I literally hate it as a ND person.) 

Overall, a sweet story with a *gasp* healthy relationship *and* proper communication?! Anyway, a fast and enjoyable read, can't wait to read the other two books in the series.

Also, thank you u/WardABooks for recommending this to me. Yes, the MMC is a living marshmallow.

P.S I know it's not Christmas anymore, and it would've been perfect when I had read it for Christmas, but I didn't know that this story exited then.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12tn9t8/aita_for_turning_down_an_opportunity_because_it/

And it's because it's almost exactly the same as the plot of {Sugar Daddies by Jade West} with minor changes like ages and the exclusion of the person being in sugar daddy relationship. OP even used the same name for the sister as in the book.

Edit: The reason I posted this here is not some sort of an attack on a poster in another reddit forum. I thought it was interesting and relevant in a forum about romance novels that people are taking the plots of novels and posting them om AITA as if they were original events. I strongly believe this post is a fake based on the quoted section of their post and the actual book.

From OP's post on AITA:

His daughter Verity (24f) was awful.

She treated me like Cinderella most of my life. Always making snide comments about me or my family. Things like:

""Look at my dolls, (OP). All of them, all mine. You don’t have dolls like mine, do you?""

""Look at my ponies (OP). I have three, you don't even have one, do you?""

""Look at my dad (OP). He loves me, not you. Why are you even here, (OP).Nobody likes you here. Nobody wants you here.""

""I hate you, (OP). You’re not my sister. You’re nobody. Just an ugly girl without a proper family.""

Sugar Daddies, pg 191:

""this time there’d be no fancy outfits that would give Verity the upper hand, no special coaches in the wings to up her game and set her out of my league. No special treatment. No biased scholarships. No wad of cash set to raise her to a higher platform. Just us, like for like, waiting for the bell to ring. Round one! My brain raced through the times I’d felt inferior and she’d revelled in it. The posh birthday parties, just for her, even though her birthday was just five days before mine, where I’d been the poor girl, the useless half-sister, the odd one out.

s9uxvl,I guess I’m not in the mood for something else,"So I tried to finish this book I started in October ? Maybe November ? Whatever. I give this book a try and I’m the kind who want to finish a book when I start it. So I didn’t start something else while I did not enjoy my reading either. It was long, it was boring, the plot was not a plot and it was “Eww” Romantic and not “wow 😍” Romantic. 

But 3 months without the magic moments I usually find when I read books, it’s hard. So I decided to DNF this one and went for security : The Hating Game and my life became a lot better. 

And Thank You Oh RomanceBooks community ! You gave me more : The Love Hypothesis (oh God, I want to cry remembering it) , Twice shy (This one. My vibes. My magic moment. Why I love reading. I knew I will love it on chapter 1) , It Happened One Summer (I’m impatiently patiently waiting for #2) and finally The Spanish Love Deception (loved the characters on this one). 

And now, though I love a little action and fantastic worlds, I have this void because I don’t feel like I can read anything else but sweet love stories.

So this long rambling post to say : 1/ Thank you so much for everything you’ve already done, 2/ please help me again here and give me your best recs.

h9pfnw,"Read Folk of the Air and ACOTR series, looking for similar recommendations","First, I want to say I discovered this sub a couple weeks ago and I’m so glad I did! I got back into reading last year pretty heavily. I’ve been reading mostly fantasy, sci-fi, and some classic and fic lit in-between. 

I read the Hating Game(love) since being on this sub and the two said series. 

When I started Folk, I wasn’t sure what I would think because I have never read fantasy books that had to do with Fae. I’m surprised at how accepting I was to the sex scene with Cardan where he coiled his tail around her leg (raised eyebrows🧐) but I truly enjoyed the romance scenes and loved the series as a whole. 

The day I started Roses, I read a review on goodreads relating it to Beauty and the Beast and I honestly wished I had not. I had the hardest time with Tamlin because I could not stop picturing him as the Beast from the disney movie and his voice! Every sentence I read from him was the disney Beast in my head 😂 The sex scenes, although very hot, were especially hard to imagine cause I had to focus really hard on not picturing the Beast with Feyre. Pushing through that, I loved the series especially Feyre and Rhysand’s relationship. 

Anyways, I’m hoping to find similar romance novels! Some erotica doesn’t bother me as long as it’s written well and holds decent substance. 

Any recommendations would be appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/h9pfnw/read_folk_of_the_air_and_acotr_series_looking_for/,2020-06-15T21:35:28Z,14,25,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

I'm looking for something that captures that sentiment; the angst and self hatred and torment that makes the MC (M or F) seem cold and distant and even sometimes cruel.

18l1s90,Just finished The Worst Guy by Kate Canterbary...,"SPOILERS ABOUT {The Worst Guy by Kate Canterbary}, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! Also, hope the flair is correct.

So, I've just gotten into reading again after abandoning it during my teenage years. I read {The Sixty-Forty Rule by Ellie K. Wilde} in TWO DAYS, devoured it, loved it.

Trying to find something similar many people suggested The Worst Guy, so I picked it up. 

I hated it. It took me a month to finish it, and I had to force myself to finish it because having DNFs so early in the game seemed like a defeat. But yeah, it was dreadful.

My main points of critique were:
- the FMC is so annoying. She calls herself a pick me and SHE IS. She's constantly complaining about not wanting to be the center of attention and then goes out of her way to BE the center of attention. E.g. she doesn't want people to know she has an eating disorder but she will have a baggy of croutons or trail mix with her at all times. Like girl, of course people are gonna ask you if that's all you're eating for lunch if you eat that in front of them. They're concerned for your health. It seemed like she was trying to be quirky while complaining about people thinking that she was different. Like that person on facebook who posts a photo at the hospital and then doesn't want to tell why they're there. She's also straight up mean and unsufferable, while he's just bantering.
- the FMC concern about her father's reputation preceding her never really plays out, but she talks about it constantly. Girl we get it, you hate your father,  big deal, literally no one is mentioning him (happens once in the entire book, towards the end).
- the FMC giving the MMC a hard time for something that was out of his control (she threw a tantrum and destroyed a room, and then was upset because the MMC had virtually no consequences while she had a formal reprimand, and somehow he was in the fault???). And for this same reason, she decides that it's a good idea to have him wait for her response for 2 weeks after he poured his heart out to her, inflicting additional unnecessary pain in the meantime too (he asks to only come to him when she'd had made up her mind, and of course she visits him when she still hasn't got a response for him). Towards the end the reader finds out that she was only waiting after Thursday, the day of the week when they would meet to have sex, to break the cycle. So basically, she's always known what she was going to answer, she just wanted to see him suffer I guess. Total carelessness for his feelings. Oh and she only decides to go talk to him after she hears him talking great about her to someone asking him his opinion on her. Like, that's what prompted her to go speak with him.
- the sickness trope doesn't usually bother me but here it was very poorly executed. She's avoiding him but somehow also checking up on him and by chance she notices he's not at work, and by chance she finds his co-worker who by chance tells her he was having a migraine. By chance her best friend had a copy of the key of his apartment. By chance he was home, of course, and by chance she knew (I mean, he could've been at the pharmacy? At the store? Like, I get that he was sick but she had no way to know if he was actually home). Also, she keeps repeating that she's doing it because he did the same for her, which is reasonable but not... nice? I don't know, I get it but it also sounded like she was paying a debt.
- as you can see, my main critique is definitely the FMC as a whole, but if I can add just one more thing... some of the spicy talks were just cringy as hell. I love spicy talking, I really do. Give me filthy, give me praise, give me scolding, give me anything but stupid nicknames (demon pussy magic, screech owl) and dumb topics (nerdy t-shirts) and long ass speeches that would never happen in real life and even more unnatural responses. None of these would have been an issue if they weren't mentioned / done during sex. 

I'm sorry for my long ass rant. I've reached a point where I'm thinking ""Sebastian please leave her I could make you happier"" just because I dislike this FMC so much.

x17fnm,I really enjoyed Love on the Brain by Ali Hazelwood. But it felt unfinished. It looked unfinished too.,"I liked the plot. I liked the twist (I was told it's bad, predictable, the same as the first one— um those people are crazy none if that is true). I liked Levi and I liked Bee. The side characters were good. I really loved the book.

But a weird thing happened twice... so this book is from Bee's POV right? Well I had a long paragraph that was actually third person. Was so hard to read because there is a line in it that is first person. But the rest is third. And to make matters weirder, that kinda happened twice. But the second time was Levi's POV. I don't know what to say about this.

Another thing, random pages had different fonts. These mistakes happen okay, happens all the time. I'm not sure if it felt like more than usual because it was more than usual or because of the other issues.

What happened with Annie? Did I skip that ending because I didn't thoroughly read the epilogue, I don't like epilogues. But in the Author's note she says the book is a love letter to [lists a ton of things in her book] friendships that hit a rough patch then bounce back. Did Annie and Bree bounce back? Missing this could totally be on me but it adds to my confusion.

Levi's convo with Sam. So Levi told Bee she missed the convo and must have left dight after. But never tells Bee what it was that he said after she stormed away? We never got that answer right? I mean obviously it is the fact that he can't work with her because he is in love with her, but like come on, you gotta tell her that. I kept waiting for that moment like in TLH where Olive found out Adam always knew her. Or in The Hating Game, where Lucy finds out he actually quit when he spoke with their boss. Idk I missed this moment.

Did we find out exactly what Levi said to Tim? They collaborated for a while, Tom was lying the whole time and we aren't gonna discuss it?

**I loved this book but was it rushed or something? It's skewing with my rating I don't know what to give it. The random mistakes were odd.** Did I get a bad copy or something? There are def more mistakes than what I listed but I can't put my finger on them now that I finished.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/x17fnm/i_really_enjoyed_love_on_the_brain_by_ali/,2022-08-30T02:38:32Z,7,10,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST
156lekl,"Musings about the ""Not Like The Other Girls"" hate","Hi, all!

I'll start by saying that I, too, very much dislike when MFC are written as ""special"". I'm pretty feminist, and I believe, like many of us, that it's insulting AF and sounds a lot like internalized misogyny.

HOWEVER. In reviews or comments, I often noticed that if the FMC is written as dressing in a somewhat ""quirky"" way, if she likes video games, if she's clumsy, if she's babbling, or if she had other ""non traditional"" female interests, she gets branded as being one of these Not Like Other Girls Type. And don't get me wrong here: I'm not talking of MMCs that blatantly say ""oh, you're not like other girls"" or FMCs that see themselves as ""special"". I'm talking of how the character is described, plainly.

And... I'd like to make a case here. I got diagnosed with ADHD as a child (I'm now 31), which was a rare enough case for little girls in the late 90s. I'm kind of a poster child for the diagnosis, and there is nothing glamourous about it. Nothing endearingly quirky. All I always wanted was to fit in and BE one of the girls. I am extremely clumsy, cannot play any sports that ask me for coordination to save my life (I've never been able to play friggin' badminton), I talk fast, my interests are all over the place, and I've been medicated for a panic and anxiety disorder since I was 9... And this is the short version. My fashion sense (or lack of I guess), which I don't consider to be linked to my diagnoses, is very colorful (bright colors attract me to no end), and men have called me quirky to my face more than once. 

I enjoy all romances with all types of FMCs and MMCs. As an example, Elle Woods is a favorite pop culture icon of mine, and yet I can't name a character I have least in common with than her. But reading a romance where the FMCs reads a bit like me, and even more so now that we have characters with neurodiversity diagnosis, it feels like I'm seen. It feels like I'm one of the girls. Which is what I've always wanted to be. My best friend has little in common with me, and she's one of my favorite humans out there. There is so much beauty in celebrating our differences as humans, I find. 

And I know I shouldn't take it personal when I read reviews or comments critizing these characters because the author is ""trying too hard to make them QuIrKy or NoT oNe oF thE gIrLs"". I know that. But it still does, because some of us are like these characters, but we WANT to be one of the girls. I love reading characters that wear weird colorful clothes or quirky earrings; I relate to that. It's a sense of belonging. 

I realize that this post is probably too long for nothing, but I'm on my period and feeling emotional lol. 

My point is: there's a nuance to be made between a character that clearly sees herself as superior to other girls and a character that is described as what is often branded as quirky. Now, it may be that these characters are not your cup of tea anyways, which is fair! But yeah. Thats the point I wanted to make this morning. Happy Saturday 🫶🏼.

EDIT: YOU GUYS ❤️😭. I have read all of your comments, and you all made such great and valid points. I'd like to note that I also noticed that the Ice Queen and ""bitchy"" characters get a lot of hate, but that's another one that, when done well, can be some of the greatest FMCs out there.

op6dew,The Ex-talk - fun comtemprary romance!,"I always love a good romcom and haven't found something I like until this book!

{The ex-talk}

**Blurb from Goodread**

Public radio co-hosts navigate mixed signals in Rachel Lynn Solomon's sparkling romantic comedy debut.

Shay Goldstein has been a producer at her Seattle public radio station for nearly a decade, and she can't imagine working anywhere else. But lately it's been a constant clash between her and her newest colleague, Dominic Yun, who's fresh off a journalism master's program and convinced he knows everything about public radio.

When the struggling station needs a new concept, Shay proposes a show that her boss green-lights with excitement. On The Ex Talk, two exes will deliver relationship advice live, on air. Their boss decides Shay and Dominic are the perfect co-hosts, given how much they already despise each other. Neither loves the idea of lying to listeners, but it's this or unemployment. Their audience gets invested fast, and it's not long before The Ex Talk becomes a must-listen in Seattle and climbs podcast charts.

As the show gets bigger, so does their deception, especially when Shay and Dominic start to fall for each other. In an industry that values truth, getting caught could mean the end of more than just their careers...

**Tropes**: office romance, faked relationship, a bit of ""enemies to lovers""

**Why it is a good read?**

* The setting! I love reading about people behind a radio show / doing podcasts.
* Interacial relationship:  Dominic is Korean by background and it is important for his character and the relationship. I wish this were explored in more details though!
* Relatable characters: Both the main leads are lovely and down to earth
* Good chemistry, sexual tension and steam
* Funny writing with outrageous plot point at times, which makes me love romcom!

Overall, it is a great entertaining read! I think it will be your cup of tea if you like The hating game / Love letters / The flatshare (like me).",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/op6dew/the_extalk_fun_comtemprary_romance/,2021-07-22T04:10:37Z,3,16,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST
lwsfql,Help! I’m falling out of love with the genre and I need to be wooed again,"For some time now, I just had a reading streak of rather bleak romances. I DNFed a lot of things because I just wasn’t feeling it. But the worst thing was that I stayed with some stories even if I started resenting certain aspects of them. All this falling out of love with the genre might’ve happened because I started with the best in the first place. 
_x000D_
First, there was Shadow And Bone by Leigh Bardugo. I haven’t touched a romance book in years but somehow I got hooked with this one. What I loved about it is how it built false expectations then broke my heart. It was, perversely, an enjoyable read.
_x000D_
Then I heard ACOTAR was the sh#t and the MMC switch got me so good that I delved further and further into my bookscapade. 
_x000D_
A bit after that, I devoured From Blood And Ash and The Bargainer. Both held a good grip on my NA fantasy fixation. The first slowly peeled the layers of its fantastic worldbuilding then mixed in a strained, angsty relationship that kept me on my toes, not always in a good way, while the second started out strong and only increased its hold with the angst woven in. 
_x000D_
Soon after, I discovered Grace Draven, with her Wraith Kings (and other books, but mostly, it was Radiance with its sweet story of biologically different, sweet people falling in love) and Holly Black's The Folk of Air. (a tense, survival story with some twisted romance mixed in)
_x000D_
I suppose, after reading The Winter King by C.L. Wilson did I finally consider delving into contemporary romance. This book was such a treat with its premise (even if falling short towards the end) but it led me to the spectacular The Hating Game, Well Met, Beach Read and You Deserve Each Other. Also, as you may have assumed, led me to this sub where these are the top recommendations. Followed by Love Lettering (Kate Clayborn), The Simple Wild (K.A. Tucker), After We Fall (Melanie Harlow), Sustained (Emma Chase) and Unbreak My Heart (Nicole Jacquelyn). Then If I Never Met You (Mhairi McFarlane), The Flatshare (Beth O'Leary), Wallbanger (Alice Clayton), Love According To Science (Claire Kingsley), Tangled (Emma Chase), Shortcake (Lucy Watson) and a couple of others, some becoming less memorable for one reason or the other.
_x000D_
I may have reached the bottom of depravity (all in good sense!) with Planet of Desire series by Robin Lovett. (Seriously, I loved these books.) I tapped the tag of BDSM in Something Borrowed by Eve Dangerfield afterwards and now I finished What Price Paradise by Katherine Allred (all in all, the book was 15 years old but had a triple S quality to it with some angst towards the end, which I loved)._x000D_
_x000D_
As you can see, it was a binge read full of interesting premises and I fear, as a newbie, I may have been spoiled. Most of these stories featured strong chemistry between MCs, some true angst to their love and what I assumed was mostly original writing (aside from considerable lengths and sheating swords).
_x000D_
I love the “social” in romance so much, some kind of relatable vision of situations where humans err and try to live through it. But I also love the path the characters take to each other, sometimes urgent, unexpected and clumsy, or long and arduous. I don’t even know what I’m looking for anymore. I just want to be surprised again. If anyone feels like there is a book that is much more than a cover and a blurb, I’d like to give it a chance. Set me up! Please. Thank you all.

I write to you of this burning need in my heart at 4:30am, (after awakening with the idea of this post at 2am). 

I know you guys have generous hearts in there. Please try it out for me and recommend something as funny?... I’ll love you forever and ever. ❤️ (Or simply acknowledge my plight, I’ll eat it up with gratitude like a sad, lonely little puppy dog 😞) 

Please?

Please please please please please?

Pretty please with a cherry on top? 🍒 

(Prostrates self before thee) 

Link to book: [What Happens in London](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5500109-what-happens-in-london?from_search=true&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;from_srp=MYqHSalAkW&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1)

So far the only book I’ve been able to find with kinda the same sort of humor style is [The Autumn Duke ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51260711-the-autumn-duke) by Jillian Eaton. And some ever so brief humorous fragments of other JQ books here and there. (LK too to a very small extent). Whereas What Happens in London has me laughing *almost throughout.*

I’ve read Tessa Dare’s Goddess of the Hunt and Wallflower Wager (which the latter is said to beat all in Tessa Dare’s humor department?). 

Basically, for me, What Happens in London was like the Goat Scene over and over and over again. 

*Let that sink in.* 

Glad you understand. 

Thank you so much for your time lovelies. 😘

(The moment I’m done with the romance I just started, Storm Winds, I’m hopping right on the recommendations! But beware I naturally pay more heed to ones which come from people who’ve read What Happens in London in comparison. I can’t help my bias).

Taking all genres. (Even non-romance is alright if you feel I should know about it)

Edit: I would like to say, the WHiL kind humor is a silly kind of humor I think, and a mockery of British high society.

Edit: I also wanted to say, PLEASE don’t be nervous about recommending or think that it might not live up to my expectations. Lay ‘em on me.

Edit: Will begin with [First Comes Scandal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42874513-first-comes-scandal#) by JQ and update you all. - I decided to try an audiobook which I never do, and realized that JQs humor doesn’t translate very well in audiobook format. But I’ve had some chuckles/smiles and one hearty laugh so far. At ch. 6. I still have 7 more hrs to go! 😥 god I had no idea audiobooks were this slow

Edit: if you would be so kind, please let me know if you’ve read WHiL before recommending. I’m open to trying all, but just need to know 😁

Edit: OK it’s settled. You guys are fucking amazing. This sub is fucking amazing. Love you guys🤘 thank you in advance for all the people trying it out. Don’t want crowd the comment section with my thank you’s.

Edit: for the CRs recs, thank you for those! I’ll try them when I’ve exhausted a few HRs. Thanks in advance!

yvvva8,Romance books where the hero does not like the heroine at first or is disinterested in her etc and then falls in love,"I do NOT want a book where the hero is instantly in love/lust with the heroine. 

What I am hoping for is like a mild slow burn (nothing too agonising) maybe even enemies to lovers where the guy doesn’t like the heroine at first, or is slightly mean too her (nothing too toxic or anything), maybe he is just disinterested or pretends to be disinterested. I also wouldn’t mind if us, the readers feel unsure of the hero’s motives as first with us wondering does he, he does he not like heroine etc (not a must just pushing that out there). 

As I said hero could be disinterested, maybe has some weird misconception about her that is proven wrong that’s why he dislikes her at first. And then of course I want that disinterest or dislike to turn into love! I’d like a more gradual build up to it rather than just some instantaneous insta lust/love. Some pining and angst or some kind of drama would be fun. Also by love I mean I also want to witness the hero’s change from dislike/disinterest to LOVE. 

No immature playboys is my only preference, I like older more mature men who have their life priorities sorted out and aren’t afraid of commitment just because they love to f*ck around with diff women. I also love alpha jealous/possessive men too. 

I want him to be grumpy, cold, disinterested and maybe even mean at first. Thank you lol. But not in like a toxic bully way.

rhm0hi,I just finished the Unhoneymooners and wow…I’m so sad I hate it,"I was SO excited for this book because of the hype. The first half of the book was entertaining but wow the second half just ruined the series for me. Just to be clear, no hate to those that loved it all, but I just can’t get over some of the things that went down. 

Spoiler alert 
The way Ethan handled like….everything? Once Olive tells him Dane was 100% cheating on her sister, he’s like you don’t know for sure, just let it go!?!??? As if she should just ignore the possibility that her sister’s husband has been cheating for the majority of the relationship?? 
And the way he makes the comment about how Dane told him that Olive was just a bitter person and he “didn’t see anything to contradict that” like…wow.
The ending too, I feel like he barely apologized for all his behaviour and she just forgave him right away. 
Not to mention, Dane propositions Olive, and Ethan gets mad at HER because she is ‘bitter’ and breaks up with her. 
Cheating is a HARD pass for me in books, so the way he was just so blasé about the possibility of it being true ruined his character for me. Now I get why people do like this book, there were some really cute moments!!! But when I finished reading it I was just like, what in the gaslighting did I just read!?

oerwbn,"Contemporary romance recommendations needed for a genre-newbie: explicit content, well-written characters and cheesy tropes: books similar to The Spanish Love Deception","First, I'm completely new to the romance genre. I actually considered myself a romance-hater and made fun of my mom loving rom-coms and cheesy movies... well I was wrong \^\^

Anyways, I finished reading the spanish love deception by Elena Armas and god I loved it! If this is contemporary romance, consider me a romance lover! I bought it on a wim and I regret nothing!

&#x200B;

Now thinking more closely, I probably have been a romance lover all along. I used to read fantasy and after some time I only read fanatsy if there was some form of romance going on. Also, I've read many rom-com fanfictions and I've always enjoyed them... Lately, I have also stumbled over the fantasy romance with explicit content genre (like From Blood and Ash, Bridge Kindom... my favorite book ever being A court of Mist and Fury) and I'm in love!

Still, some of the fanatsy romance I've read lack the well-written characters and a slow developing romance that is believable and makes sense. And because The Spanish Love Deception did this so well, I think that Contemporary Romance could be a genre worth exploring.

Anyway, I need some contemporary romance recommendations to fill this void the Spanish Love Deception created. Naturally, I checked out this sub, but couldn't quite find something that fit my bill completely. For example: the Unhoneymooners by Christina Lauren would fit the bill but as I've read in other subs it has no explicit content...

**What I need**

* Tropes: I love the enemies to lovers, sharing same bed, mutual pinning, body guard, fake relationship, forced proximity and so on. Give me all the cheesy and predictable tropes!
* Also slow burn: I'm not a fan of love at first sight. I need the story to be believable and love at first sight always lets me down. Lust at first sight is great as long as there is some form of slow burn/love-development going on.
* Explicit sexy scenes: I need those, I'm not a fan of fade to black, without the sexy scenes the book lacks something for me...
* Explicit but not porn: Again I need some explicit sexy scenes, but when they turn weird and remind me of a very bad prn, I just feel lost. TBH The Spanish Love Deception kind of pushed it with >!the MMC going on about how wet for him the FMC is...!< That kind of talk did not fit the way the MMC talked before so it turned me off... So, when the well-written character suddenly turns into a prn star just because it's a sexy scene, I'm lost...
* Also there needs to be consent!
* as well as an HEA... I cannot handle a sad ending, I'm weak \^\^
* and most importantly well-written characters that feel like real people.

&#x200B;

What's on my TBR that could fit my list is:

* The Hating Game by Sally Thorne
* Radiance by Grace Draven (although this is fantasy romance)

&#x200B;

Do you know anything that would fit with my list? Thank you, you are the best! <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/oerwbn/contemporary_romance_recommendations_needed_for_a/,2021-07-06T10:01:21Z,26,21,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST
movjp5,MMC that’s playful and sarcastic on the surface but he’s actually a whole demon(figuratively)/ antihero,"We love the dark brooding Hero that has the whole “don’t mess with me” vibe and people cower in his presence, but what about those that hide their insidious character beneath sarcasm and playful behavior. They’re the “he never takes anything seriously” character on the surface but he’s  conniving and ruthless beneath it all. The “terrifying” characters fear him and Heroine accidentally uncovers his true nature. So prey/predator relationship between MMCs🤨 and she goes from being terrified of him to fighting him (enemies)——>to loving him. Basically, MMC has a playful air about him but he’s actually the villain. A whole lot of mental games (witty main characters are my favorite!!) 

or even this;;; MMC and FMC hate each other. They’re two powerful people and they’re playing a game of chess irl (only the two of them are aware so on the surface people are oblivious to the animosity that exists between them. 

Instead of “I’ll carve their heart out” it’s “I’ll make sure they lose everything and eat dinner with the rats” ya feel 🤣🤣

Also no smut centric 😭😭🤚 it doesn’t have to be Pg (please hell no) but also no sex scenes every two chapters. I want it to be about their relationship development as they go through the motions (the betrayal, hatred, trying to get to the “real” them” and overcoming their differences and the sexual tension 👀👀👀👀)!

If this doesn’t exist someone write it 😂 but if it does I’ll give you my kidneys (all you need to do is drop a Rec list)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/movjp5/mmc_thats_playful_and_sarcastic_on_the_surface/,2021-04-11T17:51:17Z,48,160,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST
11z5xqn,Enemies to lovers with a good girl and a bad boy - but the bad boy isn’t rich/popular,"So whenever I see the enemies to lovers trope featuring a bad boy character the bad boy is always rich and popular and well off. And it’s like sir you have no reason to be the this angsty! But I love a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Maybe money is a problem for him and he always gets into fights. Life has been tough on him. I love love contemporary romance and tend to avoid anything historical.

voeh2n,I'm searching for MMCs like Mr Darcy in the 2005 movie,"I want a guy who is absolutely, completely in love with the FMC, but too shy/awkward/proud to show her properly. And she, of course , thinks he's stuck up and an asshole so she doesn't understand all of his attempts to show her how much he's in love. There should be sexual tension (I like steam) which the FMC doesn't understand/finds annoying or something like that.

I've searched through the sub and the only interesting (for me) rec I could find was by Mary Balogh and I'm not entirely sure about that one (forgot the title, sorry).

The love hypothesis would fit this dynamic imo and I enjoyed the book, but I would like the FMC to be more confident.

I'm open to everything except Dark Romance and anything non con is also out.

And also after I finally watched Pride and Prejudice for the first time, I know why all the MMCs are tall, dark haired and have blue eyes. They're Mr Darcy. All of them. Maybe not their personality, but I'm pretty sure, you can just imagine Colin Firth or Matthew MacFadyen for 90% of them lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/voeh2n/im_searching_for_mmcs_like_mr_darcy_in_the_2005/,2022-06-30T17:53:39Z,45,43,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

jl5vqn,Book with realistic story and sex scenes? + a bit of a discusion at the end,"Any good romance books out there with the following please?

&#x200B;

\- single POV (please please please, I hate when they switch them) I want to keep guessing what the other side thinks

\- not SUPER EXTRA HOT ALPHA MALE (I hate when a girl says NO and he doesn't respect it because ""deep down she wants me"", or when he laughs in a ""you lie that you don't fancy me"" kind of way)

\- no ""oh my good his penis is so big"" scene - I'm sick of it, can a girl have a hot sex scene with normal-size guy? (or just don't mention in in a description - no huge bulb in his trousers please)

\- and maybe I'm asking to much but if it has to be sexually explicit (which I don't mind - i like it even), can he please not be this super awesome orgasm maker that immediately knows how to make the girl ticks and she ""never had orgasm this awesome before"" - like c'mon, be real a little - sex is supposed to be about exploration not going down on her (yay, she comes), the pump a little and she is done for again all while him being the best...

\- last one is no big love proclamation and asking to marry after two moths  (even though it's not that big of a deal as the other points, it just makes me roll my eyes at the end of the book)

There are some other cliches (they both come at the same time like OMG, gimme a break or some real bulls\*\*\* story about why they are stuck together someplace - don't get me wrong, I like when they do story-wise, but sometimes the explanation just gets way out of real life) but I don't want to be to picky. Am I?

 I love slow-burn, I love enemies to lovers or friends to lovers. I love broody male heroes that are misunderstood. I love those looks that are first misunderstood and then later full of unresolved tension. I like fantasy (ACOTAR - oh my Rhyssand, FEVER series or Cruel prince series), or basic romance books (Hating game, beach read, unhoneymooners and so on...).

&#x200B;

So, any tips for me? :) Are there any hidden gems I missed?

&#x200B;

Am I the only one who's sick of those cliches? I used to really enjoy those kind of books before, but lately it seems that it's everywhere i look and it just makes me lose interest in the story. To be honest, it's mostly because of those sex scenes, I know sex can be amazing even when it's for the first time, but where is the fun in it if the guy already rocks your world and know all your senstive spots..",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/jl5vqn/book_with_realistic_story_and_sex_scenes_a_bit_of/,2020-10-30T21:41:35Z,21,23,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST
15z407v,Adult Dystopian: the futuristic government type,"I've read my fair share of YA dystopian as a teenager, but that shit gets old after you hit your 20s. I'm not a hater of YA and I respect the authors and readers of the genre, I just can't relate to it anymore. There's too much adolescent drama, lack of communication skills and A LOT of love triangles (which I hate).

But, I'm also looking for something similar to Hunger Games, Shatter me and An Amber in The Ashes. I love the idea of the first two of a controlling government after a world wide catastrophe, how people resorted to extreme means of survival and the theme of a world-order forced by means of violence by the government. The third one I mentioned was fantastic due to it's storytelling, which is also something I found lacking in some YA dystopian books (Divergent, Shatter Me, Matched series, etc)

I'm looking for something very romantic, with a great storytelling and rich writing style. Bonus points for steam, but I don't require it at all, and I would prefer no bdsm or forbidden romance. 

Any pairing is fine as long as it features just two people. 

My TW are: other woman/man, cheating, body shaming, slut shaming, love triangle, non-con/dub-con and non-hea (HFN doesn't work for me either).",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/15z407v/adult_dystopian_the_futuristic_government_type/,2023-08-23T13:30:26Z,9,19,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST
17t4ure,The Twisted series by Ana Huang is such a… mixed bag?,"(Unmarked spoilers ahead)

My ranking and ratings for each book:
- Twisted Games 4.5/5
- Twisted Lies 4/5
- Twisted Hate 3.5/5
- Twisted Love 3.5/5

Overall, I’d say the series sits at around a 3.5-4 star rating for me. I enjoyed it a lot, which I feel is important to get across. I’ve seen a lot of critique of it on here and a lot of it is very valid, but I just want to say that I think a lot of it comes down to different tastes in what you like («Crawl to me» scene in Twisted Games is a good example). That being said…

Oh boy. So Twisted Love is definitely the weakest in the series. And for good reason. An issue that haunts the whole series but is particularly bothersome and prevelant in Twisted Love and Twisted Lies is how money=superpowers. I get you need some suspension of disbelief in these books when you’re reading about billionares, but some of this stuff is ridiculous. Alex has a whole crew to pretend to be police officers and the ability to bury news of a housefire? Really? 
The two plottwists in the book were a lot too. The thing with Ava’s father I can accept, but the thing with Alex’s uncle felt almost comical. He murdered a whole family because some girl wouldn’t go out with him? And then just didn’t bother with the kid? Okay..? 
The thing that happens after the kidnapping is also ridiculous. Ava leaves for London and Alex follows her. For a year. A whole YEAR. They weren’t even together for anywhere close to a year!! And he just stalks after her the whole time like a lovesick puppy, it’s pathetic, not sweet or cute. 
However, overall a decent read imo (helped by how short it is), good enough that I read the rest of the series. 

Twisted Games is my favourite, personally. It still suffers from some of the same issues. *Too many coincidences and cringe moments*. You’re telling me Rhys’s real father is the Speaker of the Eldoran Parliament and his brother is Bridget’s cousin? Wow, small world huh? Aside from that, all I can really find wrong is that there are some cringey/unrealistic lines. At one point Rhys says «I know 79 ways to kill a man and I can make 70 of them look like an accident»🙄 But aside from that, I loved this book a lot. Also Rhys is a lot better than any of the other MMCs imo. 

Twisted Hate is a doozy. I like that the MMC is slightly different, even if he still behaves very similarly. The sheer hatred shared between Jules and Josh is an interesting dynamic to explore, even if the reasons for that hatred seems a little lacking. Two big things bother me with this book. 1. Jules being super reluctant to tell anyone about Max feels a little convenient. I get it, the shame is a lot to deal with, but she should know better than anyone her friends won’t judge. Had she told Ava and Alex early on, then Alex could’ve used his magic money superpowers to deal with Max (which is what Christian did anyways, conveniently *after* she stole Josh’s painting). 
Speaking of Josh, 2. Holy shit the scene where Jules returns the painting is some of the most fucked shit I’ve ever read. I haaaaaate when characters have sex after a heated or emotional scene, it just feels all wrong to me. And I thought Josh actually forgave her given all the shit she’s been through, but nope, he lied. And he PINCHES HER CLIT!? And then YELLS at her to get out!? What the actual fuck?? This feels as close to SA you can get without it technically being SA it’s so icky. Why not just remove the sex scene entirely? Have Josh get emotional and yell at her and be all hurt for a chapter or two before he realises he fucked up. What’s the POINT of them having sex?? I liked the book, but those two things dragged it down a lot for me. 

Twisted Lies takes magic money super powers to another level. Somehow, Christian can hack into people’s bank accounts for fun and drain their accounts, use remote hacking devices that make zero sense, and a whole lot more. It just makes no sense and feels way too unrealistic. 
I enjoyed the stalker plot a lot. I’ve never been in that sort of situation so I can’t speak to how realistic it is, but it felt realistic when I read it. I only wish that when Stella was kidnapped, that it would go on for longer. Not even five minutes pass between her waking up and her escaping. I just wish we could’ve seen more of Julian’s twisted mind and I can’t lie, her escape would’ve been a lot more satisfying had she been in danger for longer. 
So, Christian’s «lie»… feels underwhelming. It’s built up as this huge secret that Stella can never know about, but when it’s revealed it feels meh. Like yeah it was fucked up and weird, but clearly not this relationship-wrecking lie that it’s hinted towards being.
Overall though I enjoyed this book. The epilogue particularly was very satisfying and a nice way to tie up the series. 

So I enjoyed the series, but I could talk for hours about its issues. One issue I haven’t mentioned is the length. 
- Twisted Love 350p
- Twisted Games 400p
- Twisted Hate 500p
- Twisted Lies 550p 
Ana Huang really got carried away with the length of those latter novels. A lot could’ve been cut from the last two and it would’ve been a lot better. 

Some of the MMCs also feel too same-y. I don’t think of this as a *huge* issue, because this type of MMC is clearly one that a lot of people enjoy, but it got a little much. Rhys was my favourite character because him going from a stoic cold bodyguard to a sweet loving husband felt natural and like a good progression. There are differences between the characters, but even Josh, who’s supposed to be the most unique, says a lot of the same things and behaves very similarly. 

Best part of the series imo is the friendship between Ava, Bridget, Jules, and Stella. It feels very wholesome and makes me miss my old friendgroup from school, it’s nice, even if we don’t get a lot of scenes with all of them together. 

Overall, good series, but with a lot of issues. Some of them I can overcome (same-y MMCs, cringe dialogue), but some are harder to (Josh’s mistreatment of Jules, money=superpowers) and it sucks because it just drags on the whole series. I’m glad I read it, though, and will recommend it to people going forward. I just wonder what could’ve been had the series been cleaned up more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/17t4ure/the_twisted_series_by_ana_huang_is_such_a_mixed/,2023-11-11T21:49:13Z,9,17,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST
pwk8dc,Something that plays with the concept of the “work wife”,">***Work wife:*** *A woman with whom you work, whose proximity and frequent interaction leads to her becoming your primary female companion during work hours. She will become a substitute for your wife while you are at work, providing companionship and support, but without the emotional and sexual elements. For a time. You will eventually develop a huge crush on her, but will think you've kept it hidden. You haven't -- everyone at work will think it's obvious.*   
>  
>\- [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Work%20wife)

So, I don't particularly love this phrase IRL for a whole host of reasons, but I'm very interested in seeing how it's played with in a romance novel format. And by ""played with,"" I mean I'm open to seeing what's out there, from explorations of the concept to outright critiques.  

Some thoughts:

* I consider ""the work wife"" different from the popular boss/secretary or boss/personal assistant relationship tropes. In those, the supportive relationship is usually one-sided, where the employee (often the FMC) shoulders burdens and emotional labor, but it doesn't go both ways. I'm more interested in seeing something with an even playing field, where the MCs are co-workers
* I don't want the MCs to *actually* be married to other people. If you've got a solid rec where they are, I'm still interested, but I'd like the relationship to be handled with nuance. No cheating, please.
* Would very much not be opposed if a plot point revolved around one of the MCs realizing they were taking the other MC for granted, and the resulting regret and potential ( 🤞 ) groveling fallout when the other MC ""moves on""
* Again, there's no set formula I'm looking for. Friends to lovers, friends to enemies to lovers, one-sided pining, mutual pining -- I'm interested in any and all of it. It'd even be fun to see the FMC as a platonic ""work wife"" for a third-party character, and having the actual MMC struggle with that relationship
* Some other buzzwords that come to mind / I wouldn't mind seeing explored: mutual respect, teamwork, competence, commitment phobia, gender stereotypes, jealousy, different types of love (platonic, romantic, etc.)

Again, I've read my fair share of boss/employee relationships, but I'm more interested in strong co-worker relationships. Most of the books I can think of where the MCs are on a more even playing field (The Hating Game & The Spanish Love Deception) don't fit the vibe I'm going for. I think [Not So Nice Guy by R.S. Grey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41051411-not-so-nice-guy) *does* fit this, but unfortunately, I didn't like it. 

No insta-love or ""body betraying"" lust books, please. TY! (Recs & discussion are both v much appreciated.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/pwk8dc/something_that_plays_with_the_concept_of_the_work/,2021-09-27T16:03:44Z,7,26,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

1bit8dr,Finished Age of the Andinna series by Kristen Banet - Have to gush! Book 7 is The Avatar's Flight,"First post got removed b/c i did not have the author's name in title. I would love to talk about this series though! There will definitely be spoilers in this!!


I just wanted to sing the praises for Kristen Banet. I've never read this author before but I definitely will be in the future. 


This was such a well-crafted series. Every book left me wanting to know more, read more, find more characters and fall in love with the characters already there. I binged this series hard!


I only have two gripes, if we can really call them that. I prefer more explicit spicy scenes, this series was kinda tame that way. For great stories, that's really no big deal. There were a few grammar/spelling issues, but considering there were maybe 5 that I picked out over 7 books, not really a problem. 


Now, to the gushing!! I've read so many RH books and am pretty familiar with most tropes, etc. This one turned a lot of them on their head. All the guys are fleshed out, have their own concerns and others in their lives.It was medium/slow-burn for relationships.  There was no instalove (my pet hate, lol)


It gives POV's of people not in the harem. I've never really seen that done in an RH before.  I loved getting Alchan, Rain, Varon, Lily's thoughts. I especially liked seeing Shadra's thoughts. It also caused a fun game in my mind of 'will this person be in the harem?' Like Trevan and Zayden, I wasn't sure about them at all until later on. 


The story is excellent, very immersive. The war was impressive, they didn't just win all the time. There were serious, permanent injuries. The magic and goddesses were interesting too. I liked that they actually weren't perfect and did what they could to help and guide, but they had their own concerns, too. 


I was actually genuinely surprised by many things that happened. Like Allaina not being a mega-bitch and them becoming friends. Alchan and Rain, although I probably should have seen that one coming. The trap and Kian dying, omg, no. Mave screaming for her Baba was so sad. 


Normally long series just don't hold my interest for long. I read the first, maybe second and part of the third and I'm bored of it. I didn't have that issue at all. As soon as a book was done I moved right on to the next. 


Just, what a series. I loved it!

vptuqp,Twisted Lies was such a disappointing and bewildering end to the Twisted series,"I'm so thoroughly shocked at how bad [this book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60217302-twisted-lies) was I almost wonder if reading it yesterday was some sort of weird fever dream. I would have DNF'd it several times if it weren't for the fact that I didn't come this far not to learn wtf Magda is all about.

For context I liked the [first book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55817097-twisted-love), was ambivalent about [the second](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56653002-twisted-games), loved [the third](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56688531-twisted-hate). Based on the build up and character archetypes I thought I would love the fourth/final.

On paper we have:

* billionaire, alpha, protective, possessive, dangerous/ morally grey MMC
* successful, driven, creative, beautiful, intelligent, fashionable FMC
* fake relationship
* sexual tension/ slow burn
* stalker/ danger to the FMC
* the culmination of a beloved series

All those things should make for a pretty entertaining book! But this book read like a poor first draft of all of those things.

First, there was just so much repetition of the author (through the character) telling us rather than showing us. I lost count of know how many times the MMC told us he didn't deserve the FMC because  he's such a bad guy and has some deep dark secret. And the use of the journal format for the FMC just felt like a lazy way for the author to do the same - to have the character tell us who she is instead of show us.

Second, the revelation of the significance of Magda was so underwhelming and like unimportant to the plot of the rest of the books.

Some other things that just made me mad:

* >!Early in the book we find out the FMC has bondage fantasies that she's never told anyone about. Then the first time they actually act these out are off-page! She does get tied up during the boat scene but she mentions that it wasn't the first time they had done that. !<So basically the fact that she told him about a fantasy she'd never shared with anyone and they acted it out for the first time wasn't important enough to actually include that in the book? We're just gonna blow right past that? Ok so then what was the point of making a big deal of the fact that she's never shared that fantasy with anyone?
* >!The MMC killed three different people on-page during the book!< and we don't get a single scene with the FMC sort of reckoning with this? What's the point of making a character morally grey if you're not also going to have the love interest wrestle with this? Early in the book she briefly wrestles with the vague notion that he is a ""dangerous guy"" but only on a surface level.
* >!The idea of a security professional having a dossier on his girlfriend who is actively being stalked !<is just not that weird, I'm sorry. It actually seems sensible. I know the author was trying to make it a big deal by >!making it clear that he started the dossier years before ""meeting"" her but even that seems pretty easily addressed by the fact that he deliberately stayed away from her after that first encounter years ago AND the dossier only contained publicly available information (despite the fact the MMC has plenty of know-how and access to get private information).!<
* Everything about the MMCs parents. >!His dad was an art thief? His mom so in love she couldn't live without him? His mom made one bad painting and the very existience of the painting somehow becomes the MMCs albatross?!< None of this storyline held up to even basic scrutiny. 
* The MMC's business rivals >!thought the MMC stored ""business secrets"" in the painting? How would one even do that?!<

Overall the book was flimsy, poorly written, too long, and reached no satisfactory conclusion. The smut was pretty good but even then there was way too much unnecessary ""no we can't"" before they finally did the deed. Going forward, I'll probably just recommend that people read [Twisted Hate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56688531-twisted-hate) as a standalone and breeze past any mention of a painting in the plot because it's not important.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/vptuqp/twisted_lies_was_such_a_disappointing_and/,2022-07-02T15:10:49Z,50,62,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST
vbrfn0,When the MMC takes care of the FMC after the FMC has been in the hospital/injured but the FMC doesn't want him to,"I find these scenes to be very cute (especially if the MMC is this big, strong, tough guy). So looking for books with scenes where there's a tough guy who ends up taking care of the FMC (even though she'd prefer him not to). She eventually relents and he continues on taking that caretaker role. The caretaking doesn't need to take up a huge portion of the book, just want it somewhere.

I am a smut reader, so smut must be in the book. No paranormal/fantasy or historical, please. Contemporary tends to be more my style. I'm not opposed to dark romances. I'm not a big fan of the friends-to-lovers, brother's best friend and (current or ex) boyfriend's dad trope, but if it's really recommended, I'll make an exception lol.

Examples that I can think of, off the top of my head:

* Viper's Run by Jamie Begley
* He’s a Brute by Chloe Liese
* Security Breach by Evan Grace
* Lead Security by Evan Grace

le6yps,Trying to find the perfect book! AGAIN :),"I'm getting desperate. I read and read and read and all I get is DNF or I finish it and I'm just mad at myself for even giving it the time.

EDIT:

Well, now that I see it all written down, there is a lot of points...well, anyway. If you don't want to read it all, just skip to books I enjoyed and recommend something similar please! :)

&#x200B;

WHAT I LIKE

\- romance is one of the main parts of the story ( I mostly enjoy enemies to lovers with funny banter and good tension)

\- M/M or M/F

\- SLOW BURN (I don't mind waiting few books for them to even kiss)

\- SINGLE POV (I want to feel like the main H/h and I can't do that if I know something that he/she doesn't) I did read ONE good dual POV - Flatshare - everything else just made me lose interest after a while)

\- don't care if it's fantasy, contemporary or anything else (although I'm not a big fan of historical but that's mostly just because they all seem to be dual POV - Pride and Prejudice is awesome!)

\- don't mind If there are some typical cliches as long as the writing is good (and by that I mean you can actually see the progress in the relationship. I read a book where they went from ""I hate you and will kill you and eat you"" to ""I love you and will do everything in my power to protect you even if it means betraying everyone I know"" in a matter of days and that's just.....God.....)

\- the other H will make the first move (the person whose POV I'm reading will be kissed)

\- I like when the main character is unaware that the other one likes them, at least for a while. Then he/she finds out and still can't believe it or doesn't want it for any kind of reason 

&#x200B;

WHAT I HATE 

\- alfa male ( I don't mind If he's a dominant but something along the lines of ""you will end up in my bed because I want it and know it"" is insta DNF for me). I need for him to be full of doubt or at least a bit insecure. You know, respecting when a girl says NO, give her space. Like yeah, you can see her nipples are hard but she's saying no for christ sake..

\- insta love (every time I read ""my mind hates him but my body doesn't""  I get mad) 

\- second chances romance

\- love triangle (not a serious one anyway - main character is deciding between two guys)

\- clean romance (just a few mentions of penises or vaginas is fine, I don't need it minute by minute)

\- 25 +, no teens (but If they are mature I can just pretend they are older)

\- bad and rushed writing, complicated info dump

\- sleeping together before they fall in love (I've tried reading books like that - one night stand and then later they meet/get to know each other or something - I just can't get into it. I like my h to be innocent, not sleeping around)

&#x200B;

BOOKS I ENJOYED

\- Hating Game, Beach Read, Unhoneymooners

\- ACOTAR (but Throne of glass was a bit disappointing), FEVER series, Cruel Prince, The Raven cycle

\- Magic Forged (Shea), Boyfriend material, Signs of love (Anyta Sunday)

\- all of Annette Marie's books (Demonized is my favorite though)

\- all of Maria Zapata's books (yup, read them ALL)

 

Mostly I enjoy friendly banter, tension between them but never any touches or kisses. I want that ""will they, won't they vibe"" - it's full of moments that you just want to scream at them to kiss, but nothing ever happens (until it does of course :))

ul2yc6,Just finished The Love Hypothesis,"Spoilers ahead! 

I read it in a day. I could NOT PUT IT DOWN! I don’t know what it was about this sweet romance novel?! It was just simply wonderful. 

Maybe it was because at times it made me literally laugh out loud? 

Maybe it was because I’m all for a brooding, dark MMC? 

Maybe it was because Olive was a really likable FMC? 

Maybe it was because Adam was absolute perfection and the chocolate protein bar is what really did it for me?

r6w2rk,Here is every book I've read from this subreddit in the last 14 weeks and how I would rank them,"I joined this subreddit 3 months ago looking for a good book to read, and safe to say I found a few. Looking back on my kindle library, I've read 50 books since joining and I desperately need more. I still work from home so I have a lot of free time, and finding all of these recommendations has been great for me. 

I'm going on a cruise for a week here soon, and I need several recommendations that I can download while I still have internet before I get on the ship. What better way to get good recommendations than to tell you what stories I've already read? So, here goes nothing. I'll try to keep it short unless I have a lot to say about any of the books. If you happen to disagree with any of my thoughts, I'd love to hear them too! Of course these are just my opinions, so nothing personal if I didn't like a book you did!

SPOILERS AHEAD!

&#x200B;

* **The Simple Wild** trilogy by KA Tucker. *10 out of 10.* What a great start this was! These books are actually still my favorite out of every other thing I've read lately. I loved every minute of Jonah and Calla's story. Can't wait for book four.
* **All Rhodes Lead Here** by Mariana Zapata**-** *7 out of 10.* I liked it, but definitely didn't love it. The pet names drove me nuts, and Aurora was too immature and naïve for someone her age. I really liked the nontraditional family dynamic with Rhodes and Am, though. Great setting, too. 
* **The Gamble** by Kristen Ashley- *1 out of 10.* DNF @ 60%. I couldn't stand the main characters, the writing style, the dialogue, basically everything! I won't read another book by Kristen Ashley if I can help it. This book was not it. I'm surprised I was able to read more than half of this book. 
* **After We Fall** by Melanie Harlow- *4 out of 10.*
* **It Happened One Summer** by Tessa Bailey- *5 out of 10.* 
* **Fix Her Up** by Tessa Bailey- 2 *out of 10.* Holy shit I hated this book! Out of the ones I finished, this was my least favorite. Georgie was great. She is why I had to complete this book. Travis, however, is the worst MMC I've ever seen. Seriously. I know possessiveness can be attractive to some people, and I can handle a certain amount, but this guy was so toxic to Georgie. Georgie is constantly talking about how she wants to be treated like an adult and taken seriously, yet Travis is constantly belittling her and treating her like a helpless child. I hated reading his chapters because all he ever thinks about is sex. I get this is a romance book and all, but come on Travis, you're a grown ass man. Control yourself. His proposal at the end made me cringe so hard I had to put the book down and pick it up later. Fuck Travis Ford. 
* **Hothead** by Stella Rhys- *8/10.* This book is what Fix Her Up could have been. It has fake dating and the MMC is a baseball player. Drew and Evie were so much better together than Georgie and Travis. I loved it, honestly. It was fantastic.
* **I Owe You One** by Sophie Kinsella- *5/10.*
* **Tinfoil Heart** by Daisy Prescott- *6/10*
* **Happy Trail** by Daisy Prescott- *9/10.* Fucking loved it. Can you tell I like books that take place in rural locations/surrounded by nature?
* **How to Walk Away** by Katherine Center- *9/10.* This book made me go read a bunch of other Katherine Center books. I adored everything about this book. 10 out of 10.
* **Things You Save in a Fire** by Katherine Center- *6/10.* It was still good, but I would have liked to see the MC's interact a little more. I didn't believe they were actually in love at the end. 
* **Happiness for Beginners** by Katherine Center- *10/10.* Obsessed with this book. I've read it twice now. No complaints whatsoever. 
* **Breathe the Sky** by Michelle Hazen- DNF at 15% and for the life of me, I cannot remember why. I might have to go back and try this one again.
* **The Tourist Attraction** series- *9/10.* Loved. I'm slowly finding out that if you write a book that takes place in Alaska, I'll probably like it! Read every book that's been released. 
* **Happy Singles Day** by Ann Marie Walker- *6/10*
* **The Player Next Door** by KA Tucker- *9/10* I liked this book a LOT more than I thought I would. Because of this I read more books by KA Tucker. She's a wonderful author.
* **Twice Shy** by Sarah Hodge- *7/10*
* **The Unhoneymooners** by Christina Lauren- *9/10*
* **Above and Beyond** by Kathryn Shay- *5/10*
* **The Spanish Love Deception** by Elena Armas- *10/10.* 
* **The Cheat Sheet** by Sarah Adams- DNF at 25%. I might have to go back and try this one again. It couldn't hold my interest the first time.
* **Second First Impressions** by Sally Thorne-*4/10.* 
* **The Off-Limits Rule** by Sarah Adams- *8/10.* I went into this with low expectations since I couldn't finish the last Sarah Adams book I read, but I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this book. Cooper is fantastic! I loved reading his chapters. 
* **Until It Fades** by KA Tucker- *9/10.* I've loved every KA Tucker book I've read so far, and this one is no exception. Brett is the sweetest!
* **Say You Still Love Me** by KA Tucker- *10/10.* I would love to meet KA Tucker and tell her about how much I loved this story. Every minute of it was so enjoyable. 
* **Beach Read** by Emily Henry-*9/10.*
* **People We Meet on Vacation** by Emily Henry- *8/10.* Everything about Emily Henry's writing style is so refreshing and real to me. She truly is a great author, and her characters are very relatable and raw. I would read anything she publishes.
* **Loving the Ladies' Man** by Kristin Canary- *6/10.*
* **The Roommate Situation** by Katie Bailey- *4/10.* 
* **That Fine Line** by Cindy Steel-*3/10.*
* **The Hating Game** by Sally Thorne- *4/10.* I know, right? This books seems right up my alley, but I don't know...I didn't like Josh? Was I supposed to like Josh? 
* **Josh and Hazel's Guide to Not Dating** by Christina Lauren- *10/10.* I LOVED this Josh. 
* **I Hated You First** by Rachel John-*3/10.* 
* **So Not My Thing** by Melanie Jacobson- DNF @ 40%. 
* **Wild Open Hearts** by Kathryn Nolan- *7/10.* Does the author understand how much a billion dollars is? I don't think she does. This book doesn't give me the impression that she does. 
* **Kulti** by Mariana Zapata- DNF @ 46%.
* **The Love Hypothesis** by Ali Hazelwood- *8/10.* Really enjoyed this one, actually. Great banter between the two MC's.
* **Rock Bottom Girl** by Lucy Score-*9/10.* This book was VERY GOOD! Had no expectations going in and was very satisfied. Couldn't put this one down. 
* **The Love Act** by Zara Bell- *8/10.* I guess I really like celebrity fake relationship books? Who woulda thought? 
* **Can You Keep a Secret** by Sophie Kinsella- *6/10.* Better than the movie. 
* **Blue-Eyed Devil** and **Smooth Talking Stranger** by Lisa Kleypas- *5/10* and *6/10.*  Jack and Ella's story was better than Haven and Hardy's, but in general these books are way more misogynistic than they need to be.  I get it takes place in Texas or whatever (that's how the story explains their possessiveness and overall uncomfortable demeanor), but Jack and Hardy need to calm the hell down. 
* **To Love Jason Thorne** by Ella Maise-*8/10.*
* **To Hate Adam Connor** by Ella Maise-*6/10.* Jason and Olive had a better story. Adam is great, though. 
* **Alaskan Wild** by Helena Newbury- What I'm currently reading! About halfway through it. 
* One quick (not) honorable mention- In the past I've read Sarah J. Maas, which I've seen mentioned on here a lot. I have read most of Throne of Glass and ACOTAR series. SJM is probably my least favorite author, if I had to pick one. I find her books to be very white-washed, problematic, confusing, and oftentimes blatantly plagiarized. I'm genuinely sorry if you really do enjoy her books, they just aren't for me.

np1p0o,Lords of Pain by Angel Lawson - am I the only reader who is confused/ guilty about enjoying this?,"I just finished [this book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56986379-lords-of-pain) and am TORN UP about it. It is by no means a romance and has all of the things that I usually hate: 

* super-victimized inexperienced FMC who is constantly taken advantage of and abused by men and who then turns to more bad men for help rather than, y'know, actual authorities
* über-asshole, rapist, over-sexed, sociopathic MMCs who fetishize the FMC's virginity and manipulate her at every opportunity
* completely unrealistic setting (a university with students who are crime lords, NFL hopefuls, and ""royalty"" all at the same time??)
* bullying, rape, forced sexual encounters, unprotected sex, objectification of women all over the place, etc., etc. 

and yet... I enjoyed the crap out of it and am eagerly anticipating the release of the second in the series!

14y7tkw,Villain woman (not fmc) who is supposed to be hated by us (readers) falls in love with someone & even if she does bad things we can’t help but root for her HEA. Getting the inspo from a turkish tv series. Please read. 😔🙏,"The inspo of this post comes from the turkish tv show ***O Hayat Benim*** *(English title: That is my life) (spanish title: Se robó mi vida).* There’s a villain, her name is **Efsun** and she is the funniest character of that show, she’s so charismatic and genius that even when she does mean things to people, one can’t help but root for her; she also suffers A LOT, like seriously a lot of ugly things happened to her that I reached a point in where I only cared about her happy ending. For plot reasons **she forces Arda to marry her.** They hate each other, and he knows exactly the kind of person she is but has no other choice but to marry her. Through the farce of marriage, and because he wants to piss off his mom, Arda plays along Efsun’s games and they eventually fall head over heels in love with each other. 
He never tried to change her, he knew her way of thinking and her schemes and still fell HARD for her. Unfortunately  >!they don’t have a happy ending together, but!< I enjoyed watching their journey together. 

THOSE ARE THE VIBES THAT I’M LOOKING FOR: **An unapologetic villain who’s waaayyy more likeable than the fmc. Eventually falls in love but she doesn’t completely change (or doesn’t at all) and she doesn’t “turns good’’ because she’s in love AND he’s on board on all her schemes.** ❤️‍🔥

gie05o,Books like The Kiss Quotient,"Okay, so I'm a little late to the party.

I read The Kiss Quotient last night and was completely blown away. I don't know why I put off reading this book for so long but it was so darn good...and now I want more.

Stella is probably the most real heroine that I've come across in a romance novel...maybe ever. I loved her inner monologue - it was equal parts clever, funny, and emotional. Her anxieties were described and written so honestly that I felt like I was experiencing everything right there with her. I like the idea of a heroine who isn't extremely outspoken but also isn't a quiet helpless little mouse who needs to be rescued all the damn time.

Having said that, I'm looking for books y'all think have a similar vibe. Doesn't have to be about autism or any sort of disorder, really. Just something kind of unique I guess. Something with a heroine who isn't perfect (but not a bitch), a non-asshole hero, and a some humour. Steam is much appreciated as well.

**The Wall of Winnipeg and Me by Mariana Zapata**: what if JJ Watt had the personality (or lack thereof) and single-minded focus of Tom Brady but also was Canadian and needed a green-card marriage

* Rating: 3.5/5 vegan smoothie recipes from TB12. Major deduction for the glacial pace and the fact that I hate the patriots

**Heated Rivalry by Rachel Reid:** what if Sidney Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin were gay (to wit – an r/hockey post this week titled “When we realized Crosby and Ovi are tied in career points, we decided to chart their year-by-year stats”)

* Rating: 5/5 viewings of the 2011 season of the HBO series *24/7*

**Hotheads by Stella Rhys:** what if Derek Jeter was a pitcher and the Yankees didn’t have an airtight public code of conduct policy. What if a Major League manager let a starting pitcher run up 12 runs during the fifth inning before taking him out. (the single sports romance detail that kills me)

* Rating: 3.5/5 mimosas featuring a lobster claw. Full point deduction for lack of Spanish in the locker room and a half point for not a single mention of baseball players’ necklace game

**Cold Fury Hockey series by Sawyer Bennett:** what if the Carolina Hurricanes were called the Carolina Cold Fury (there is an ALARMING amount of niche Raleigh content in these, including the buildings and general area where some of the current players live)

* Series Rating: 4/5 Max Pacioretty’s, who is in real life married to the sister of his former teammate

**The Horde Kings of Dakkar by Zoey Draven:** what if the Dothraki lived in outer space. What if “rasp” was a typical verb to denote the speaker in dialogue.

* Series Rating: 4.5/5 Khal Drogos. Half point deduction because this is the only fantasy/alien romance series where I want more lore than sex

**Sports romances:** what if all professional athletes were 6’5” and white and not still dating and/or married to their high school or college girlfriend

* Genre rating: 4/5 puck bunnies, who I feel get a bad rap

**HRs:** what if there were more than 24 non-royal dukes and they all needed a wife between 1802 and 1830

* Genre rating: 4/5 rescues from ruin by a reformed rake (if you’re lucky, he might even be a RogueTM)

**Motorcycle club romance:** what if Charlie Hunnam was your boyfriend. What if female romance novelists could possibly conceive of a way for adult men to have close intimate relationships without some sort of external force tying them together (see also: sports romance, mafia romance…)

11tc8c2,"Looking for believable CR or speculative plots, good dialogue (funny banter is a plus), light vs. dark themes or tension, established vibes, and anything else that might tick the boxes on my big trope/genre list","I swear I've searched through the subreddit and picked out a few things to read, but I'd love more personalized recs. I read a lot and adore romance (usually romantic subplots) in stories, but I find a lot in the romance genre doesn't work for me. I'm _really_ wanting to find things I LOVE and can recommend to others without too many reservations. 

""Book requests must be specific and contain detail,"" so sayeth the rules. WELL, I've got plenty of specifics and details!

## I like/love (alphabetical order):
Accidental dating/marriage, action/adventure, angels/demons, apocalypses/dystopias, BAMFs, **banter**, beautiful prose, blended families, boss/employee, competency/confidence, dark themes, **dialogue!**, doctors, dubcon (no noncon), enemies to lovers, erotica, **established relationship**, fake dating/marriage, forced proximity, found family, good parents, **good/believable plots**, himbos, humor, interracial relationships, interspecies relationships (though the more humanlike, the better), kink and BDSM (emphasis on the B and D/s; prefer bratty subs and enthusiastic fun), lovers who will kill for each other, low fantasy, morally grey characters, sex farces, sexual tension, slow burn, soft scifi, sweet/kind/thoughtful characters, tricksters, **urban fantasy**, **""us against the world""**

I really can't stress how much I like banter. Also, I think it's obvious I like a lot of light/dark tension. If it's dark _and_ humorous, I'm there.

I read some contemporary romance, but I'm picky:

* Mariana Zapata tends to keep me amused and entertained, but I could do with more spice.

* From what I remember, I mostly liked Talia Hibbert's _The Roommate Risk_.

* Natasha Boyd's _Accidental Tryst_ was okay, as was Sally Thorne's _Hating Game_.

* Christina Lauren can be fun, but they're sort of hit or miss for me. They're prolific, so if you have specific recs from them, let me know.

* A few CR writers have infuriated me. They include EL James, JT Geissinger, Sylvia Day, and Renee Carlino. No shade to anyone who likes them, but they are not for me.

I read a lot of fantasy: 

* No need to rec me Ilona Andrews. I've tried their stuff to varying degrees of success. Going to try _Hidden Legacy_.

* I need to try the _Mercy Thompson_ series, though werewolves are...less my thing.

* Karen Marie Moning's _Fever_ series was fun for me...until it wasn't.

* I read some of the _Night Huntress_ series, but, wow, it was pretty sexist, slut-shamey, and biphobic to me. It got better as the series went on (I don't know why I kept reading; you know how it is), but I didn't finish it.

* Didn't like Gail Carriger's _Soulless_.

* Loved the world in Jacqueline Carey's _Phèdre's Trilogy_, but didn't really like the lack of dialogue in her writing or always enjoy the characters.

## Don't like:
* Bizarre/cracky/weird. I've tried. It's not the books. It's me.

* Cheating and dumb miscommunications. Just fucking talk to each other, you numpties.

* I don't mind a story that has iffy/bad consent vibes. I can even like that (in fiction). But I don't want it anywhere near kink/BDSM. Good consent etiquette in this area for me or nothing.  

* Probably most mafia romance. A lot of it seems cringe to me from the outside. However, if you want to try to convince me, I won't stop you!

* Regency or historical, usually. I know, I'm sorry! An exception to this is the _Outlander_ series, which I honestly love more for its history...

* The classic ""They kissed/screwed. [end last chapter, open epilogue] Now they're married and have babies!"" is a little tired and not at all relatable to me as a happily partnered but childfree person. I don't hate it, especially if it feels right for the characters, but eh.

## Required:
* Absolutely no ""pure"" or ""clean"" romance, romance with religious messaging, romance with a very religious MC, or frankly painfully obvious American conservative vibes. All of this easily tips into real trigger territory for me.

* HEA or HFN only. If I want to see women and queer people getting fucked in a bad way, I'll read the news. 😒

* If a series is focused on the same characters throughout, I'd appreciate you only rec it if it's finished or soon to be. I like to binge, and I don't like series that have no end.

## Preferred, but not required:
* Strongly prefer monogamous M/F and F/F, but will accept well-written poly where no character feels like a third (or more) wheel. Also strongly prefer pairings with at least one woman in them. M/M can be very hit or miss for me, but it's not a hard no.

* Third-person narration or _single_ first-person narration. I _will_ read a dual first-person POV, but I grumble. Many dual first-person POVs I've read sound too similar or sometimes the male POV feels horribly stereotyped.

* Characters over the age of 25 or even, gasp, 30+. College romances can work for me, but they have to sell it. Please, no YA.

* I don't require erotica, but I love a book where the romantic interests are having sex throughout or halfway through and onward. Not a huge fan of closed-door only.

165jt2b,Unhinged but charismatic FMC and the sexy man who chases after her - this book was wonderfully crazy! Airplane Games by Cat Wynn,"I mostly lurk on this sub but this book brought me out of hiding because it’s so different from any other romance I’ve ever read and I haven’t seen many people talking about it.

I’ve read another book by this author which I loved, but this one was on a whole different level and I def wasn’t expecting it.

Elliot is a very charismatic and possibly unhinged destination wedding photography and Parker is a traveling high end mechanic. They run into each other over and over again at mostly airports because they both travel constantly for work. Parker falls hard for the wild and bold Elliot, but she’s hard to catch, thus ensues a playful game of cat and mouse between the two all around the world.

First thing, the FMC Elliot is totally wild. She has a lot of problems and they run deep but she’s so funny and outgoing and bold you just kind of end up loving her (although, I think some people also hate this kind of character, and I could definitely see why, but I loved her). Her personality is really tempered by the more subdued/sensitive/serious MMC Parker. 

The entire book is in Parker’s point of view, which I rarely read in romance (and frankly is rarely done well), so his character has a lot of depth even though he’s far from perfect. I really appreciated that because sometimes I feel like in MF romance its the MMC who has to change and grow with a perfect FMC but this was not the case in this book. Parker was extra sexy as well, but his character did occasionally drive me nuts. 

These two characters together have off the charts chemistry - like my book was practically smoking from the heat between them. Because much of the story is these two characters chasing each other around the world in different airports/hotels/cities, the push and pull is nonstop and it's super fast paced with a kind of international and fantastical vibe.

Also, this isn’t a book with a flimsy miscommunication conflict or what have you. The HEA is really hard won. Both characters really have to work through their shit, and they actually do! I thought I was sure every chapter which way the book was going to go and I was dead wrong every time.

Of course, the sex is absolutely unreal. Like I said before, the chemistry is jumping off the page, and it really pays off with each sex scene.  

And lastly, although I’d say this book was a romcom, I definitely cried at more than a few parts of the book, especially because there are scenes that direct address the character’s very real traumas. Unexpectedly emotional and touching! I don’t know, like I said, I really wasn’t expecting it (because of the ridiculously amazing sex), but the author’s writing style elevates the story a lot too. I absolutely love Cat Wynn's style - it's smart, funny, and doesn't take the reader's intelligence for granted. I thought it was a major breath of fresh air - something I search for in my romances! Absolutely 5 stars. Please go read it!!!

lvhyuc,"ya/na fantasy romance where the fmc falls for the villain/antihero and ends up on his side, with an immersive world and magic","fmc who: 
- is morally grey (a must), not a goody two shoes at all but still HAS morals 
- is not shy or meek or someone who blushes at every thing (the fmc blushing every 2 seconds in books is really very annoying)
- can keep up with and match the villain LI’s quips and teasing etc and isn’t constantly at a loss for words

villain love interest
- an actual bad guy who does bad shit and never claims to be a good guy
- jealous 
- possessive
- can’t keep her hands off of of her (like the love interests in the Caraval series)
- very powerful
- doesnt just want her as a sex slave 
- never becomes a hero and never tries to be a ‘good guy’ either (like Legend in Legendary (Book 2 of Caraval) quite literally says something like “I’m not selfless or altruistic and I’m not the hero in this story.” 
*although* I did kinda like Warner and Juliette in the Shatter Me series even though he joins *her* side (which is the good side) and not the other way round 
- please no long haired guys like Malachiasz from Wicked Saints

what I’d like out of the romance

- she falls for him and realises he’s not SO bad (but is still of course a bad guy) and then their goals align (I really love this bit, where it turns out they have either a bigger bad to defeat (Finale in Caraval series) or the villain LI’s schemes actually make sense (Kingdom of Flesh and Fire in the FBAA series)
- Enemies to lovers/ enemies *and* lovers (that’s a given since the villain will of course be her enemy initially) HOWEVER not an e2m rom where they’re simply enemies by name or she just hates him simply because his role is as her rival (like in contemporary romance books where they’re only enemies because they’re from rival families and when they meet they realise they actually like each other) I want her to hate him for a *reason*
- they tease each other and taunt each other often and play games with whatever is between them (like in Legendary or in the contemp rom book The Hating Game)
- a romance that ISNT straight forward
   > I want them to resist and deny their feelings, push each other away, maybe a little heartbreak etc (i.e >!Tella and Legend!< in the Caraval series) I don’t want to see romance where they meet, sparks fly, kiss here kiss there, love profession, fluffy love while the rest of the plot plays out 
      > that being said, no soft fluffy romance please

- Romance where the villain’s actions speak louder than his words like the Villanous LIs in the Caraval series claim they can’t/ don’t love her and yet their actions say the opposite
   > the type of romance where the villain would burn 
      the whole world down just to kiss her, damn 
      himself and the world so long as *she’s* fine
      & i don’t mind a love triangle if both the guys are      
      bad guys/ villains 


how I feel about sexual explictness: 
I genuinely don’t mind if the book is or isn’t. I think steamy sex scenes work great for some books like From Blood and Ash & Kingdom of Flesh and Fire, or ACOMAF while the lack of explicit scenes work better for other books like the Caraval series and The Shadows Between Us for example where the author still manages to build sexual tension and the build up is enjoyable to read. 
  - To expand on the lack of explicit intimate scenes in the Caraval series, I think it worked perfectly because of how every scene between the fmc & her respective scenes with each love interest still depicted intimacy like I LOVE LOVE LOVED reading the LI (before they got together) just touching her sort of absentmindedly like hand on her waist, brushing fingers, knees brushing, hand on the small of her back, hand stroking her spine, hand on the back of her neck or stroking the column of her neck with his thumb, that sort of loving touch and they weren’t doing it all those times to seduce her specifically but just because they want to touch her. 
I feel a lot of other books lack this and thus it works better for there to be sex scenes as pay off for the previous romantic build up. 


what I’d like out of the story
- an immersive fantasy world, I really loved the world of Caraval 
- good imagery so a mini movie can play in my mind 
- interesting magic system (magic is a must have I think) 
- I love reading about pretty gowns the fmc wears (like in the Caraval series-can you tell I just finished reading this loool) and pretty scene backdrops that scenes are set in
- maybe something dramatic, not drab, theatrical and ostentatious (that’s how I would best describe the world of Caraval) 

extra note: Down for ‘blood stuff’ in books when it’s written well like:
- Tella and her love interest in Legendary at one point exchange blood and the experience was both emotional and intimate and I loved that and how it exposed what he was willing to do for her
> also weirdly I liked the >!bloody tears!< lol the fanart made it look pretty
- Stolas in Kingdom of Runes series’ Book4 and >!Hawk!< in KoFaF (theyre both I guess technically vampires but I don’t really want to read something marketed *as* a vamp romance lol)

if anyone is looking for anything similar the only books I can think of apart from the Caraval series (what drove me to write this request) and the others I mentioned briefly are:
- The Shadows Between Us & The Wrath of Dawn (both are that ‘I was gonna kill you but never mind because I love you now’) trope which I don’t know if I want to read more off currently 

I feel like The Cruel Prince & Bridge Kingdom might come up but I didn’t enjoy either
: TCP - I was NOT into Cardan’s tail and wasnt into the whole bullying thing it was annoying
: TBK - romance was too choppy for me it just wasn’t woven into the plot well enough for me. they basically just sit on boats have a couple battles couple kisses and then the love profession came too quick and with no build up or substance to it (in my opinion)

I’ve been searching for a couple days on tiktok and other reddit threads and have a little list so maybe if anyone’s read any of these you could tell me if they match what I’m looking for more or less?

The Young Elites, The Antagonists, Kushiel’s Dart, Heartless, Furyborn (I started the first book might pick it up again), A Deadly Education (the Scholomance series I believe), The Night Circus (seems to be similar to the world of Caraval? as does Where the Dreams Descend), Vicious and Vengeful by V.E Schwab 

Thank you so much if you read all that and can think of any books to recommend! Really appreciate it! 

I’ve read a bunch of enemies to lovers (message me if you’d like any recs I’ve read so many now lol) but haven’t read enough of this falling for the villain who *stays* bad trope (they usually always turn good for her and I’m a bit bored of that)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/lvhyuc/yana_fantasy_romance_where_the_fmc_falls_for_the/,2021-03-01T19:25:56Z,30,42,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

mzfehn,Anyone read the Dark Fae: Black World series by Quinn Blackbird?? Oh I've got feelings on this one...,"I haven't seen this series mentioned a lot on here. For those that don't know it, it's a really exciting, somewhat angsty, steamy fantasy/fae true enemies-to-lovers series of 4 novellas (ca. 500 total pages). The hero is really quite evil...a true anti-hero, and there are definitely some darker themes in there and some dubcon. I really, really LOVED most of it. But HATED HATED HATED the ending. I haven't been this disappointed since watching Game of Thrones. (grrrrrrrr.) 

**Has anyone else read it? If so, how did you feel about the ending? Has anyone read more by this author?**  


Spoilers below...

\>!While not perfect, I feel like the plot, build up, tension between the characters was all awesome. Some great steamy scenes, and I love a good fantasy romance where the dude is just straight up evil and the heroine is often terrified. Makes for some real entertainment. But I also really crave a good redemption with anything darker. And this had it!! Really, this series was shaping up so nicely...and then...then...the author just destroys you and gives an ending that can BARELY even be considered a HEA. Even though the hero more or less does a 180 for the heroine, is completely obsessed with her, injures himself while rescuing her, sacrifices part of his soul to bring her back from the freaking dead, relinquishes his royal title for her, and they are married for 12 years and he still loves and obsesses over her happiness, the heroine's just like ""meh"" and basically admits she'll never love him (although she is still attracted to him. They have a child who is turning into an awful person, the heroine is basically just always sad, and at the end, the hero suggests she makes friends to find some joy since he can't make her happy. I'm surprised it's even categorized as Romance to be honest and I AM SO FREAKING ANGRY AND DISAPPOINTED.!<

\>!Like, why oh why would an author do this?? Sure, some folks on Goodreads are saying things like ""Oh, it's a ""mature"" ending."" Screw that...I want my flowers and hearts ending. And we know that's expected in Romance. I can handle when things don't go perfectly. When things feel a little bittersweet. And especially if it's not in the ""Romance"" genre then it's more expected. But in either case, this just didn't make sense to me. She had feelings for him early on. The hero was redeemable. They were together for 12 years without major issues, so one would assume that perhaps a love could bloom in that time. There was no good reason for this ending other than to piss off readers and make an attempt at being edgy. Ugh. Such a shame. I was really enjoying this author. Honestly, I'd love to give her other stuff a try, but now I'm scared!!!!!!.!<",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/mzfehn/anyone_read_the_dark_fae_black_world_series_by/,2021-04-27T03:23:38Z,20,4,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

ph0dvs,MMC like Aaron from The Spanish Love Deception (Elena Armas)?,"I've found my type. It's Aaron from The Spanish Love Deception (by Elena Armas). GOD. Alpha but not too alpha? Cold at first but not bitter? Dom but also a Consent King? (YES, I know!)
So was on a hunt to find something similar to this. Stumbled upon The Favor (by Suzzane Wright). Just finished it, in fact. And it was... something. Well, basically the MMC did not work for me. Crossed the line too many times. No consent, kinda objectified the FMC, was bitter and cruel at times. 

Anyway, so any book reccomendations that feature an MMC like Aaron from The Spanish Love Deception?

1as9k89,"Have you'll read The Blackened Blade (by Isla Davon) yet? If not, that should be your weekend plan.","**Tropes:**

Why choose/Fated Mates/PNR/Bully/University

**TW:**

Physical & emotional bullying/>!Attempted SA on the FMC (not by the MMC's) Death!</Mental & Emotional trauma

&#x200B;

Alrighty folks, let's chat about {The Blackened Blade by Isla Davon} and why it's a must read.

The most basic plot summary is this: Micai (the FMC), age 28 dies in a supernatural prison from a fire (no spoiler here, it's literally chapter 1).  Her last thoughts are “if I could redo my life, I would.  I wouldn't be a pushover and no one would take advantage of me” (paraphrasing of course).    Through the use of magic, Micai is transported back to when she was 17/18 with all of her memories from the last 10 years (the length she was in prison plus some).  She wakes up in an academy that magical peoples attend, that she attended before.

This go around, Micai takes no shit and stands up for herself. Often times we read about a strong heroine, but she fails in so many regards.  An authors version of “strong” tends to be mouthy, but physically weak and succumbs to body betrayal syndrome too often.  Or the heroine will often come in with fire and fury, but losses all sense of self once they are around their fated mates.  Micai isn't like that.  When she wakes up, she knows that she is physically weak and works hard to remedy that.  She also is mentally tougher than anyone gives her credit for.

The majority of the book is spent with Micai fighting back; living and not surviving; understanding how this timeline is different from the other; and righting some wrongs.

It was truly wonderful to watch Micai blossom and use her inner strength to push herself well beyond what she thought she was capable of.

This book is VERY low steam.  Like,>! just kisses happen.!<

Now this book is part of a series, but we don't know when book 2 is dropping.  The author communicates on FB, TikTok, and Instagram that she is working on book 2 as fast as she can.

**Spoiler territory:**

Now, if you've already read this book let's chat.  Because, man do I need to discuss some of my theories surrounding Micai and her mates.

Okay guys and gals, let's chat about her half-sister Seria.  Here's my take on her: >!she's a siren that is able to manipulate people through touch AND voice.  Every time that Seria touched Micai, she experienced an “ick” sensation running through her body.  Also, any time that Micai started to speak, her former friends were described as having almost like a haze being lifted from their vision. But Seria would touch that person, and all of their attention would refocus on Serai and the haze would reappear. Micai recgonizes this in Serai as well when she says, “It almost seemed like a game.  Some fun and natural ability to mould and shape other words and thoughts to suit her own agenda.” !<

Also, what is up with Serai?! She appeared>! in Micai's life when Micai was like 12 or 13 and there's only a year or two between them.  WHERE DID SHE COME FROM? Why haven't we heard about the stepmom yet?!<

Hold your pants for this next theory of mine.  When Micai was >!in prison, she was told by Zrael that they were fated mates.  But due to the loss of his singing voice and the strain the experiments put on them both, a clear and distinct voice was near impossible to focus on.  I believe that Ezra and Zrael are the same person.!<  **CRAZY RIGHT??!!** The >!names are somewhat similar and how they discovered each other (via song) is also eerily similar. !<

As for Micai's fated mates? In the original timeline I believe >!that her former best friends would have been her harem, but now in this secondary time line the Infernal Four are. OR OR...could she have a harem of 8? Maybe once Serai's mind magics are cleared we'll find out if the former friends are Micai's mates. !<

**Problems:**

This book is far from perfect.  Micai spends A LOT of time with herself and not branching out attempting to befriend>! the one woman that she saved from the beast attack!<.  We did get an olive branch to work with, but maybe more could have been done.  However, Micai spending time training and gaining strength fits with her personality.  If you've spent your entire life being hated by everyone around you, THEN spent the last 6-8 years in a prison fighting for your life that would warp someones ability to make and maintain friendships. Hopefully we'll see Micai gain a few friends, >!more than just the Infernal Four.!<

There's also weird switches of POV's.  This is a multiple POV story, but the switches come at odd places.

Some minor plot holes haven't been explained yet.>! Micai has some new marks on her body (especially around her ankle), yet towards the end of the book, no one says anything about them.  Her dress is described as being “floor length” so that would cover a lot of her legs  but maybe no one has noticed the marks in the forest because of THAT MOTHER EFFING CLIFF HANGER.!<

Micai never >!went to the library to investigate her powers, the marks on her body or any powers that Serai may be emitting.!<

I REALLY hope that >!Gadriel!< doesn't become one of Micai's mates.  I'm not getting a strong bond with him.  Also, I'm soooo over the ONE guy in any harem who is like “I hate her because.”  >!Hopefully Creed gets over his pissiness and gets with the program.!<

**In conclusion:**

There's so much mystery in this universe, with the sisters and with the fated mates that I am so excited to read book 2.  Davon managed to write a story where the bullied fights back and not with ""sassyness"" but with actual strength.  PLUS --- this story develops over 3 - 4 months which I like.  Most why choose/fated mate stories are all like, a week long before every lives happily ever after.  The slow progression was such a breath of fresh air.

Read the fucking book. It's so good.

e6aaos,(Almost) Every Romance TV and Movie Adaptation in the Works,"UPDATED! 12/5/2019

Last week, [Tor.com](http://tor.com/) did an [article](https://www.tor.com/2019/11/25/almost-every-sci-fi-fantasy-tv-or-movie-adaptation-in-the-works-right-now/) on every SFF adaptation in the works and I thought “why not do this for Romance?”

jjqih6,Best Romance Books of the Decade (2010-2019) according to r/RomanceBooks,"This is it. This for real, is the Grand Poobah and the culmination of everyone looking up their favorite books, only to find out they were published in 2008 or 2009! Prepare yourself for a long post with many links. And I sincerely apologize for the length. Strap in, it's gonna be long!

First off, thank you to everyone who participated, by either nominating and/or voting in our ***Best of the Decade Romance*** ***books*** poll. Below you will find the top three (and in some cases the top one) books in every category polled.

Descriptions of books are linked to Goodreads, and not included here as the post became too long. Quoted text is from the person who nominated the book as to why they felt it should be one of the best.

For a quick look at all books nominated you can find the spreadsheet I used to track [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ysPxK4RO85-3ZrzE_Y6j3VI0vMLkXl9qxq943bxH8_w/edit#gid=0).

**Best Fantasy Romance** - [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/hnk5ov/best_romaces_of_the_decade_20102019/)

***1st Place***: [A Court of Mist and Fury by Sarah J. Maas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17927395-a-court-of-mist-and-fury), 2016; *YA, M/F, Open door;* nominated by u/failedsoapopera

>Why I love this book so much:  
>  
>\*It deals with real mental health issues within an interesting \&amp; rich fantasy world&gt  
>  
>\*The chemistry between the main characters is on point  
>  
>\*It has so many favorite tropes: friends to lovers, fated mates, there's only one bed!, training montages, etc.  
>  
>\*Watching Feyre find self worth, power, and purpose, as well as friendship and love is just so healing for me  
>  
>\*It straddles the line between NA and regular fantasy, but I think it deserves a place in the fantasy contest because it was widely loved, made an impact on the romance world when it was released, and while there are some technical issues with SJM's writing IMO, it's a well-crafted, fun, and heartwarming story. Plus, it's got a great cliffhanger.

***2nd Place***: [Radiance by Grace Draven](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24473763-radiance?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=IpFSeUwkoi&rank=2), 2015; *M/F, open door;* nominated by u/Hrylla

>This book fits so many of the things I personally like  
>  
>\*Friends-to-lovers  
>  
>\*Altar diplomacy (arranged marriage)  
>  
>\*Strong heroine  
>  
>\*""Ugly"" hero  
>  
>\*Besides that the pace and story just flows so nicely. Being a sucker for world building I also thoroughly enjoyed myself (that weird dish where she had to kill the pie? Great!).  
>  
>\*It also features such swoon worth quotes as: *""Woman of day,"" he said slowly. ""You mean everything to me.”*

***3rd Place***: [Uprooted by Naomi Novik](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22544764), 2015, *YA, M/F, Close Door*; nominated by u/SphereMyVerse

>To be quite honest I’m nominating this one cos it was one of the first  fantasy romances I read, and I think it needs to be here! It was a huge hit at the time. It’s the classic immortal hero with deeply ridiculous  name meets and is awful to a feisty young woman, who gives as good as  she gets despite the weird power dynamic. It‘s a go-to rec for a newbie  to fantasy romance.  
>  
>Also it should have been F/F, Kasia and Agnieszka had way more chemistry, Sarkan was just tolerable some of the time, thank you for  listening to my TED talk

**Best Debut Novel:** [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/hrqwce/best_romance_books_of_the_decade_20102019_debut/)

***1st Place***: [The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36199084-the-kiss-quotient), 2018; *CR, M/F, Open Door, Own Voices;* nominated by u/nmnenado

>An obvious nomination and continuous top rec on the sub. This book  gender-flips the Pretty Woman trope and gets points for featuring racial- and neuro-diversity, no-shame sex work, a sweet love story, and  super steamy sex.

***2nd Place***: [Bringing Down the Duke by Evie Dunmore](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43521785-bringing-down-the-duke?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Q7TzhellYW&rank=1), 2019; *HR, M/F, Open Door*; nominated by u/Yellowtail799

>Annabelle Archer, the brilliant  destitute daughter of a country vicar, meets Sebastian Devereux, the  cold and calculating Duke of Montgomery. She has earned a place at  Oxford, rare as she is one of the first female students, and it is  dependent upon her support of women's suffrage. He is looking for a  wife, not an outspoken commoner who may upset his political position. Love ensues.  
>  
>Quality Points:  historically rich; the problem that separates them from being together  is actually dealt with (not waved away) in a way that makes sense.

**3rd Place**: [The Hating Game by Sally Thorne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25883848-the-hating-game?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=86WAI1TPGB&rank=1), 2016; *CR, M/F, Open Door*; nominated by u/expatb

>This book took contemporary romance  by storm and skyrocketed Sally Thorne to stardom. She created a great  enemies to lovers story with >!a secretly pining hero!< that was hard to resist for many a reader. Including me! I loved Lucy and Josh and the sweetness that developed between them.  
>  
>This  book was so popular and well liked that many (including me) had such  high expectations for her second novel that there was no way she could  live up to it and the book fell flat. To this day, The Hating Game is  one of the most recommended CR, enemies to lovers book out there.

**Best Historical - Medieval** - [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/hvukb5/best_romance_books_of_the_decade_20102019/)

***1st Place***: [Never Seduce a Scot by Maya Banks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13360101-never-seduce-a-scot), 2012; *M/F, Open Door*; nominated by u/seantheaussie

No reason given.

***2nd Place***: [Agnes Moor's Wild Knight by Alyssa Cole](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23674576-agnes-moor-s-wild-knight?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=XOIWEsEWrY&rank=1), 2014; *M/F, Open Door*; nominated by u/expatb

>I think that there is a real talent  to tell a story in a shorter format, and Alyssa Cole is mastering that  with her novellas. Her ability to have a set-up, build a relationship,  have a nice level of steam and have me buy in to it all in 50 pages, is  something to be lauded.  
>  
>I loved  this novella about Agnes, who is a black courtier in James IV court. I  felt that there was a real connection between Agnes and the Wild Knight,  which is a switch for me, as someone who doesn't like short timelines, or insta-love. But it really worked for me. I loved that her Highlander had come for her - it was HOT.  
>  
>I  also really enjoyed the uniqueness of having a black character in that  setting. In reality, they existed, but we don't see them too often in  books and the fact that she is present and has a mind and is basically a  diplomat for James made me really like Agnes and this story.

***3rd Place:*** [Far, Bright, and Terrible by Elizabeth Kingston](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34014130-fair-bright-and-terrible?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=3wu1fCwKtV&rank=1), 2017; *M/F, Open Door*; nominated by u/SaMnReader

>I could have nominated any of this  series. Kingston takes difficult characters and has believable growth  through the book. This one was very emotional, taking a character that  was loathed and felt irredeemable in the prior book and giving her a  love story to end all love stories. The hero is a teddy bear, the  heroine is a manipulative, powerful force made so by her excellent  backstory. The story reckons with the girl she was and the woman she  became-and the hero loving her for it all.  
>  
>And Nick Boulton reads the audio.

**Best LGBTQI Books** - [Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/i18jer/best_romance_books_of_the_decade_20102019_lgbtqi/)

***1st Place***: [Red, White and Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41150487-red-white-royal-blue?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=CVr2kcmuXS&rank=1), 2019; *CR, M/M, Open Door*; nominated by u/arsenal_kate

>It’s just so incredibly charming and sweet. It’s perfect escapism, both on the relationship level and on the political level.

***2nd Place***: [Glitterland by Alexis Hall](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25638048-glitterland), 2013; *CR, M/M*; nominated by u/eros_bittersweet

>A highly-educated writer with bipolar  disorder is smitten at first sight with a skinny-jeans-wearing,  glitterly-epauletted Essex lad. They have a flirtation in which Ash, the  writer, castigates himself for the attraction he feels towards Darian,  who he initially thinks is as brainless as he is unapologetically tacky: ""Hunjad Pacent!"" But all is not what it seems. During their initial  hookup Darian is thoughtful and caring, beyond what one would expect of a  one-night-stand, and he expresses interest in dating Ash. As their relationship progresses, he demonstrates that he is the better person of  the two and that he is good for Ash in every way: he brings him down to  earth, he forces him to think of others. His every action, from cooking  him dinner to bringing him timely wet-wipes, is thoughtful and demonstrative of his care. But Ash's obstacles to love are many, and all  of them are within himself. He must overcome his own prejudices against  Darian's background, and his personal demons, which tell him he does  not deserve love, to be the partner Darian deserves.  
>  
>A very modern story about pride and prejudice, this book is, in my  opinion, just in another class of storytelling. Not only is Ash's  prejudice against Darian a theme, but so is our own prejudice as the reader, in (most likely) assuming Ash is the more worthy man of the two. In Ash's metaphorically laden internal monologues, which are wildly  creative, his imagery quite often becomes overwrought and  disproportionate to the events and things described. Doubt creeps in  gradually: is Ash, so very intelligent and privileged, not sometimes  just as absurd as Darian can be, if not more so? Isn't Darian, Essex  Salt-of-the-Earth, actually a lovely person; his goodness, emotional  intelligence and instinctive sense of rightness just as worthy of our  esteem as Ash's cleverness? Alexis Hall's intensely immersive  first-person narrative tells a love story that also makes us question  our own prejudices. And as the book unfolds, we judge each of the heroes  less for their ways of expressing themselves.  By the end of the book, I  found I was unable to be amused at Ash's hyperbole when I understood  how much pain lurked behind it, and understood that Darian's absurdities  mattered far less than his good heart.  
>  
>Ash's burdensome inner life is a heartbreaking picture of bipolar disorder. This is a book that does not use mental illness to force drama upon the  plot: one of the most affective moments of the book is when Ash builds a  simple trip to the grocery store into a psychological crisis. His  actions, though they stem from his illness, are often selfish, yet we  see how much it hurts him to carry them out, how much he loathes himself  for things done out of a sense of self-preservation. Importantly, he  does not need to become perfect or healed to win Darian's love: he must merely accept himself as deserving of it.  
>  
>It's a wonderful, thematically rich book with a beautiful love story as its heart.

***3rd Place***: [The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11250317-the-song-of-achilles?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=8D7AHiolgV&rank=1), 2011; *HR, M/M, Closed Door*; nominated by u/expatb

>This book is beautifully written. Miller's prose and the fact that she  is a high school classics teacher as her main job helps with the  intimate knowledge she has of the Iliad and the time period, which shines through in her storytelling. She fills in the blanks left by  Homer in his epic poem and creates such a believable love story between Patroclus and Achilles. This book was great.

**Best Contemporary Novel** - [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/i5gy2u/best_romance_books_of_the_decade_20102019/)

>I think this book deserves to win because it was unique and very sexy. I  loved the hero and the way this book treated both autism and sex work. I  can’t think of another book that made me sigh and swoon the way TKQ did.

***2nd Place***: [Get a Life, Chloe Brown by Talia Hibbert](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43884209-get-a-life-chloe-brown), 2019; *M/F, Open Door*; nominated by u/expatb

>This was the first book I had ever read by Hibbert and what an introduction! This book blew me away with  the humor, the steam, and the representation of people with illnesses  that aren’t immediately apparent. They way that she handles both  characters and their issues so deftly and weaves them into the story is  amazing and set the bar (high) for me. Red became instant book boyfriend  material. And Chloe was someone I really wanted to get to know and hang out with.  
>  
>I enjoyed it so much, that immediately after I read it, I sent it to a few of my friends for them to read.

***3rd Place***: [Pretty Face by Lucy Parker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30631124-pretty-face?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=nhHpc4dwt0&rank=4), 2017; *M/F, Open Door;* nominated by u/1RexManningFan

>\*Both characters are genuinely likable   
>  
>\*Slow burn romance. You know it's inevitable, the characters know it's inevitable, but they try to resist   
>  
>\*Obstacles to HEA are not contrived. Feels realistic and again, characters are aware of their issues but work around them   
>  
>\*Unique setting - London theatre world

***1st Place***: [Clean Sweep by Ilona Andrews](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19090384), 2013; M/F; nominated by u/expatb

>This was the first book that I read by Andrews and it was fantastic. I loved the slow burn and the alternate universe that they created. A house that is magical and tied to the witch who keeps it? Yes, please. While I don’t tend to favor vampires and werewolves, I really enjoyed  the ones in this book! If that doesn’t make it the greatest, nothing  will.

***2nd Place***: [Burn for Me by Ilona Andrews](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20705702-burn-for-me), 2011; M/F; nominated by u/Scavengerhawk

>This book/series is one of a kind. A kickass heroine who LOVES her family and respects herself. The Hero is  intimidating and powerful but respects her, listens to her, relies on  her knowledge/power when they pair up. It's a slow burn with a lot of  character development. You fall in love with her quirky grandmother and  her war-veteran mother. She always strives to do the right thing and is  true to herself.  
>  
>Amazing plot, amazing story, and the perfect slow-burn with just enough banter/flirting.

***3rd Place***: [Once Burned by Jeaniene Frost](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7039218-once-burned?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=rsAD7whtTE&rank=1), 2012; *M/F, Open Door*; nominated by  u/Needednewusername

>I believe this book should win because both characters have powers that  make the other more vulnerable than they had ever been in the past, and  that vulnerability leads to a truly beautiful love story!

***2nd Place***: [Duke of Sin by Elizabeth Hoyt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26804433), 2016; *M/F, Open Door*; nominated by u/mirukushake

>\*The hero of this book is a uniquely mercurial, vain, and cunning villain, without being an asshole

>\*One of the darkest hero backstories this side of the 2000s

***3rd Place***:  [When Beauty Tamed the Beast by Eloisa James](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8449698), 2011; *M/F, Open Door*; nominated by u/mirukushake

>\*House M.D., but make it Georgian and add some beauty and the beast vibes   
>  
>\*The characters act in very ridiculous and anachronistic ways, but their banter is so hilariously snarky it works anyway   
>  
>\*The MCs actually spend time together and get to know each other in real  ways, and the ending of the book beautifully shows just how deep their feelings are

***1st Place***: [A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16096824), 2015; *FR, M/F, open door*; nominated by u/expatb

>I feel like Maas almost  singlehandedly created the “New Adult” genre. She certainly did for me. This book creates such a beautiful - and hot! - story that gaps that  younger reader to adult reader so seamlessly. Plus, it’s a Beauty and the Beast retelling, which is one of my absolute favorites. I thought Feyre was such an interesting heroine and I enjoyed reading about her journey and her ability to take on some very tough situations.  
>  
>With how much I enjoyed this one, maybe I’ll finally read the follow up books someday!

***2nd Place:*** [The Deal by Elle Kennedy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24920901-the-deal?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=umNedL6GWm&rank=1), 2015; *CR, M/F, Open Door*; nominated by u/urchicken

>This book is such a great introductory book into the New Adult genre. I  love the banter between the two MCs. I love that they established a  friendship before jumping into bed together. This book was light hearted  and fun with just a touch of angst. Also the hero is a hot hockey  player, who doesn’t love that?

***3rd Place***:  [Autoboyography by Christina Lauren](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28919058-autoboyography?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=mv2rwgDrjz&rank=1), 2017; *CR, M/M;* nominated by u/booksandwine99

>This is a YA m/m romance. It's senior  year of high school, and Tanner is a bisexual non-mormon living in  Provo, Utah (an area with 98% mormon population). He can't wait to get  out of there, and has no plans on meeting anyone in Utah. Then BYU  college student Sebastian TA's in his creative writing class and sparks  fly. The problem is, Sebastian is a poster boy for devout mormonism and  is leaving on a two year mission for the church in a few short months.  
>  
>I  may have loved this more because I am an ex-mormon, but I still  reccomend it even if you don't have any knowledge of mormon culture.  Christina or Lauren either have history with the church or they did  their research because it is spot on. I liked the characters and it had  just the right amount of conflict and angst.

[Tempest by Miss Beverly Jenkins](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068495-tempest), 2018; *M/F, Open Door*; nominated by u/grumpyblonde

>This book was my first foray into Beverly Jenkins and I loved it! This  book has an independent, adventurous heroine (who is a crack shot btw)  and a closed-off grumpy hero who mourning the death of his wife and trying to raise their daughter. The characters build a friendship, learn  to communicate and bring out the best in each other. Regan, the  heroine, updates the hero's outdated views about women. The book delves  into the challenges of being black in the US in the 1800s and complex family dynamics. Their daughter is so precious and the main characters have some great chemistry!

>I've  been waiting for what feels like forever for this thread! This book is  seriously worthy of awards. It's amazing. Coming close to 1000 pages, it  has everything. Humans crash landing on an alien planet. Aliens (of  course). The writing is wonderful. The world building...wow. The story  is just amazing.

>In the words of Stefon, this book has  everything. A found family space crew! Space class differences between a  space aristocrat hero and a scrappy, badass underdog heroine! That  heroine using the hero's temporary amnesia to force him to act as her  servant and position *her* as the aristocrat instead! Naked cuddling for warmth! And so, so much more.  
>  
>Truly,  this book scratches every Sci-Fi romance itch for me. Beautiful yet  approachable world-building, fantastic characters, a great supporting  cast, and of course, a heart-throbbing romance that's good until ""And  they lived happily ever after.""

>A book that for me, comes down to  moments. There isn't one particular thing in this book that I can point  to and say ""that,"" but the way the arc is constructed, the lack of  sacrifice on the part of the heroine, and a hero who ultimately just  loves her as she is for who she is. The fact that Robert has some of the  best lines does not hurt, including ""Look up,""  Minnie is introverted,  and assertive, and is certainly no ""mouse"".  I love a heroine who  believe she deserves more than the plan and course her life is taking  and despite it being hard, she decides to change it. Robert is a hero  and a character who is ideal but not without flaws, he's someone to  aspire to.

>A most unusual and heartbreaking  romance, never easy. It would be easy to reduce this to a romance about a  guy who cheats on his wife and woman who stupidly waits for his husband  to love her and see her.  
>  
>Only  see, that's not what this is. That's barely a part of the plot even  though this discussion dominates low ratings. I submit, instead, this is  a book of a man and a woman not given a choice in their partners and  learning how to live with it. This is unrequited love and friends to  lovers. This is about who you grow to be and reconciling your past with  your present.

>Here is part of my review:
>won't recap, but I'll definitely say in many ways this isn't an easy  read. And it would be easy to malign Fitz for his choices and seemingly  constant rejection of Millie, but part of why this book worked was that  he, too, was rejected time and again by her.  I'm not sure why he'd  think anything but what he thought, and his appreciation of her really  did ring true from the very early 'bricks' of their relationship. He  maintains respect, honesty, and friendship for his wife in a lovely way.  
>  
>And friendship is such a lovely foundation, isn't it? I think the choices in this book were brave and made for a unique plot. It  would be easy to have Fitz hung up on his long forgotten lover but  Thomas made her available to him, and in the end that's what set this  book apart.

***3rd Place:***  [Love in the Afternoon by Lisa Kleypas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7491418-love-in-the-afternoon?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=SG2Z5QwUfK&rank=1), 2010; *M/F, Open Door;* nominated by u/expatb

>This is one of my favorite books by  her. And I think I've re-read it as many times as I have read my other  favorites by Kleypas, which is saying something since the others were  published 15 years prior. I absolutely adored the epistolary, Cyrano  feel to the beginning of the book. It set up everything so beautifully.

>I think this is one of the first historical romances that I read that dealt with >!PTSD after a war!<. I thought it was handled really well. It wasn't cured by a magical vagina, nor some crackpot remedy. It was work and patience.

**Best Erotic Romance** - [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/izh2m0/best_romance_books_of_the_decade_20102019_best/)

***1st Place***: [Priest by Sierra Simone,](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25507389-priest?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=n0OwPqWJZ0&rank=2) 2015; *CR, M/F*; nominated by u/canquilt

>This book is elegant, deep, and sexy.  Simone gives the main character a  crisis of conscience and forces him to choose between personal  happiness and his religious community.  She weaves theological aspects  with sexual ones and does it very artfully.  The sex scenes themselves  are absolutely out of this world.

***2nd Place***:  [Desperate Measures by Katee Robert](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44323708-desperate-measures?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=X5rPTGWc75&rank=1), 2019; *M/F, CR;* nominated by u/expatb

>Wow, this book packs a punch! This  was the first book I've read by Katee Robert and it knocked me upside  the head and then pushed me around. I honestly went into this book  thinking I wasn't going to like it because I didn't want my childhood to  be destroyed.  Who knew I wanted Jasmine and Jafar together? Who knew  that a sex club run by Hades would be fascinating? (Seriously, though,  he's really the only one who could run this club!). And Whoooo-boy was  this book hot! It has since spawned six books in the same universe.  
>  
>Robert  knows how to keep the focus so close, in that there's not a lot of  external factors, or movement. So much of the plot takes place in an  apartment, but it doesn't feel claustrophobic for a minute. That takes  talent. And Katee Robert has it.

***3rd Place (tie)***: [For Real by Alexis Hall](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25376011-for-real?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=3LwMq2FueQ&rank=1), 2018; *CR, M/M*; nominated by u/jrooknroll

>This book is both sexy and sweet. The writing is incredible. I think this is Hall’s best work.

Added thoughts by u/eros_bitersweet
>The erotica is absolutely central to  the relationship and drives its progression.  Firstly, the expected  personas of the dom and sub are completely swapped: Laurie is the half  of the partnership powerful IRL with his job in medicine, while Toby is  the young, relatively innocent side of the couple who is finding his  path in life. In one scene of the novel, Toby really does need Laurie to  take charge of a chaotic situation at work, so he can get through it  without quitting. And yet Toby is perfectly capable of rubbing shoulders  with the educated crowd at Oxford and feeling comfortable, more able to  charm them and impress them than Laurie with his knowledge and talent.  Who you are in the outside world does not dictate how you experience  desire and intimacy.  
>  
>It's also not  just that the kink illustrates what the characters want: the BDSM in  this book is also about how they exchange vulnerability. This novel is  really about the experience of vicarious desire. Individual longing for  the other is layered on top of anticipation of the other's desire, then  satisfaction at seeing that desire experienced, a dynamic which zings  back and forth between the pair, giving and taking and giving, until it  culminates in an overabundance of both feeling and erotic experience.[*comment continues here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/izh2m0/best_romance_books_of_the_decade_20102019_best/g6jkpdm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) *(shortened for overall post length)*

***3rd Place (tie)***: [The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36199084-the-kiss-quotient?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=fFfeVHR99U&rank=1), 2018; *CR, M/F;* nominated by u/seantheaussie

>THE most popular romance book of the past few years who's appeal is  based upon its heat. You know full well that even though you are not on  the spectrum like Stella, you wish Michael was servicing you.

**Historical - General -** Only one nomination, no thread.

[The Haunting of Maddy Clare by Simone St. James,](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11832043) 2012; *M/F, open door*; nominated by u/DancingMarshmallow

>I’m nominating this because, while including some paranormal/ghost story  elements, it has such lovely attention to detail and its setting of  1920s England: the clothes, the cars, the technology, WWI, the changing  culture (especially women entering the work force in more ways). I also  love that it uses the setting in a non-stereotypical way. Yes, this is  the Roaring 20s, but no gangsters or flappers to be had here. And the  setting matters, which I think is important in HR. The basic plot could  happen in another time, but the setting isn’t just window dressing here:  it influences how our characters act and think. *chef’s kiss*

***1st Place:***  [Tinderbox by Rachel Grant](https://www.goodreads.com/series/197192-flashpoint), 2017; *CR, M/F, Open Door;* nominated by u/expatb

>This was the first book that I read  by Grant, based on a recommendation from this sub and it did not  disappoint! I absolutely love reading about capable heroes and heroines.  I also love when an author shows their intelligence on a topic and I  fell that Grant’s experience as an archaeologist in the horn of Africa  is apparent in this book. Talk about competence porn!

kejs79,Villain has a soft spot for the Heroine/Hero?,"I'm so close to winter break and I'm super excited to be able to get some free time and read some books!  :>

I was thinking about this trope and I was wondering if anyone knows of any F/M romance recommendations where:

\- The FMC and MMC are on opposing sides seeking to destroy each other.

\- The villian can either be the female main character or the male main character, but they grow to care about the safety of the hero/heroine and doesn't want to see them hurt or feels conflicted when they are

I think the Winner's Curse series would fit this, and if anyone plays otome games, I was really interested in Varg from Cinderella Phenomenon (he serves the enemy side but hates to see the MC hurt by his superior). I also played Fallen Hero Rebirth (interactive novel) and I absolutely loved the idea where the MC is a villain but had some kind of past connection with the hero and can't stop caring about him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/kejs79/villain_has_a_soft_spot_for_the_heroinehero/,2020-12-16T22:36:32Z,9,30,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

14n4med,Goodreads put out a list of Readers Top 100 Romances of the last 3 years,"[HERE is the list](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/2534?ref=rom23top100_eb).

Do you agree with the list?  

Do you notice any books that are missing that you think should be on the list? 

How many of the books on this list have you read?

Which books on this list would you personally recommend?

My initial thoughts: I'm surprised how much contemporary is on this list, compared to historical.  It seems like some authors are pretty overrepresented on this list, but then again I've only read 5 of the books here so what do I know. Maybe they are really just that good? 

I don't see any representation for Sci Fi? And very few representations for fantasy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/14n4med/goodreads_put_out_a_list_of_readers_top_100/,2023-06-30T16:09:35Z,68,120,RomanceBooks,The Hating Game,POST

mj6d1z,"Welcome to r/RomanceBooks! This is the Masterpost of Rules, Norms, Help, and Links!","**Welcome to** [**r/RomanceBooks**](https://www.reddit.com/r/romancebooks/)**!**

This is a post to welcome our new users and familiarize our old users with some of the rules, community norms, and helpful hints for using Reddit.

**The purpose of this subreddit is to discuss romance novels, the genre in general, and romance-adjacent topics!** What it is not: a subreddit for writing advice; a place to advertise your book, blog, podcast, etc., or get beta-readers; a Wiki-like resource for romance books in general.

For our purposes, we'll use the Romance Writers of America's **definition of the romance novel**: ""Two basic elements comprise every romance novel: a central love story and an emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending."" [1](https://www.rwa.org/Online/Romance_Genre/About_Romance_Genre.aspx)

Rules

These rules have been created over time, and are all there for a reason. They are also located in the sidebar, should you need a refresher. Your post or comment can be removed for breaking a rule, at the mods’ discretion.

&#x200B;

* **No self-promotion outside the seasonal thread**
   * [r/RomanceBooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/)is a place to discuss romance novels, not to sell them. As such, we request that all book promoting is kept to the seasonal thread.

&#x200B;

* **Be kind & no book shaming**
   * You can critique a book without insulting people who like it. Also, we will not tolerate discrimination based on gender, sexuality, race- anything.
   * We want to keep this subreddit feeling like a small community, so be nice to one another. Don't assume the worst of people.
   * Also, be polite. A friendly message in your request thread will work better than a blank one after the title or one that just says ""give me hate-to-love books"". Engage with the commenters who reply. They are giving their time to help you with your request.

&#x200B;

* **No discrimination, bigotry, or microaggressions towards marginalized groups**
* We want [r/RomanceBooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/) to be a safe place for all.  Racism, anti-queer bigotry, and any other discrimination are prohibited here, along with microaggressions like invalidation, denial or derailment.

&#x200B;

* **Make the title of the request specific & provide details when asking for recommendations.**

Write a post with an informative title and in your post body include one or more of the following:

1. similar books/authors
2. specific scenes/tropes/subgenres
3. relevant info as to why you want to read this type of book

**Examples of book requests that will get removed:**

· *""Recommend a book like The Hating Game""*

· *""More Enemies to Lovers""*

· *""Witty Banter""*

· *""Tiny FMCs""*

**Example of an approvable book request:**

*""I really enjoyed The Hating Game because of the witty banter. I want to read more contemporary romance enemies-to-lovers recs, but I didn't like the size differences between the characters, nor do I like billionaire romances. What do you recommend?""*

&#x200B;

* **No piracy**
   * Do not post links to, reference how to access, or request creative work that has not been authorized by the rights holder, including but not limited to YouTube videos of audiobooks/movies, PDFs of books, blogs whose content is books, etc.
   * Any external link to original content must either be on the creator’s own site or properly attributed.
   * Fair use of copyrighted material is allowed.

&#x200B;

*  **Warn us about non-HEA books** 
   * The [definition](https://www.rwa.org/Online/Romance_Genre/About_Romance_Genre.aspx#The_Basics) of a romance novel is a love story that ends in a happily ever after (HEA) or happy for now (HFN).
   * People come to this sub expecting that all books or series mentioned here end in HEA, unless informed otherwise.
   * Non HEA and non HFN romances are still welcome to be discussed here but you MUST warn users when doing so, unless the OP specifically mentioned that they are ok with non-HEA romance.

&#x200B;

* **Mark your spoilers**
   * See below in the ""helpful hints"" to make sure you're doing this properly.

&#x200B;

* **Memes go in the ""Meme Monday Megathread""**
   * We have some hilarious members, but were concerned the memes were starting to take over, so we have a special place for them now.
   * You can use memes or TikToks in the *comments* section of a post.

&#x200B;

* **If you’re new to Reddit and want to make a post:**

o Your account must be at least 3 days old and have 25 karma points.

&#x200B;

Community Norms

* **Small community feel** \- We are big community and growing every day, but as mods we are still invested in keeping this place feeling like a smaller community. Make friends, tag each other in posts, participate in the regular threads!
* **Avoiding off-topic debates/arguments** \- We don’t want to have a blanket rule like “no politics”- if we can stick to being respectful and not getting totally off topic, we can still discuss things like politics and deeper issues within the framework of book discussion. We just ask our users to be respectful of everyone's views.
* **Reporting broken rules/people trying to stir shit up** \- Don’t be shy about reporting people/posts/comments. Most of our rules are simply organizational/technical, so it’s not about shaming someone.
* **Try searching first.** We get a lot of request threads, and some members tire of reading ""please recommend (example trope) for me!!"" posts 3x a day, when just yesterday we had a robust discussion about (example trope). See the helpful hints section on how to search.
* **If you have ideas or thoughts on something to improve the subreddit,** especially if you want to help implement it yourself, feel free to message the mods!

Helpful Hints

**Spoiler tags**

Before and after your spoiler, use a > and a ! right up against the words. So it’ll look like this:

\>!spoiler here!<

* New reddit also has a spoiler button, so that’s easier.
   * For your spoiler to also work on, ""old reddit"" (which some of us use on computer), you need to remove the space between the start of the spoiler, and the start of the text being concealed.
   * If you applied the spoiler using a button while on a computer, either press the ""markdown mode"" button and follow the instructions above, or highlight the offending spoiler, press the spoiler button to remove it, re-highlight the spoiler **being careful not to highlight the space before the beginning of the text** and press the spoiler button. If you are on a computer, you can check to see if your fix worked by typing >old. in front of reddit in the address bar. e.g. [old.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks](http://old.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks)

**How to search using Google**

* Go to Google, write site:reddit.com before your search
* Example: site:reddit.com/[r/romancebooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/romancebooks/) friends to lovers gives [this result](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03fP3Awsira6VNNYLHvTIs96w_dWw%3A1592924230849&source=hp&ei=RhjyXr2SMOSoytMP4I-n0AI&q=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Fromancebooks+friends+to+lovers&oq=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Fromancebooks+friends+to+lovers&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1DqCVjqCWDADWgAcAB4AIABLogBLpIBATGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwi9zbiXmZjqAhVklHIEHeDHCSoQ4dUDCAk&uact=5). Much better than what you get if you use the Reddit search function. That thing often just sucks.
* You can also find the Google search button on the sidebar ---->

**How to tag others in your comments**

* Simply write u/ followed by the username. Ex: [u/mrs-machino](https://www.reddit.com/u/mrs-machino/)

**Goodreads bot instructions**

* Don’t want to find the Goodreads link on your own? There is an awesome new bot in town. Just use { } around the title/title and author of your book and they’ll respond with a link to the Goodreads page. Ex: {Get a Life, Chloe Brown}
* This only works in comments.

**How post flairs works**

* Each post should have some kind of tag to make it easy for our users to find what they’re looking for. Recommendation requests get “Book Request”. If you’re looking for a specific title, “What was that book called…?” etc. If you’re typing on the computer, there’s a button below your post that says “Flair” and you can choose the most pertinent tag.
* On mobile, it's right under your title.
* You cannot make the post without using a flair.

**How user flairs work (How do I get that gray box next to my username that says something funny?)**

* On mobile, make sure you are on the homepage of the sub. Look at the top right corner where there are 3 dots. Select “Change user flair.” Pick one you like, or use the first one that says it’s editable if you have your own idea.
* On PC: On the right side of the sub, there’s a small description of the subreddit. Click “Community options” under that and you can pick your flair there.

18k6jgr,What does the vanilla ice cream line mean in Pnin by Vladimir Nabokov?,"Hello, very amateur reader here! I have just finished Pnin by Vladimir Nabokov._x000D_  
_x000D_  
As I understood it, Pnin's relationship with Victor is meant to signify hope and optimism for the future. Even if Victor doesn't fit Pnin's initial ""preconception"" of him (for example, Pnin buys Victor a soccer ball, but discovers in the quote below that Victor does not like soccer), Pnin and Victor still grow a bond much stronger than Victor's bond with his actual father. I thought this message lined up very nicely with the last scene, where Pnin reclaims his agency from the ""past"" by leaving Waindell. _x000D_  
_x000D_  
So that leads me to a question about this following quote: 

>_x000D_  
'I'm afraid I don't care much for football, In fact, I hate football. I'm not very good at any game, really,'   
>  
>_x000D_  
'You are not a lover of football?' said Pnin, and a look of dismay crept over his large expressive face. He pursed his lips, He opened them - but said nothing. In silence he ate his vanilla ice-cream, which contained no vanilla and was not made of cream.

_x000D_  
What does the last line even mean? Is Pnin eating, like, sour cream, and this is meant to be joke (which would make sense, since Pnin is a comedy)? Does this have some sort of literary significance that went over my head? But sour cream is still made of cream, and Nabokov says here that what Pnin was eating was not ""made of cream"", so what could it possibly be?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
Any help in deciphering this line would be appreciated. It might be obvious that I am an amateur reader. Thank you for taking the time to read! I also wasn't sure what sub to post this on, so if you have any suggestions for any other subs that might be helpful, I would also love to hear those.",https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/18k6jgr/what_does_the_vanilla_ice_cream_line_mean_in_pnin/,2023-12-17T01:59:41Z,8,21,literature,The Hating Game,POST
yhdjgg,The Glass Bead as an Expansion of the conventional game of Chess,"In his eponymous novel, Hermann Hesse prophesied The Glass Bead Game, described as ""a much more complex version of chess"", and ""requiring years of study in mathematics, music, and history; play proceeds when players make conceptual connections between topics that seem unrelated on the surface.""

However, ""the rules of the game are only alluded to - they are so sophisticated that they are not easy to imagine.""

Finally, the Glass Bead Game, as prophesied by Hermann Hesse, has actually manifested! Check it out!!!

**The Glass Bead Game as an Expansion of the conventional game of Chess**

**by**

**Hermann Hesse and Saul Célere**

**Exerted from “Chess, Love, and The Coming of World Peace”**

*“L'avenir appartient à ceux qui croient en la beauté de leurs rêves”*

One day I was walking to or from my mom's house when I suddenly saw in my mind’s eye, a young, light brown, slightly orange hart. A hart is an animal like a deer, but smaller I think, I'm not too sure. 

It was very beautiful and quietly majestic. But it was in pain and couldn't walk freely. There was a loop of barbed wire tightly wrapped into the flesh of one of its hind legs. 

Just before I saw the hart I had been thinking about Chess, and particularly the rules of Chess, and I somehow realised that the hart herself was Chess, and that the barbed wire was what’s known as “the rule of draw by way of threefold repetition of position”  

This rule states that a chess match can be called a draw if a particular configuration of all the pieces on the board is repeated three times. 

This rule makes a lot of practical sense; obviously a game isn't developing in an interesting way if the same position keeps on being repeated, and this rule prevents players repeating the same position indefinitely. 

We can see the petty origins of this rule; a player in an otherwise totally losing position finds a sequence of forcing moves that begin and end in the same position, or a sequence of moves that force his opponent to either repeat the sequence or to move into a losing position.

This rule is a testament to how much we hate losing at Chess. There’s nothing a Chess player hates more than losing, and we’d all rather repeat a position eternally than move into a losing position, especially if until then we had been winning.                                                      

However, despite its practical utility, this rule robs Chess of Her Infinity. 

Assuming the rule of threefold repetition the number of possible chess games is very large, but finite. It is said that there are more possible games of Chess than there are stars in our Universe. 

Very impressive. However, as soon as we revoke the rule of threefold repetition, the number of possible games immediately becomes infinitely larger, by becoming equal to Infinity Herself. **Ex. 1. Philosophico-linguistic Discussion questions. ( See end of essay for exercises )**

This is easy to see. For example, once we ignore threefold repetition, we can see an infinity of games even if both players only ever move one of their two knights. 

White could move one of his knights, and then the players agree to a draw is one possible game. Or, white could move a knight and then black move one of his knights and then agree to draw, is a second possible game. 

The players could repeatedly move only these two knights from their starting positions to one of the two squares available to them, and then back to the starting position, for any number of moves they wish, up to Infinity, before declaring a draw. 

And thus, Chess, in the absence of the rule of three fold repetition, and even only utilising two of the thirty-two pieces, generates an infinite number of possible games. 

Now let's say the players both slightly increase the complexity of their play by moving their respective knight to both of the possible squares it can move to from its starting position. 

Now two new and intimately related possibilities arise within the micro-universe of a Chess game. One is communication, and the other is computability.

Imagine two spies get locked up together and their captors were cruel enough to cut out their tongues, and yet kind enough to leave a chessboard in the cell for them. 

Well, if both the spies know Morse code, and any real spy surely would, then they can immediately begin talking to each other using just one of each of their knights. The knight moving from its starting position to the left corresponds to “dot”, and to the right signifies “dash”. ( After each “dot” or “dash” the knight needs one move to reset to its starting position. If the players use both of their knights there are more efficient ways of using Morse code without the need of any resetting moves. )  **Ex. 2.** 

Now every game our prisoners play is not only a possible, totally legal chess match, but also a record of one of their conversations. 

Chess has become meta-physical; it is capable of an extra layer of communicative significance outside of the limited physical world of the chessboard and the positions of the pieces.

In addition, this chess Morse code system is equivalent to a mechanical binary system, and, as such, it can be used by our spies as a Turing machine to run any piece of computer code, since all modern computers are equivalent to extremely fast Turing machines. **Ex. 3.**

Our prisoners’ chess-Turing machine, on the other hand, would be extremely slow. If the spies had some stolen code they wanted to run, the processing speed would be determined by how fast the spies can move their knights back and forth. If they wanted to run the code for a modern computer game, it would render a framerate of one frame every billion years or something like that. 

Now our spies have discovered the possibility of playing chess peacefully, with an objective other than trying to destroy the other side. 

It's remarkable how much the possibilities of chess expand once we change our conception of the game from one of war to one of Peace. 

Peaceful chess is the undiscovered, complimentary other half of conventional, bellicose Chess. As throughout history times of peace have brought about flourishings of art and literature, so in peaceful chess you can talk freely with your opponent, or recite Shakespeare together, albeit in Morse-code. 

The chessboard is the perfect stage for Hamlet; Two knights can be used to recite the play like an equestrian greek chorus, and at different points throughout the play, other pieces can be moved by way of legal chess moves into positions depicting scenes from the play, ending with Hamlet, the sweet prince playing the black king, resigning. 

And how would Buddha play chess? Well, there exists a subset of all possible Chess games we can call the **“Ahimsa set”**. “Ahimsa” is the Sanskrit word for “doing no harm” or “causing no suffering”. 

By definition, in all of these games neither black nor white ever capture a piece, and never give checkmate, so all Ahimsa games are either agreed draws or go on forever.

If no pieces are ever captured then all the pawns will remain on the board throughout all Ahimsa games. 

There exists a subset of Ahimsa games where no pawns ever move. In these games the pawns block in all the pieces except for the knights, who can frolic around the board as they wish. We have already seen some of the possibilities of such knight-only games.

Things become more interesting in Ahimsa games with some non-zero density of pawn moves. 

In games where no pieces, and therefore no pawns, are ever captured, only a finite number of pawn moves are possible before each pawn encounters, and is blocked by his opposite pawn. 

The smallest number of possible pawn moves until every pawn is next to his opposing pawn is where every pawn moves two squares on his first move. This requires a total of sixteen moves, one move per pawn, and it creates a natural and totally impenetrable wall of pawns in the centre of the board. **Ex. 4.**

Since this pawn wall is two squares deep, not even knights can cross it. The only possible way for any piece to ever cross this wall involves the capture of at least one pawn, and we’re only examining peaceful games where neither player ever captures a piece.

This is the first significant game of peaceful Chess; it is the first and most natural outbreak of peace in the Chess Universe, and is obviously very reminiscent of humans building a wall instead of going to war. 

As long as this pawn wall is maintained, both sides are totally isolated and safe from one another. As explained earlier, the two sides can now talk and perform for each other however they wish.

We can also see how a simple Morse code language might develop into a complete natural language. 

For example, let's say one of our prisoners is a fan of horses and likes to talk about horses all the time, and the other spy doesn't know him well enough yet to be able to say “Dude, seriously, enough about the horses already. This is bad enough as it is without having to listen to you banging on about horses all day, in Morse f%@king code no less”.  

Well, the horse fanatic will soon be fed up typing out the word “horse” in Morse code, and might explain to the other spy, “Look, I'm using this knight for Morse code with you, but please let it now be understood that whenever I make a move with my other knight, I mean that move to signify the word “horse”. 

Other pieces could also have meanings associated with them, and individual pieces could have more than one meaning associated with them, and which meaning you actually meant at any given time would be determined by the context of the surrounding conversation. 

So the queen could be used to signify “queen”, “mother”, “woman”, “daughter”, “moon”, “muon”, “feminine”, etc. at different points in the same conversation as the two prisoners become more fluent in the language they’re creating together. **Ex. 5.**

Different types of move could represent different word types. So, if the queen is moved diagonally she is signifying a verb, “to dance”, let's say, but if she moves horizontally a noun, and vertically an adjective. So, the sentence “The feminine queen danced” would involve three queen moves. Complete natural languages can be developed in such ways. **Ex. 6.**

This first peaceful game is what we might expect to see if two very immense intelligences encountered a chessboard and pieces for the first time together. 

To our two immense intelligences, the chessboard and the pieces immediately present themselves as both a game and a means of communication. And the nature of the chessboard and the pieces are likely to suggest a set of sets of natural rules for the game, and let's imagine they decide on exactly our terrestrial set of Chess rules minus, of course, the rule of threefold repetition. 

Let's also imagine that, for some mysterious cosmic reason, our two intelligences can only ever play one game. **Ex. 7.**

They won't want to squander their one and only game of chess, so they will think very carefully about their first moves. 

Then they notice that they can move both their knights as much as they want without irrevocably losing the starting position.   

As long as they don't move any other pieces, they can both move both of their knights as much as they want while preserving the possibility of returning to the starting position of chess, from which point they can begin a new conventional game of chess, and all this takes place within their original, one and only game! 

Now, instead of immediately attacking each other, opponents can discuss possibilities together before choosing Ahimsic ones as co-creators.

They notice the possibility of using their knights as the mechanism for binary computer processing. They can use their knights to run the binary computer code of a Chess engine program like “stockfish” to analyse the game of Chess generally in search of the best opening move.

This is very meta! The two intelligences are now using the very game of Chess they’re playing, to computationally analyse the game of chess generally, in search of the best opening move to play later when they start their game within a game!!! ( And again we can see Hamlet, this time plotting his “play within a play” )

During this pre-match thinking time, any move apart from a knight move would destroy the possibility of returning to the initial conditions and would amount to a declaration of war.

(    And by the rules of chess, both players are entitled to a copy of all their opponent’s moves during the match. Thus, the two intelligences are able to inspect one another’s binary calculations. This has some interesting implications. ) 

But, now, let's return to the idea of a pawn wall. A straight pawn wall in the middle of the board is not the only possible pawn wall. 

The wall can be set up closer to one side of the board, or diagonally, or irregularly and containing passageways through which other pieces can pass to their opponent’s side of the board.

Straight pawn walls are the only impenetrable walls. Certain irregularities in a wall, as well as positions during the construction of a wall, allow for the passage of some, and sometimes all of the other pieces through the barrier. Some walls only allow knights across, some allow all pieces except rooks, and some allow all pieces across. **Ex. 8.**

In games that feature pawn walls that only knights can cross, it's even possible for second order meta-games to be invented, that is to say, new games that take place entirely within a single, standard game of Chess. 

For example, a meta-game could be invented where points are awarded depending on where exactly a knight lands in his opponent’s half of the board as well as the position of its opponent's pieces around it. **Ex. 9.**

Point based games like this can go on indefinitely within a single standard game of chess. The opponents can even stop playing momentarily to talk using Morse code, to say “Well played”, for example, before resuming the meta-game.                                                

A dangerous possibility is born in games involving a porous pawn well, namely, “friendly fire”, or “friendly checkmate”. 

You see, once the two intelligences are accustomed to living in peace with their pawn borders drawn, they might start using the language they’ve created together to talk privately to themselves instead of to their opponent, just as us humans have developed the ability of speaking privately to ourselves. 

During this time they won't be paying attention to any of their opponent’s moves, and our two extravagantly intelligent spies might both get separately lost in thought, and the expression of the thoughts of one player might involve her moving her pieces such that her king is trapped. 

And the thoughts of her opponent might be such that he moves his knight next to the pawn wall accidentally giving checkmate and ending the spies’ one and only ever game of chess. Tragedy!

Fortunately, accidental checkmates are easily avoided using conventions, such as keeping the king in an un-mate-able position. 

However, with a straight line pawn wall there exist no possible checks or checkmates; as long as the wall remains intact, both sides are totally invulnerable to each other’s moves. **Ex. 10.**

 And now our discussion has led us to quite natural and spontaneous, if very reduced, chess based definitions of such intangibles as Trust and Love. 

Our two prisoners, after a long time using their singular game of chess to communicate with and entertain one another, are likely to develop affection and friendship for one another, and to decide to ""tear down that wall!""

However, and quite dramatically, tearing down the wall requires the ritual sacrifice of four pawns from each side. 

Four of the pawns from each side all capture an opposing pawn.  Then the remaining eight pawns can begin making their way to their opposite side of the board to be reincarnated as more powerful pieces.

This process of pawn reincarnation is another situation where peaceful sides have to be careful to avoid accidental checkmates given the influx of a selection of eight new minor and/or major pieces. 

One can only hope that the eight brave pawns that gave their lives for the good of the many, are reborn on some great Chessboard in the sky.  **Ex. 11.**

But now all the surviving pieces are free to roam all over the board, possibly as part of a thought, or a conversation, or a calculation, or a performance, however their prisoner overlords desire.            

One can imagine in such a situation, that any time one player accidentally, or unavoidably, gave a check to their opponent’s king, they would apologise and try to avoid any further checks or forcing lines, and of course any mating lines. **Ex. 12.**

We can then say that two opponents trust one another if they feel comfortable entering positions that offer their opponent mate or a forcing mating line. 

For example, the two players might decide to use their pieces to perform some mathematical calculation, and they might move into a position such that the moves of some of their pieces can be used as an abacus, or a calculator, or a Turing machine. 

The particular mechanism their Chess calculator employs could involve one of their kings being in a position that offers their opponent a mating line or mate in one. 

If the player is willing to enter into such positions for the sake of mathematics or art, we can then say that they trust their opponent. Thus we can see how collective creative endeavors like mathematics and art require and create trust.  **Ex. 13.** 

One can imagine a malevolent intelligence befriending their opponent and taking advantage of their interest in mathematics to set up a mating trap concealed in a mathematical calculation. A great plot for a very nerdy movie! **Ex. 14.**

Other creative pursuits could involve Trust, such as creating a particularly beautiful or meaningful arrangement of the pieces that involves one of the kings moving into a position that offers their opponent mate.

So, Trust, as defined within the Chess-Universe, is the willingness to move into positions that open you up to captures and mate, confident that your partner will never choose to instantiate such possibilities.       

But we all know that trust can be broken. We can imagine our two prisoners getting into some heated partisan political debate, and one of the players suddenly capturing a piece or pursuing a checkmate out of anger. 

But if our prisoners are intelligent enough to run computer code by hand on a chessboard, it's unlikely they're dumb enough to get angry when they discuss politics!

Unconditional Love would be allowing your opponent to capture your pieces and to begin mating you without any resistance or retaliation. 

This is how Jesus would play; If you captured one of Jesus’ knights, he would offer you his other one “en prise”. At least, so He said! **Ex. 15.**

True love would be a mutual sense of total assurance that, no matter how much you might disagree, neither side would ever do anything that would irrevocably harm the other, that your bond, your shared communication, your games and your art, all that you had invented across the board together, was sacred.

With the discovery of Love ( or maybe as a prerequisite to its genesis ) one king might declare, “Thou shalt not capture another piece”. 

But he’d have no need to declare “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife”, because the rules of chess are naturally monogamous;  since a king can't move himself into check, he can't move onto any of the squares touching his neighbour’s wife. 

And if she tries to get too close to him, he has to immediately move away, or call another piece to move in between them. Just like our real kings and presidents here on Earth, “awkward emoji”!

yqz4o,Herman Hesse...recommendations to help me see the fuss?,"I read half of Steppenwolf 6 years ago and loved, lost the book, got it again and read it through and through and absolutely hated it.

I can't exactly remember what I liked about it, but upon rereading I found the prose relatively lifeless and clumsy, the philosophy a bit juvenile (ok maybe for the time it was edgy, but all its claims seem as self-evident and wince-inducing as Nine Inch Nails' lyrics circa The Fragile). The twist was, well it was fun, not any kind of revelation if you occasionally think about life whilst in the bath.

BUT I don't want this to be a dick on Hesse rant. The Glass Bead Game sounds like a more cohesive idea? Any out-of-left-field recommendations? I keep on being recommended Siddhartha (albeit by people with large holes through their ears, trying not to be judgy but as a white person this is worse than dreadlocks.)

HESSE RECOMMENDATIONS, I REQUIRE THEM. I feel way too comfortable having absolute contempt for him, I'd like to like him (maybe not Siddhartha, holes in ears, 'total revelation man', ick.)

thjt71,Has technological advance somewhat nullified the point of War and Peace?,"Spoilers for *War and Peace* and... history I guess.

*War and Peace* has a lot going on, and as someone who hasn't studied literature extensively I can't grasp all of it. But a huge theme of the book, the theme that Tolstoy explicitly comes back to again and again, is that it's not generals, landowners, or ""Great Men"" that alter the course of history, but the collective mass of the people, the will of whom is independent of any one person's control. ""Kings are the slaves of history"" as he puts it. 

And the interesting thing to me is not just how he argues this in various essays throughout the book, but also how he demonstrates this through the utilization of both real history and the characters he has written. Many of the battles in the book run completely in spite of whatever plans any military leader comes up with. Hell, this answers the big question of the war of 1812, that being ""How does Napoleon, a supposed military genius, get most of his army killed in one of the most blunderous ways imaginable?"" In one scene in particular, >!Kutuzov (if I remember correctly) is repeatedly approached by a messenger who updates him on the status of the fight, to which Kutuzov responds by providing new instructions, which the messenger quickly takes back to the field. The problem observed here is that the battle is changing so rapidly that by the time the messenger returns to the battle, the situation has changed to the point where Kutuzov's instructions are worthless, leaving the messenger no choice but to run back to Kutuzov to update him again, then back to the battle too late again, then back to Kutuzov, etc. It's even suggested that Kutuzov's function isn't to control the battle, but rather to provide the comforting illusion that the battle is under control.!< All of this is intended to illustrate the nearly anarchistic way in which history unfolds.

However... well, while reading this book, I also picked a game called *Defcon.* It's essentially a Cold War themed real time strategy game, which of course means nuclear warheads are one of the main tools given to the player. As a side note, I was pretty engaged for just about every round I played and I recommend it. At first, I had myself recognize that me having complete control over what my forces were doing, and an almost real time feed of what was going on around the globe, was an affordance that most real-time strategies gave the player, and that, as *War and Peace* demonstrated, battles don't play out so precise in real life. But then I had a chilling thought: If the technology in this game is even close to accurate, how much had things changed since Tolstoy's time?

*War and Peace* was written in the 19th century. This was before the speed of information literally shot past the speed of sound. Before all someone had to do to win a fight was push a button and watch the drone hit the building. The messenger can physically no longer be late. Instead of thousands of men chaotically charging on the field, there is instead just one bomb. I don't know if I would call the people behind these things ""Great,"" and I certainly don't find this idea comforting; but on the surface it certainly makes it feel like the influence of a single person has expanded greatly.

Now, this doesn't apply to the entirety of *War and Peace* for the record. Outside of, well, war, other historical forces such as culture and economics haven't become *quite* as roped in. While technology has certainly changed our relationship with these things, I don't think someone can simply say the word and change the belief system or economic state of an entire country through a smartphone. There are certainly people who *claim* to be Great enough to control these things; but so did Napoleon, and it turned out he didn't have as much control as he thought. Besides all of that, *War and Peace* has many other apparent themes, arguably more than I can currently imagine given my single reading of it in the middle of last year. It is still a very relevant and very good book in spite of technological advances. With that said, I also think it's worth comparing Tolstoy's world to ours.

So... has *War and Peace* been partially invalidated by technology?

In my personal opinion: No. I know I just spent a while kinda arguing in favor of ""Yes"" but I was focusing on only one important facet of Tolstoy's argument, that being how much control a general has over a given battle. And yes, currently it feels like we're closer and closer to a situation where someone can win a war by just pressing a button. But there's another facet that I think Tolstoy touches on, which is how the people *respond* to war. 

Very often in the book, characters discuss their thoughts on Napoleon and what he's all about. >!Andrey in specific goes from greatly respecting this massive historical figure to viewing him as simply an ""angry little man."" But the pivotal period for this theme is Volume III. Throughout this section, Napoleon's army pretty much rampages through Russia with the singular goal of reaching Moscow. He gets there, and... it's nearly empty. Instead of the parade he expects a conqueror to have earned, he gets silence. The people have fled. Now it is not simply Andrey. No one in Moscow views Napoleon as any kind of military genius. They're afraid of his army. They hate his guts. To even confirm his powerlessness, the city starts to burn despite his commands to put the fires out. And then of course he flees, plagued by the Russian winter and an enemy that is no longer playing by the rules of warfare, returns home humiliated, and is removed from his position.!< This is important because while maybe one person can arguably disrupt a whole army, the very foundation of the technology they use and the leadership they have comes not from them but from millions of others. And there is nothing stopping those people from throwing out the rules and chasing you out of the country.

This is getting too long and I'm tired. Any thoughts? Am I oversimplifying or overthinking *War and Peace*? Are there any other angles of the book that can be compared to the modern day?",https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/thjt71/has_technological_advance_somewhat_nullified_the/,2022-03-19T00:55:21Z,10,6,literature,The Hating Game,POST
hck2j,"A dark short story, exploring the dangers of the pursuit of celebrity.","Simon was an exceedingly brilliant boy. He excelled in every field he applied himself in with ease and grace; never once gloating in any of his victories. His mild manner, charming wit and wisdom beyond his age belied such a young, slight frame of an adolescent 16 year-old. His affable personality was in no doubt to his parents who were zealous in their affections towards their son. Showering him with praise, despite going through their own turmoil, they provided a loving home to which Simon could return to and develop into what into the charismatic young man he is.  He had memories upon memories of family tales, good and bad, that he could and did at the appropriate moments in conversation regale his friends with the story of when “Mother and I spent a weekend playing board games because the power went out. We played Monopoly over and over again, until I had learnt that the only way I could beat her was to, well actually I never did manage to beat her, She always let me be the dog, but I insisted he also wear the hat. It makes him more distinguished, I would tell her. She would laugh and continue to dominate the games we played. It was as though she knew every move I’d make, despite the randomness of my dice rolls” He would charm his lunch companions at school with gentle humour and a laugh that would settle the calmest nerves. They were etched in his mind, and he was able to recall them at a moment’s whim. He was the center of attention in the school playground, and he basked in his popularity, running successfully for School President, schmoozing his way to Head Prefect and starring in several school productions, of which his portrayal of the Bard’s Danish prince Hamlet was his crowning glory. The teachers loved him. His classmates loved him. His classmate’s parents loved him. His parents loved him. His life was destined for greatness; the series of events that follow are his unfortunate demise at the hands of stardom.

Simon’s memory was a vault, one that he could access with utmost clarity. His recollections were vivid and clear; he could almost transport himself back to every location, to every memory and relive it.  He enjoyed this, his childhood was filled with some memorable moments that he could revisit at any time he was feeling depressed. He was about to need this skill more than ever before.

It was the eve of his 18th birthday. His body now matched the intellect, charm and charisma of a young adult. He stood a favourable 6ft 2in and towered over his mother, who was a petite 5ft 6in. His father was a slender man, gangly arms, with a deep concentration fixed on his face and a tight, furrowed brow as he looked with intrigue at the world around him. 

There was an overwhelming tension in the air, which Simon mistook for the surprise behind his birthday celebrations. (Every year, his parents surprised him with a present on the eve of this birthday, before taking him on an excursion the next day) But the apprehension shown by his parents when he arrived in the front room was incongruous with their loving family.

“Sit down Simon” His father, ordered him sternly.

Simon did as he was told, walked over to the family dining table and positioned himself opposite his mother and father. On the far side of the large oak table, was a vase with a arrangement of Snapdragon  and White Heather . His mother always had an odd taste in flower arranging but she persisted with her strange combinations.  

“Son, we’ve something to tell you.” His father remarked austerely. Withdrawing his hand from the embrace of his wife’s and placing them in a prayer like grasp as he maintained eye contact with his son. 

“Peter.” His mother interrupted before he could continue, “Let me, I … I can explain it better.” She looked at him with wide, open eyes, desperately trying not to blink, so the tears that were building in her eyes wouldn’t fall. 

“Simon, we both love you very much.” She continued.

“We both really do” Peter interrupted.

“Peter, please.” She implored her husband to allow her to continue

“Sorry Kate” Peter retorted apologetically.

Nervously, she continued, undoing a button her blouse as she became hot and flustered as the prospect of the daunting task ahead became apparent. “As you can see Simon, things between me and your father haven’t been the best recently.”

For once, Simon’s memory fails him. No matter how many times he tries to recall that night. Two statements rocked his world that night. Only one he was meant to hear. 

University was a completely different experience than secondary school and college for Simon. He was a changed man. With a warped perspective on life. How could they do it? How could they regard the human life, the human soul, and the human mind as a tool in their ultimate quest? He was a pawn in a grand game of chess where a different player controls each piece. They had no idea that he’d find out. They had no idea that their upbringing would elevate him from the lowly status of pawn to the complex moving knight. 

Simon sat on his squeaky, aged wooden chair, deep in contemplation in his new university dorm room. The walls were a dirty yellow, darker around the aged radiator that was speckled with rust, the curtains were a musty green, aged and bleached from the sun. It smelt slightly of smoke, ‘The previous tenant must’ve been a smoker’ he thought to himself. Then in his first act of rebellion, he decided to begin smoking. He was on the path to become his own man. The same day, he ordered a lotus flower . Three days later, it had arrived and stood pride of place on his desk. 

The sunlight broke through the tiniest crack in Simon’s curtains and met his eye, waking him instantly. The warm strip of light belied the pain that Simon was about to experience for the first time. He opened one bloodshot eye to survey his surroundings, the room looked familiar to him but he could not be sure. What was that thumping? He thought to himself before propping himself up in the edge of his bed. He was naked. This wasn’t right. He was hung-over.

His mind wandered back to childhood. He was ill with the chickenpox at age 7, he hated the smell of chamomile lotion, yet his mother forced him to apply it liberally throughout the day.

pdcb0k,Thoughts: Me Before You (Jojo Moyes),"Would rate it a 6/10, below are my thoughts: 

**Insensitive, mocking and insulting**

For a book on a disabled person, they sure trashed the disabled/weak and perpetuated certain stereotypes. When Louisa first heard that there is a job for a caretaker, she kept emphasising her disgust at having to ‘wipe old people’s bottom’ (and she brought this up FIVE times) and the dedication in showing contempt towards a very respectable job of being a caretaker was simply childish. Mind you, the job listing didn’t even mention taking care of old people, she just assumed anyone needing a carer is old and senile which is even worse.

Subsequently, they even made a jab towards people who talk through computers, as seen from the dialogue where they were talking about Will: 

*Treena made a face. ‘I think it would freak me out, if he talked through one of those voice boxes. Can you imagine? Get-me-a-drink-of-water’, she mimicked.*

And there was one part where they were complaining about annoying tourists and mocked them for going to cafes and saying, as I quote ‘You don’t do sushi’s? Not even hand rolls?’ I imagine no tourist in real life is that stupid and this is an awful attempt at humour.

Anyways I guess at the core of the book, it paints a very very bleak picture of someone living with disability, so much so that they have no choice but to commit suicide and the message it sends doesn’t sit well with me. To be fair they did try to inject some positivity here and there, but the general tone was that life really really sucks for them. Granted that does align with reality, and I guess what I’m trying to say is that the concept of the book in itself raised a few alarm bells and made me uncomfortable. I feel like assisted suicide is a very interesting topic to explore and heavily nuanced, and tackled right can inspire thoughtful discussions. Tackled wrong, it just seemed a bit insensitive to capitalise on such a heavy topic and spin it into a strangely almost casual romance story. 

**Lack of coherent personality/direction for characters**

The characters are all over the place and I don’t even know how the book would like me to view them. Camilla Traynor had the sensitivity to accede to her son’s request for suicide, and was one of the only few people who understood that suicide was not the black and white matter that people seemed to think it is. She’s someone with a strong moral compass, loved her son fiercely and all in all you would assume the book wants us to view her as an admirable person. And yet for the majority of the time, she’s painted as someone who dislikes Louisa but tolerated her out of necessity, and took on a mild antagonistic role for the most part. I honestly think it makes no sense for them to create a conflict between the two characters, as they literally have the same goals and love the same person, and it would have been more productive for the book to explore deeper into a mother’s dilemma and love with regards to letting go of her son, instead of simply depicting her as being a rigid and tensed person. 

Then there’s Steven Traynor, who was narrated as someone who was distanced from his family and an absentee father, but yet throughout the book he was the voice of reason that allowed good decisions to be made. The book narrates his personality as someone scummy, and yet every action he took had resulted in a net benefit. 

Take for example, when Louisa proposed to take Will on a trip, Camilla wanted his sister/her to go with him, and he said the following: 

*’Will needs to be allowed to feel like a man. That is not going to be possible if his mother - or his sister, for that matter - is always on hand’*

Which was probably the most reasonable thing anyone said in the book. 

Many times, the book would simultaneously show the love his family had for him, and in the next breath criticise them as uninvolved. Take for example a paragraph I liked from the book, which was the only time they really touched on a mother’s love: 

*’I looked at Will (…) I saw the vulnerabilities, the love, the history. That’s what he was asking me to extinguish - the small child as well as the man - all the love, all the history’*

This picture of love was promptly erased during a conversation Louisa had with her sister: 

*’I think the the family thinks I’m free loading’ 
‘What, because you want to take him on a few crummy days out? Jesus. They should be grateful someone’s making the effort. It’s not like they are’.*

I guess in short, the characters simply played the role that is most convenient at the time. For example, Steven played the asshole when the book wants to inject some drama, and played the reasonable and understanding father when the plot needed Louisa to succeed with convincing them of her plans. Camilla played the inflexible Mother when we needed some conflict for Louisa, but played the heartbroken Mom when the story needed to pull some heartstrings. It’s all so disjointed, and character traits seemed awkwardly forced together. 

**Dislikable main character**

Louisa is whiny, looking down on all types of job options even though she has almost zero qualifications. She is mean and jealous of her sister, and is bitter of her success. She was rude to the staff at the horse racing track and screamed at her when the staff did not let her in to a restaurant meant for only premier members even though she was literally just doing her job.

But the thing I hated the most was how unfair she was towards Patrick and she was basically just an emotionally cheating asshole. She thought that going on an extended holiday with Will and doing all kinds of ‘honeymoon-ish’ activities was a perfectly reasonable ask, and in fact didn’t even bother telling Patrick about it until he found out by himself. And when he disagreed, she ended her SEVEN year relationship just like that. She was constantly paying way more attention to Will, and anyone in Patrick’s shoes would have felt icky about it but for some reason he was painted as the bad guy in the story. Also she hardly even cared about the breakup which felt pretty shitty 

**Questionable writing**

Alicia was described as ‘Long-legged and blonde-haired, with pale caramel skin, she was the kind of woman who makes me wonder if humans really are all the same species. She looked like a human racehorse’. Human racehorse?

The writing is also really inconsistent. There was a scene where Camilla asked Louisa to serve the guest tea, and literally in the next line the story forgot that the beverage was tea and switched it to coffee. Minor, but annoying nevertheless:

*’Tea would be lovely. Thank you, Miss Clark’
‘Mrs Traynor said you might like some coffee’*


**Irrelevant Content**

There were a lot of boring nothings. It focused so much on Louisa’s family life which made no sense because she’s not the one that’s disabled, why would I care about her family dynamics???? Meanwhile Will’s family was hardly touched on at all WHEN HE’S THE ONE ABOUT TO DIE. They spent so much time talking about her relationship with her sister which adds nothing to the theme of the book (once again, disabled guy wanting to suicide hello?????) like it’s not the least bit essential or relevant to the plot. I really fail to comprehend how a story about a quadriplegic wanting to go ahead with assisted suicide (an interesting theme) ended up talking about his caretaker’s mundane family dynamics 

**It’s preachy**

The story leans wayyyyyyy into the whole ‘you must be productive with your life and do something great with it’ aspect. It kind of puts down people who only watch TV and read books in their free time, people who live in a small town and people who never travelled. There was one part where they passed by a tattoo shop, and Will egged her on to get one and was like what’s the big deal? you can always remove it with laser if you don’t like it in the future (i love how they made it sound so simple) and anyways they framed the whole event as living life for once and not overthinking about everything and okay randomly passing by a tattoo parlour and getting a tattoo on the spot is a very YOLO type of thing and I hate how they are framing it as a ‘finally getting the courage to live life’ like no, you guys are just being mild dumbasses. It’s not romantic, and in reality most people will regret it. 

**The Good**

All things said and done, I did find the scene of them sharing a slow dance at Alicia’s wedding to be sweet and it’s one of the rare moments I liked about the book. And despite everything, I did cry at the ending when she just laid in his chest and they shared a final conversation with each other",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pdcb0k/thoughts_me_before_you_jojo_moyes/,2021-08-28T15:53:27Z,4,27,books,Me Before You,POST

First of all I didn't get the ""aha"" moment in the book that would explain the title.
Second what the-!!!! This has a major twist which you hope doesn't come true but hey, IT DOES. 
It was a great book and I loved it until...you know... You find that out. 
Like 
Am I upset over the book cause the ending wasn't a typical happy ever after???? Or am happy because he did what he wanted to?? It's very entertaining and definitely  keeps your fingers turning the page. I hope the movie is good and I hope they don't mess it up? If anyone else has read it please give me your insight. I fell like I'm the only one who doesn't like the book or is frustrated and happy with it at the same time. 

Also, is it weird that I don't cry during sad movies or books? I can't get the tears out even though I feel the ache of the characters inside.

4mhavt,Me Before You ... problematic?,"(Spoilers below!)

Hey. I'm seeing a ton of stuff about Me Before You in relation to the movie release, which is to be expected, honestly. 


I haven't read it and didn't realize that it focused around the suicide of a quadriplegic man, which honestly seems a little bleak. I don't quite understand why there hasn't been more coverage of pushback from the Disability Rights Community. 

I guess I'd just like to hear opinions from people who have strong opinions either way. People have loved or hated the book?

4mbxvh,Me before you - I didn't like it. Did you?,"The movie is set to drop this Friday in the US....I think. Saw the previews and decided to read the book. Long story short (hah) it pissed me off. The topic was controversial, which I though was quite brave and interesting, but I thought pairing it up with an extremely unlikely love story was in really poor taste. I felt like it could be really offensive to the quadriplegic community (although I haven't researched this) that the whole point of the book was to change Will's mind about assisted suicide. He was a changed man. He was in pain. He had other people constantly making decisions for him. He was sick and he was done. I think Louisa had a very fairytale opinion of him that never would have worked out even if he did decide to change his mind.

4pzovp,Anyone else read Me Before You by Jojo Moyes?,"So as a reader partial to a bit of ""chick-lit"" from time to time (never been a huge fan of the term), I picked this book up after glancing over the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Amazon and after seeing the promos for the recent film adaptation. As with ever new book/author, didn't really know what to expect, went in with an open mind. Just finished reading it and wanted to share my opinions. 

And, well... I dunno. The beginning of the book had about four entire pages just devoted to quotes from readers - the usual stuff about how it's  a life-affirming, emotional, wonderful, tear-jerker of a novel - and while I know it's probably best not to take too much stock from this sort of stuff, I couldn't help but feel like I was onto a good thing. Granted, it takes a *lot* for a book to elicit any kind of emotional reaction from me, but I did inadvertedly had slightly higher hopes going into it than I would normally. It did turn out to be a really enjoyable read - I raced through it in a matter of days, and the final chapters in particular had me gripped in a way that a lot of books don't manage. But it didn't knock me on my arse emotionally or take my breath away like I hoped it would. It told a good story (though at times I did roll my eyes over the more predictable moments and slightly trite prose) but nothing much else seemed to be present apart from that. After the initial afterglow I get every time I finish a book, the general impression just faded away more and more and now I feel vaguely disappointed.

4dztk5,"So I decided to read the sequel to Me Before You, After You....","and I am so disappointed. I knew I should have just kept the ending of Me Before You in my mind. The sequel was such a let down and so differently written. There will be some SPOILERS. 

First of all, Louisa has no spark. She no longer has any of her weird personality that made her so lovable in Me Before You. I understand that she is going through mourning, but man... She just has no life. Even when she starts to perk up near the end of the book, her personality sucks. I loved Lou in the first book and her quirky ways. That's all gone now. 

Second of all... Lou's love interest in this book, Sam, is not interesting. Will was moody, mean even. You saw the transformation that Lou made in him. He went from being very cynical to laughing and buying her bumblebee tights. His heart softened to her charm. Sam on the other hand is not anything special. The chemistry is forced. He is a hot paramedic, who lost his sister to cancer. That's pretty much all I remember him for. He does some kind deeds, but Louisa falls in love with him out of nowhere and the thing that she mentions more about him then anything is that he is good at sex. He does a good thing for Will's daughter which is cool, but other than that, nada. 

Oh yeah, Will has a daughter. That part is actually one of the few pros in the story. Lily is Will's daughter he never knew about, conceived in his douchey days. She is a hot mess. She smokes, drinks, does drugs, has a past that haunts her... Yet she helps bring Camilla, Will's mother, out of depression. Lily is actually like Camilla in a lot of ways, including the love for gardening. Lily is the only one I ever felt concern for, or got a chuckle out of me. 

The whole story though, is lame and clichéd. I feel like Moyes wrote this story with a Hollywood movie deal in mind. There was a whole section where Lily was trying to get away from a guy who had a naughty picture of her, only to have one her step-dad's associates ""rescue"" her and got the photo who then used the photo to try to sleep with her, which prompted Lily to talk to Lou about it, and Lou told Sam, then Sam and his work partner Donna threatened to kill the dude with a made up drug in order to get the photo back from the perv. 

Another thing is that Lou goes to grief meetings with other people who have experienced loss. This could be good right? No. The interactions between the people are so fake, the humor so forced, and I am left uninterested in any of them. She goes to these multi-page meeting quite a bit too! I just skimmed over them after a while and I am certain I didn't miss much. 

The ""tear jerking moment"" was supposed to be at the end of the book, when Lily makes a grand speech about how she loves her dad and she is happy she got her eyes and hair color from him. Reading this, I could actually see the cameras panning and zooming, with sentimental music in the background. It was cheesy. Again, it was very forced. I didn't even choke up. 

I am so disappointed. I am refusing to believe this lame book is canon to Me Before You. I was a wreck after reading the first book! I cried like I had just lost a friend, because you just become so attached to all the characters. They are wonderful, well written friends. After You is a cash grab. Like I've said already, it is just forced. It is cliché. I'm gonna mentally forget about the sequel as much as possible and just keep the awesome first book in my memory instead.

8ucqfw,Halfway through reading To Kill a Mockingbird for the first time; this quote made me tear up,"“I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.""

I don’t know why it hit me. I’ve seen that kind of motivational shit spread around all the time, but just the simple way such a harsh truth was worded so succinctly and the way it related to that point of the story really made me think. I struggle with a relatively mild bit of depression, and a lot of the time I struggle to even leave my bed because what’s the point? It feels like anything I try to do is just gonna fail anyway. I think reading that quote was just what I needed at this exact time.

I dont understand the backlash though. I haven't watched the movie (I will though) but if it's true to the book, Will is the only one that thinks his own life isnt worth living as disabled person.

I can't really talk much about it without giving away important plot points but there are so many characters that do nasty things to each other. The first time this made me angry I caught myself and sort of laughed it off that I'm getting angry about something that is not real. It's not like the stuff on the news channel. It's just a story.

Sure, I had gotten angry before when reading fiction but like surface anger, nothing deep. That's normal. Part of reading is about feeling things. But with Wuthering Heights, I felt pissed. Like really mad. Several times I wanted to stop reading it, throw it out into the fireplace. I kept repeating to myself it's just a story. Eventually I had to take breaks multiple times, sometimes days, before I was able to go back to it. And now it's nearly over. Phew.

Have you had similar experiences with other books? Or with Wuthering Heights?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17ex8xn/have_you_read_fictions_that_made_you_physically/,2023-10-23T22:35:24Z,927,1257,books,Me Before You,POST

2dlrw2,Has anyone read Me Before You (2012) by Jojo Moyes? Care to discuss? [Major spoilers]," I remember picking up the book after reading rave reviews on Goodreads (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15507958-me-before-you), about how the book reduced the reader into a puddle of tears. After see such high ratings on Goodreads (4.32), I thought I'll give it a try. 

When I first started reading it, I was unimpressed. The language was colloquial and reads like chick-lit. Moreover, I was unimpressed by the abundance of romantic comedy tropes (the handsome aloof man lead, the girl who needs to be rescue, the melodrama that brings them together). My reading experience in the first half was basically: come on it has to be better than this...it got 4.3 on Goodreads...Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being only got 4.0 for godsakes. 

I'm not going to say that the writing style changed dramatically or that there were great plot twists. Even just after finishing this novel moments earlier, I still feel that the plot was quite linear and the writing style can be described as pedestrian next to literary greats. However, what I say is that the book was actually endearing and yes, it did leave me in a puddle tears. At the end of the book, I felt like I was Louisa (the protagonist) faced to accept or reject a difficult choice. 

This novel can also compared to the much lauded The Fault In Our Stars (2012), which I also read earlier this year. The subject matter was very similar, but I would say that TFIOS was a bit more inventive in its use of dialogue and character quirks. Me Before You reads like a Sophia Kinsella novel and in a way did not live up to its hype. I don't think it warrants 4.3/5 on Goodreads. 

EDIT: thanks for all the replies. I think I made peace with the book (if there is such a thing). I am going to be Louisa and think of all the good bits and not the cliches. I'd also like to make a book recommendation. I recently read A Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl, a holocaust survivor and psychologist. He talks about the suffering in the camps and how he was able to find meaning in suffering. Really philosophical piece that gets you thinking about end of life issues and the meaning of life. I would say an apt follow-up to Me Before You. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2dlrw2/has_anyone_read_me_before_you_2012_by_jojo_moyes/,2014-08-15T03:38:37Z,6,6,books,Me Before You,POST

18y9zvp,My mom got me The Fountainhead for Christmas…,"Title. Opened this up on Christmas, I think she could tell I was a little confused despite my best acting job but I said thank you and all that. At the end of the day I’m just happy she pays attention to my interests and stuff. But I mainly just found it funny and sorta confusing because she seemed to know a lot about the book… except for the biggest part of its reputation and the people who think it’s great.

Neither of us share any political inclinations anywhere close to what Rand has come to represent, and furthermore my mom’s not the type to read something from a contrarian point of view. I think she legitimately had no idea it’s a libertarian Bible of sorts, and she hasn’t read it. We do live in a largely conservative area though so I’m thinking maybe one of her friends recommended based off her son liking it or something without mentioning the political interpretations.

Anyway, not much a point to this post, just a funny anecdote I thought this sub might be able to relate to. You guys ever get any well-intentioned books gifted/recommended to you that just completely missed the mark taste wise?

Edit: for the wHy DoN’t YoU rEaD iT crowd, I plan on reading it before forming my own opinion. It’s simply an odd choice given the author’s reputation and who gave it to me. Sorry if I insulted one of your fundamental novels with this.

But after my English teacher encouraged me to read because of my apparent gift in writing, I though I'd give it a shot over the Summer. 

Wow. I'll put it simply and say books are awesome. I've never read any books other then what was assigned in school but over the last 7 weeks I've read the Hunger Games trilogy, the complete Harry Potter series, 4 of Murakami's books, (he is currently my favourite author out of the few I know) 1984, and Animal Farm. I've enjoyed them all really, but I have to say Kafka on the Shore by Murakami Haruki was my favourite.

Anyway, back on topic. I'm 16 and have literally read nothing. Can you suggest some books to cap off my Summer of reading? I would really appreciate it. From what I know, I like pretty much everything, and am ready to tackle anything as long as its a good read!

ko1vsu,Oh my god ‘and then there were none’ by Agatha Christie had me throwing the book across the room 🤯🤯,"Just finished ‘and then there were none’. That has to be the most ingenious and best mystery book I’ve ever read. I have been sitting here for half an hour trying to compute what I just read. I cannot express in words how bloody amazing it was. You all must read it! Christie really is the queen of mystery. 
🤯🤯🤯🤯😭😭😭😭

For those of you who aren’t aware, it is a mystery story where 10 strangers are invited to an island, on which they become stranded, and they start getting picked off one by one. 
I also thought it was so incredibly chilling, more so than most of her other books too. The way she wove the web of mystery, skullduggery and suspense was masterful. The nursery rhyme also added a sense of impending doom to myself as the reader. Really clever utilisation of dramatic irony. And the ending was just a punch to the balls! 
I am not surprised in the slightest that this is the highest selling mystery book of all time!

Edit: thank you all so much for the other recommendations. Once I’ve finished all the other books on my list - I’ve got 40 - I’ll get round to all these. They all sound amazing!

Edit 2: I’m so glad I convinced so many of you to pick the book up. I hope you all enjoy it and be sure to return to this post and leave your thoughts when you’re finished! However, I recommend starting on ‘The Murder of Roger Ackoryd’, if you haven’t read any Agatha Christie before - it’s a better introduction to her work. Then read ‘And Then There Were None’.

Edit 3: some people thought i included a spoiler when it wasn’t so to shut them up i’ve removed it. and also, to the trolls: shush.

Edit 4 (god I’m doing a lot of these 😅): thanks to those of you recommended the BBC/Charles Dance adaptation. It was good. I wish they had made it more true to the book, but it was still enjoyable viewing. Charles Dance was excellent. After you’ve finished the book, you ought to watch it. Felt that it wasn’t as chilling as the book, but that might just be because I know the ending lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ko1vsu/oh_my_god_and_then_there_were_none_by_agatha/,2021-01-01T00:52:55Z,1117,10281,books,Me Before You,POST
z1a32i,Just finished Fahrenheit 451 and I think I've found me a new favorite author,"Ray Bradbury has such a unique and interesting way of describing the world in 'Fahrenheit 451', one that is very refreshing to read. I love how poetic the writing is and how the story is broken up partly into the main characters thoughts. For example, the author will repeat some lines of narrative to make it sound like the MC is trying to convince himself of something. I've never seen that done before and it was cool to read. Though at the same time I can imagine why it would be tedious, so anyone who has read it, maybe you could share your opinion? Did you find it annoying?

I haven't read this book before. I believe we are reading it either this year or the next year during school, and can I just say I am so thankful I read it before I was forced to. I really enjoy dystopian, especially when the author describes in depth how it affects individuals and culture, and Ray Bradbury did this perfectly in Fahrenheit 451. In fact, one of my favorite parts that he does this is on pages 96-97 when they're talking about politics (I don't want to spoil anything, so if your interested you can look at it.) 

All in all, this is now one of my favorite books. I am also a writer, and I think Ray Bradbury's style of writing is one that I will look up to from now on. I love the imagery, descriptions, and the way his sentences flow together. Very Inspiring. 

So if you have read the book, please feel free to comment about your opinion on it. Be it plot, writing, the meaning behind the dystopian, or anything else. I just thought it would be interesting to hear some other thoughts about the book from others who have read it :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/z1a32i/just_finished_fahrenheit_451_and_i_think_ive/,2022-11-21T21:00:05Z,170,688,books,Me Before You,POST
38wuqr,So my date took me to a bookstore yesterday...,"I hope this isn't off topic for this subreddit but I wanted to share a book related adventure I went on yesterday afternoon. This guy I really like asked me out for coffee and then took me to Barnes & Noble. Before we went in he gave me instructions:

""You need to pick out the best book you've never read.""

So we went in and after some very careful deliberation I picked out *When the Killing's Done* by T. C. Boyle and he ended up with *The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers* by Richard McGregor. Once we revealed our selections he looked me in the eye and said ""Now switch!""

So now I have to read about China's Communist leaders and he has to read T. C. Boyle. I wanted to share this because I thought it was a clever idea for a first date between book lovers and an unusual way of getting to know someone based on their taste in books. 

Has anyone else done something like this? If so, how did it turn out?

18880wt,Nitpick: The Alchemist's Portrayal of Egypt ruined it for me,"For context, I'm Egyptian.

The story itself is... Alright... But the way Egypt and the Sahara are represented just doesn't make sense to me. I guess to the western audience it's supposed to be exotic and stuff, but to me, it is not only mundane, but most of it is also untrue.

Faiyum is not a random Oasis in the middle of the desert where a bunch of Tribes live in tents, it is one of the country's oldest urban centers, and served as its capital for a while, under Persian rule.

That basically ruins the middle part of the story for me because I just find myself cringing at a hyper exotic version of a real place i live very close to.

a part of the story revolves around a point where the main character can not leave Faiyum because the desert is dangerous at that time, problem is, Faiyum is not in the desert. You can walk straight to the nile without going through any desert. 

I know this is stupid but the portrayal is so off it just hurts to read. I can't relate to or imagine a story that is set in a wrong version of where I live.

/endrant

edit: 

I wanted to add that the casual orientalism was kind of annoying as well, the book seems to be set in the mid to late 1800s/early 1900s but insists on portraying everyone south of Gibraltar as a tribal medieval freeman.

In real life Egypt was fighting the Ottoman empire in a major modern war at this time and nationalism was on the rise, something that isn't common among medieval societies.

But noooo Egyptians are weird tribe people who wear weird Arab clothes, live in tents, and believe in weird desert omens.

Oh, and dont forget, all muslims randomly say ""maktub"" while acting vague and mysterious and looking at the horizon over the desert.


edit 2: 

I have received some harassment regarding my ethnic background in my DMs. I am, to be honest, truly disappointed in this sub, I did not expect that my simple critique of a book would turn into me getting attacked for my race.

Thanks guys.


edit 3: i have labelled a [satellite image](https://i.imgur.com/xXeQSoT.png) of Faiyum so people can stop pestering me with the ""it's a small oasis in the middle of the desert"" shit, it's dozens of miles across, shut up already.


edit 4: the harassment is getting worse, I am getting called ""arab trash"" and ""imperialist colonizer"" and told shit like ""your country will never get better when people like you are it's citizens""


I'm probably not posting here again. I experience racism on reddit all the time, but this is on another level. I haven't had my DMs spammed with racism before.


edit 5: It keeps getting worse and worse.

I've been called awful things, for both my religion and race.

Illiterate, barbaric, rapist, thief, colonizer, imperialist, invader, force converter (and force converted by the way, racists aren't particularly intelligent), I've been told that because I am a muslim the only thing i have done is rape and steal, that muslims have not invented anything, that any good thing attributed to a muslim was stolen from a christian eastern roman, that i'm disgusting, that i have no claim to my home country, that Egypt should be colonized since the people who live there are ""arab colonizers who believe in might makes right"" i've been told I live in shit, Everything.

I have lost a big chunk of my faith in humanity, or whatever was left of it.

edit 6 and probably last: I just wanted to share an example of the shit I got sent:

""Inshallah, by the nature of not being an Arab Muslim, I am already a better person than you.""

His 17th novel, 'Shades of Grey2: Red Side Story', will be published in the UK in 2022.

Fforde's writing is an eclectic mix of genres, which might be described as a joyful blend of Comedy-SF-thriller-Crime-Satire. He freely admits that he fascinated not just by books themselves, but by the way we read and what we read, and his reinvigoration of tired genres have won him many enthusiastic supporters across the world.

Amongst Fforde's output are police procedurals featuring nursery rhyme characters, a series for Young Adults about Magic and Dragons set in a shabby world of failing magical powers,'Shades of Grey' (2011) a post-apocalyptic dystopia where social hierarchy is based on the colours you can see, 'Early Riser' (2018), a thriller set in a world in which humans have always hibernated, and 'The Constant Rabbit' (2020), an allegory about racism and xenophobia in the UK.

Fforde was born in England but has recently decided to adopt the nationality of where he lives when he heard that: 'When you truly love Wales, you are Welsh'.

92rgsi,I just want to thank you guys for getting me into reading.,"I'm 15 and I hated reading so much. 

It seemed so boring to me and I was constantly getting distracted. I'd read a whole page but wouldn't understand anything I've read, and thought I hated reading. It turns out that I never hated it, I just wasn't reading the right books. 

Some time last week, I saw a post on the front page from this subreddit talking about the book, ""When Breath Becomes Air"", and how it was the first story that made someone cry in 15 years. I didn't believe you could actually be touched by books; the stories I was forced to read in school never made me feel that way and I assumed all books were the same.

Before I even clicked on the post, I checked it out at the library to see what it was all about, and I finished it in two days. I was bawling my eyes out by the end of the book and since then I've been hooked.

I found out I loved reading on my own, at my own pace, peacefully in my room. Sitting in an overcrowded classroom full of kids who didn't want to be there, reading 20 pages a day, and having to stop in the middle of a chapter just to answer questions about the character is the reason why kids think they hate reading. And it doesn't help at all that teachers pick the slowest readers to read the longest paragraphs in the book. 

I looked up must-read books on Google and this subreddit came up, giving me a whole list of books that people recommended. I went to the library on Sunday and picked up 4 more books that were on the list. Today I finished reading The Alchemist, and tomorrow I will read Brave New World.

I looked at the date and length and thought it would be boring, and I even made sure to download a few other books before I started reading it on the assumption that I would need a break during the tedious parts.

There?? Were?? No?? Tedious parts???? I stayed up until 4 in the morning to read the first half and only fell asleep when my eyes could not process any more words. I don't know how Dumas manages to write 1200 pages of nonstop action and intrigure & I am in awe! Les Mis is around the same length, and as much as I loved it, there were definitely parts where Hugo went off on long tangents and my eyes sort of glazed over.

Obviously there were some parts of the book that have aged poorly, but on the whole it was an incredible journey and I'm so glad I finally picked it up.

**ETA: Woah, I was not expecting this to get so much attention. I've seen a lot of commenters saying this convinced them to pick up the book, so yay! I hope you have fun reading! And naturally some people disagree with me and didn't like it, and that's cool too :)**

I almost quit reading A Fatal Grace because of how a teenage girl was described as “grotesque,” Myrna is always described as “huge,” and any time a female character is introduced some comment is made about her weight.  It’s so unnecessary and doesn’t add anything to the story.  I don’t need to know that Gamache’s wife is “not plump but not trim either.”

‘The table looks wonderful,’ said Myrna, peeling off her coat and revealing a bright purple kaftan. Clara wondered how she squeezed through doorways. Myrna then dragged in her contribution to the evening, a flower arrangement. ‘Where would you like it, child?’ Clara gawked. Like Myrna herself, her bouquets were huge, effusive and unexpected.

Myrna led it, having grounded herself with a full lunch of casseroles and bread. Very important, she explained to Clara, to feel grounded before a ritual. Looking at her plate Clara thought there wasn’t much chance she’d fly away. Clara examined the twenty or so faces gathered in a cluster on the village green, many of them apprehensive.

The reason I'm here is that I'd like to accomplish the 52 books in 52 weeks challenge this upcoming year.  I've tried before but am always getting sidetracked-- I think my previous high was 37.  But this year is going to be different!  This will be the year that I'll do it.  I was wondering, however, if anyone would like to join me.  I think if there is a group of us attempting it, we have a better chance of accomplishing the goal.

I'm thinking we could have a weekly discussion to talk about the book read during the week.  That way it gives us something to look forward to when we finish each book and can voice our personal opinions and get insight from other people on things we may have missed or overlooked.

If you're interested, there is a few things we should address as soon as possible:

1.  A subreddit devoted to our goal and have our weekly discussions.  I have looked into other subreddits with the same goal, and I found two.  One that is private and another that seems to be for users trying to accomplish the goal on their own (rather than in a group like we'd be doing).  There is /r/bookclub but that is a monthly ordeal.  I don't think /r/books would want us having weekly discussions here about it--I'm not sure, it is something for the mods to decide.  If not, /r/52in52 isn't taken and I think we could use that.

2.  We only have about a week before we get started and need suggestions for the 52 books for 2016.  Feel free to comment in this thread, or once we figure out the subreddit we choose to host this challenge at, we can have a megathread about it.  We would have to choose the 52 books (I'm thinking via polling) within the next few days.  When thinking of which book you'd like to request, I would suggest you keep it under 400 pages a book.  Asking some people to read over 50 pages a day might be getting to be too much with all we go on in our lives.

3.  Buying books can be expensive.  This is why getting a library card to your local library is crucial!  If you'd like to participate in this challenge then get a library card as soon as possible so you aren't as likely to spend a lot of money on books.  
*ProbablyobviousbutI'mgonnasayitanyway tip:  Don't get all 52 books at once.  Get one or two at a time and visit your local library every week or two to exchange books.

If there's anything else you think I may have missed or if you have any other questions, please let me know in the comments.  

Thanks guys, happy reading!

**EDIT:** Reading all of your suggestions, thanks for the input! I'm thinking that I will also include a ""what did you read this week instead"" discussion thread for those who chose not to read the selected book of the week. This would give people more freedom in choosing what they want to read and still encourage them of a solid pace of a book per week. More people could participate this way and still be very active in the community.

This would likely be done via the ""create a new subreddit"" route.

But I'm still open to suggestions so please keep them coming!

**2ND EDIT:** Hey guys, user /u/lucasgorski99 went ahead and made the /r/52in52 subreddit so we are going to do the challenge over there!  So go ahead and subscribe there if you're interested.  I'm still taking opinions on how to do all this so please keep commenting on this thread!

Also, when it comes to deciding books, I think we all should have a say and vote for what we all should read!

What do you guys think, 12 topics for 12 months or just a different book every week?  Would you rather have just one 'set' book a month like top comment says or would you be more driven with one a week?  Remember, you don't have to finish the book in one week like some of us, you can ignore the book thread until you find time to finish the book!

**3RD EDIT:** Just for clarification, I'm not trying to step on any other subreddit's toes here. If you're interested in doing the 52 in 52 but wanna do it independently, I totally suggest /r/52book.  If you wanna have more of a book club but only about 12 books a year, head on over /r/bookclub.  Both of them are wonderful subreddits for those niches. My original idea was to get a bunch of people to read the same 52 books (or as many alike as possible) and have weekly discussions on them. I'm still taking suggestions though so keep them coming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3y8vno/for_2016_i_am_going_to_try_and_read_52_books_in/,2015-12-26T03:09:22Z,669,4870,books,Me Before You,POST
19c1c71,"Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow - mistake drives me crazy! Did you notice?","So in the book, there‘s this line: „‚Zweisamkeit’ is the feeling of being alone even when you’re with other people.‘ Simon turned to look in his husband’s eyes. ‚Before I met you, I felt this constantly. I felt it with my family, my friends, and every boyfriend I ever had. I felt it so often that I thought this was the nature of living. To be alive was to accept that you were fundamentally alone.“ Except - that is not what Zweisamkeit actually means! Zweisamkeit describes the state, where two people are alone together without being disturbed by others. So, it‘s actually a positive word! It drives me nuts that they didn‘t notice when editing the book. Like, why did nobody check a foreign word‘s meaning just once?
Did anyone notice that, too?

EDIT: UPDATE: People were saying that in the book it says that the definition is wrong because Simon is not a native speaker. I seem to have an older version of the book because that line definitely does not exist in mine. So, I have concluded that they noticed at some point that the definition of „Zweisamkeit“ was wrong and added the line about Simon‘s definition being laughable in some later edition, meaning that the mistake was not intentional. I read the book like a year ago, so that is probably why my book still has the mistake on its own in it, and newer versions have the line about Simon not being a native speaker added.
Another detail that adds to this is, that Zevin repeated the wrong definition in an essay 1,5 years ago, saying: „It means the feeling of being alone when you are with people — this is me“. It‘s on PowellsBooks.Blog.
Of course that is a minor error. Mistakes can happen, so of course it‘s not a big deal! It was just driving me crazy because I couldn‘t believe I was really the only one that noticed and I began to question my sanity lol!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/19c1c71/tomorrow_tomorrow_tomorrow_mistake_drives_me/,2024-01-21T11:20:25Z,132,428,books,Me Before You,POST
16vi9in,Never Let Me Go…….um…not sure how to feel,"Soooo I just finished Never Let Me Go and I’m really not sure how to feel. I mean, I guess it’s a good story over all, but I really don’t think I liked it. I mean for one I actually did not like or care for any of the characters aside from poor Tommy. Ruth especially was just so toxic. 

Secondly, the sci-fi element is a complete after thought, which I get is intentional but still. Not what I expected. 

Lastly, I just lost my focus. It was always “let me tell you about a time this happened, but before that, I must go back even more when this thing happened to the thing. Let me explain the thing and its importance to the other thing etc…..”. 

I see what the book was supposed to be about,  but I felt like it just didn’t go anywhere. I’d say if you were expecting a mysterious sci-fi mixed with a dramatic story, look elsewhere. I feel like I was just sold on a false summary of the book. Anyone else just not get into this one?

ETA: I’m was not looking for an exciting adventurous action packed sci-fi with a happy ending. As I stated in a comment below, I was expecting something like a Black Mirror type story, San Junipero, being an example.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16vi9in/never_let_me_goumnot_sure_how_to_feel/,2023-09-29T17:48:06Z,208,266,books,Me Before You,POST
171fspd,Jane Eyre is being groomed or this book is an early work of kink- convince me otherwise,"Forgive the deliberately provoking title, I was feeling dramatic.

I’m determined to finish Jane Eyre because I want to read “Wide Sargasso Sea” but jeez, Edward Rochester is the most unpalatable pos. Obviously this book was written in the 1800s, ~~well before the suffragette movement~~ but other writers of the time (Charlotte’s own sister even) were examining domestic abuse in their work so it’s interesting that Jane Eyre might show the most subtle examination of the machinations of controlling abusers.

After Rochester proposes, he tells Jane that the best part of marrying her is that she has no relations. He also wants to send Adele off to boarding school when they marry. Isolate from people who care about her? Check.

He tries to dress her like a doll, bedeck her in jewels and silks. She rebels and instead of recognizing her as a person, he delights in making her anxious. Controlling her appearance? Check.

Mrs. Fairfax says Jane is Mr. Rochester’s “little pet” and tries to warn her off him. This annoys Jane and puts distance between them.

Mr. Rochester is always calling Jane weirdly possessive and diminutive pet names while the writer hints at his lust in the moment-  “my good little girl” etc. At some point, Mrs. Fairfax points out that he’s more like a father to her than an equal which makes Jane balk.

I can’t help but feel, especially because Jane is really chaffing against these aspects of Rochester’s courtship, that Charlotte was trying to explore how abuse looks early on, how to tell when something is going to be toxic before it goes to far. She also is very frank about the things that make Jane vulnerable to Rochester: her loveless childhood, her lack of family support, the reliance of women on men to provide for them financially…

But then, the ending. Why put them together in the end after all this exposition that the man is, tbh, awful? Am I putting too much of my modern sensibilities into reading this?

Thoughts?

EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up to the degree that this did. Obviously people have strong opinions about Jane Eyre

I wanted to make a correction to my original post because u/I-hear-the-coast rightly pointed out that the suffragette movement, in the US, began in the 1840s and as u/Vio_ reminded me, Mary Wollstonecraft published ""A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"" in the 1790s.

I also wanted to address the number of comments calling me variations on ""ignorant"", or ""uneducated"" because I asked if Charlotte Bronte intended to imply that Jane was being ""groomed"". While, yes, words like ""feminist"" didn't enter the zeitgeist until the 1890s, and ""kink"" was not a subculture in the way we think of it today (even if there were fetishist practices in the 1800s that we would think of as ""kinky"" in today's terms), I find it bizarre to argue that women like the Bronte's weren't thinking/talking about their rights, their limited agency, and even sex, when it's a major theme in their books? Sure, it's possible Charlotte didn't have the vocabulary to talk about grooming, but she sure as heck knows how to depict Jane's discomfort in how Rochester is treating her post-engagement.

Anyway, my point is, if I misrepresented history in my post, it's in that I wasn't generous enough to women of the 1800s. They understood their own oppression more than I gave them credit for originally.  I'm sorry if I hit a nerve because you're a Rochester or Bronte fan. I'm not coming to take your fave book from you. I really appreciate everyone‘s thoughtful responses here, and want to thank anyone who drew attention to my own mistakes.

EDIT 2: rereading my edit from last night and it definitely comes off spicy and condescending- especially the last part. Sorry to anyone I offended by that, it wasn’t the intent. I’ve really loved reading the dialog on this thread and am genuinely grateful to everyone for engaging with this subject.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/171fspd/jane_eyre_is_being_groomed_or_this_book_is_an/,2023-10-06T15:48:13Z,413,1440,books,Me Before You,POST
1yp0wm,"Me Before You by Jojo Moyes reduced me to a sobbing ball of mush and I would read it again. [spoilers possible, proceed with caution].","I usually don't read romance. I try to avoid romance books because they are utterly unbelievable. Luckily, this book is so much more than a straightforward love story.
I picked up this book based upon a lot of glowing recommendations. Moyes writing style is very approachable and she brings out the humanity in her characters with such effortless ease. I found myself laughing at some of the dialogue and interactions in the book because they are so realistic and something you would encounter in every day life. I adore Will and Lou's relationship because there is so much friction that promotes growth. The parts in the book that made me cry were when Will's mom and Treena are discussing their sons and how they feel about them given the situations they're dealing with as well as the pivotal moments in Will and Lou's relationship. I also found that the discussion and viewpoints about euthanasia to be heartbreaking and Moyes' handling of people's reactions to the topic (Josie, Patrick, etc.) to be varied and seemingly realistic. In a situation where ""people wouldn't understand unless they had to make that decision"", I felt Moyes did an excellent job of presenting viewpoints that help the reader understand the weight of decisions loved ones are posed with handling. I felt the message at the end was hopeful although it's coated with pain. Then again, how is their love without a little bit of pain? There may have been points in the book where the suspension of disbelief is necessary although in the end, I would highly recommend the book.

l0lope,I didn't think Lolita would mess me up so bad.,"Sorry if gushy posts about how a book made me cry aren't allowed, but Jesus Christ man. 

I knew what Lolita was before I read it. I knew it was about a sick, evil man ""falling in love"" with a little girl and taking advantage of her after her mother dies. But I think going into the book with this knowledge actually made it MORE difficult to come to terms with. 

I hated Humbert. He's evil, he's deranged, and I wanted to feel happy when he died. But I couldn't. When he killed Clare Quilty and drove recklessly, covered in his blood, so detached from anything, I cried. I hate Humbert, and the book was so wonderfully written that I actually empathized with him, and I was lowkey disgusted with myself for it. I know he's the epitome of an unreliable narrator and that he spends the duration of his confession lying to himself and the reader, but I actually caught myself feeling sorry for him. He's a deranged man, destroyed by an obsession that drove him to destroy the lives of others. 

But then I realized... I was falling for Humbert's trap. That is what Humbert WANTED me to feel. He made me feel his suffering, his fear, his pain so deeply that I nearly forgot about Dolores, the real victim of the story. He destroyed her. He completely destroyed her and I was almost too blinded by Humbert's misery to see it, and yet it's plain as day. When he was killing Clare, I caught myself feeling like Humbert was a man, hopelessly in love, destroyed by that love, and he had that love torn from him and was left with nothing. Humbert wanted the reader to feel that way. 

Humbert didn't love Dolores. He loved the idea of her. He was so obsessed with his sick idea of ""nymphets"" that he completely forgot that they were just kids. He was so obsessed with Dolores, put her on such a high pedestal that he completely forgot that she was a person, a HUMAN BEING who he utterly destroyed. And I was so blinded by the tale of a man losing himself in insanity, to the point where I was crying because I FELT SORRY for this miserable sack of shit, that I too forgot for a moment that Dolores was a person, a child, and she was the one who was actually the victim in all of this. That probably sounds insane to anyone who hasn't read the book and that's because it is. Dolores lost her mother, her friends, her innocence, her WHOLE LIFE and it was old poor Humbert that I caught myself crying for.

pxxy4a,Anyone else with Amazon Kindle lost rights to digital content? I lost nearly half thousand dollars of content a while back only to find out a no fault glitch would not let me open my books. Today I get an image for very expensive scholar text that’s again just over 5 years old - Amazon’s TOS.,"The short story is Dear Amazon Kindle users be wary.  Your electronic rights are only five years and after that you have no right of access to THEIR books.

The long story and a rabbit hole of frustration for you fine peeps will be an image in the comments I received when I tried to open my books several months ago.  I don’t mess with my devices and so such messages just seem bizarre.  I’m not sure what I did back then but I’m sure I did a lot of personal trouble shooting including removing devices and reinstalling.  When I exhausted myself I contacted Amazon Customer service both online chat then in person.  This was a long process of jumping through hoops and basically rolling out all possibilities (including what I did) and saying it was my fault for deleting the books.  I can guarantee I never did before seeing the image in the comments.  The image that prevents access to the books.  An image I see again which I have touched NOTHING with any of my devices nor added any new devices.  Nothing has changed except time itself.

Now I got the message for a very expensive scholar book and I have no reason to believe contacting them will come with any different result than last time.  That is unless some of you people have some insight you can give me.  

Also, it would be great if you have insight to prevent these messages.  I sincerely have no idea why they are coming up.

fzon2b,Just finished 'The House of Leaves' and the last 200 pages had me on the verge of an anxiety attack,"*major spoilers below*

So as a whole, I loved the book. I wish there was a little bit more of a concrete answer about the ending, but that's just my opinion. I know there are forums on the internet of people deciphering every minute detail, so to each their own. 

That being said, the last 200ish pages is some of the best writing I've ever read. It's strange because it's not like anything really happened, but that's what made it so anxiety provoking. Following Will's descent into the house, into nothingness, was so unsettling. And the way it's written really makes you feel as if you're feeling exactly what Will is feeling. You're flipping through these pages faster and faster, feeling like you're just on the brink of finding out about some tangible monster hidden in the house, only to find out it's just more nothingness. Then the part where he is sitting alone, reading the House of Leaves but has to burn the page he just read to read the next is beautifully haunting to me. This sense of acceptance of what is to follow after that last page has been burnt is melancholic but peaceful. Also, I loved how one of the footnotes was a claim by another author that the blue light he sees right before the film stops was Karen's flashlight. Not sure why, I just loved this detail. Really loved how Johnny's descent into madness at the end really mirrored what Navidson was going through - despair to acceptance. Amazing ending. 


That being said, what are some of your theories? I know this is a common one, but im of the theory that Pelafina wrote the House of Leaves as a way to cope with the fact that Johnny died soon after birth. The story at the end, Johnny says his friend from Seattle told him a story about a newborn child and her mother at the hospital. I believe that Pelafina really was institutionalized but it was because of the grief over Johnny dying as a newborn. Once in there, she created a whole imaginary life for her dead son. Also though, I don't know how Zampano ties in with her or if he even does at all. I have read a theory that Zampano is Johnny's father.

16xpuot,The Twilight Saga unironically gave me hope for my future as a deeply closeted queer kid,"If it's going to bother you that I'm going to express a semi-ironic but also deeply earnest fondness for the Spoorkle Vempir book, trigger warning I guess. Everyone knows it's self-indulgent trash, 'ight? We've had like, 15 years of that. Everyone knows Mormons exist. Everyone knows everything teenage girls and stay at home mothers like is the fifth horseman of the apocalypse. We can move past that.

*I'm an ftm transgender man, I came out as a (at the time) lesbian when I was 16, and started transitioning just two years ago. I read the books when I was around eleven or twelve, living in a very oppressive environment both in the local culture and at home.*

Little kid me was hard-core *obsessed* with these books. Something adult me has been left thinking very introspectively about since . . . I kind of strongly dislike romance. I think I've finally figured out why. 

I must now jumpscare you with the revelation I was a bit of a loser loner growing up--- I know, what a surprise, hope you had your smelling salts at hand. So cards on the table, I literally completely and utterly missed the extremely obvious subtext that there was supposed to be a love triangle *at all* in the series until the movies started coming out and I got the chance to talk to other Twilight fans. Read all four books, literally never occurred to me once Jacob was anything other than another obstacle for Edward and Bella. That's because, as an adult, I can see now that I was reading something entirely different out of subtext of these books. That these novels are designed as indulgent fantasy scenarios where anyone can project themselves into them is lobbed at them like an insult, like that's an inherently bad thing, but screw that unironically these novels were the first and closest things I had as a child to there being even a fraction of a chance I could be happy and okay one day as a queer person. 

I realize this was entirely likely not at all Meyer's intention for these books to be read this way, but that doesn't really matter.

 ""Bella I'm a horrible terrible disgusting creature of the night, I'll make you a social pariah if you love me, I'm a forever alone."" 

""No Edward you're beautiful I love you and I love all of you and will be absurdly devoted to loving you even if it makes me a creature of the night to do so."" 

It me. I'm Edward. Or rather, I related to Edward feeling like by loving someone he was going to destroy them even though my man did just love Bella, for very just genuine reasons in the text of the novels. I was a few years away from discovering Ann Rice, alright? I was a child who had from a very young age been smacked over the head repeatedly that the type of affection that was natural to me was vile and disgusting and less i express it I'm putting both myself and the girl I have a crush on in danger. One of the shitty parts of growing up queer is that long before you're actually willing to admit it to yourself, other children notice. Even without the words to verbalize it, when I was seven years old there was a girl in my class that, all I knew was that she was the coolest, prettiest, most perfect person I had ever known and all I wanted was to very innocently be around her all the time and have her tell me what a good ""friend"" I was and maybe even possibly get to hold her hand if it wasn't too much to ask. I got bullied literally for fucking years over just that. Out of a kindness in her beyond her years she never did anything to me to explicitly estrange herself from me, despite her other friends giving her shit for it. I never got to be close to her, and I don't blame her for that. 

That Bella is so fucking absurdly willing to make her relationship with Edward work despite his vampireness making everything extremely complicated was earth shattering. That she thinks his vampirism is actually pretty cool despite what society says was literally life changing. You can say whatever about the relationship being toxic blah blah blah, yes reading the books now as an adult there's tons of elements that bother me too, but again, it's okay to give the material some slack for that reason alone.

I think sometimes when people insist certain pieces of media give little girls ""bad messages,"" they're willfully or unconsciously not actually considering how that age and demographic interpretes a text. Like, ""Disney princess falls for first male she sees, Ariel give up voice for man, Belle stockholmed, Snow white kissed by man she don't know."" *Are valid things to point out and consider* but often are given way, WAY too much weight compared to how a child is viewing that piece of media. Tween girls don't have the life experience or political framework to draw that from the text by themselves, it takes additional pieces of indoctrination that are more explicit for them to actually internalize that. Pare-bonding, fated mates, soul mates, twin flames, overly possessive relationships with poor boundaries or proper foundational work or any other kind of romantic attraction without any ambiguity is something I find deeply disturbing to be confronted with in media now. I'm now old enough to know just how much that cultural mindset set me up to get deeply hurt by the time I was an adult. Disney movies, teen romance, Twilight and the whole genre of supernatural fiction it spawned didn't teach me that though. Society did. My parents did. At worst none of those pieces of media challenged that concept, and at best, that media met me where I was at. 

The thing about Twilight that genuinely is subversive though is that it categorically, vehemently insists every ""drawback"" of engaging romantically with vampires is stupid and wrong. Twilight says Vampire rights, love is love. Vampirism is a valid choice that doesn't actually exclude you living a normal happy life, even though they've been forced to act in certain problematic ways ways as a group marginalized by society. A group of vampire facists have literally taken advantage of this to their own benifit to victimize their own kind for personal gain *cough* republicanswhogetcaughtwithgayescorts *cough*. They literally *sparkle in the sun* and human propaganda has turned that into them *burning because they are against God and nature oh why does that sound oddly farmiliar.* Again, I realize Twilight likely wasn't intended to be any kind of queer allegory, but vampires kind of accidentally end up almost seeming like one even if that wasn't the intent because of the cultural mythos built around them. In that context, there are elements to Twilight that are more progressive than Ann Rice's vampires as queer allegories.

tgz0tu,"I'm reading a japanese crime novel, and the small cultural differences from an European perspective tend to kick me out of the story.","I'm currently reading  *Journey Under the Midnight Sun* (白夜行 ) a japanese crime novel by Keigo Higashino. It's not my first novel by Higashino, but this one felt different enough that I felt the urge to post to see if others have the same reaction.

I'm not sure it's a bad thing, but the small cultural dissonances sometimes kill the immersion in a way that I have seldom experienced before. It makes the whole thing ""Other"".

First thing is probably due to a big translation challenge (I'm reading in French).

The story takes place in Osaka, which is famous in Japan for its local dialect *Osaka-ben*.

It's not just an accent, it has variations in verb forms, vocabulary etc that are very recognizable for a Japanese speaker, even in written form. But French has no such equivalent, so the translator resorted to things like :

>*""How are you ?"" he said using the Osaka dialect.*  
>  
>*""I'm fine, thanks"" she responded in standard japanese.*

It's a bit clunky. Now, I don't have a better solution to propose, but it reinforces the notion that you are an external observer, that need things translated and explained. Interestingly, the translater chose to use French emergency numbers when people have to call the Police (17 in France, 110 in Japan).

I once saw an anime that dealt with the issue by making the Osaka-ben speakers use Canadian French in the subtitles, but it worked because it was comedy (and the osaka-ben speakers were blood cells from a transfusion).  I'm curious if an US English translation would try something like peppering Osaka speech with ""Y'all"" or another well known regional marker.

The other thing are the small but clear cultural differences, it's generally true in other japanese crime novels, but in that one it really stuck with me.

The story has a lot of murders, but also several school girls who are victims of sexual assault.

Each time, the victim, friends and families keep it as a secret, because it would be disastrous for the family honor, the girl studies and chance of marriage. They're also relieved that the assault stopped short of rape and the girls are still virgins.

Now, I'm not naive. I know it is quite frequent in real life and victims of sexual assault have to struggle with this . But what's jarring here is the way it's implicitely described **as** ***the obvious and correct thing to do***. Policemen privately praise the family for keeping it a secret.

So again, this creates that ""outsider looking in"" feeling that I don't have when I read a Miss Marple novel, even if I'm not an old lady and never spent a day in a small English village.

The story itself is engaging, even if (barring a last minute twist) it's clear where it's headed. Higashino is very good at fleshing out his characters.

hfhv7q,Having an E-reader changed the game for me.,"Before I received this e-reader for my birthday I occasionally would read a book (like 4 books a year or so). 

However, since I received the e-reader I have been reading all the time. Waiting for the train to arrive? No worries, just whip out this small, compact, and light device which I'm using to read a 1000 page book on! Same for riding the train, taking a dump etc.

I think, for me, it's the accessibility that makes it so nice to have since I can have multiple books on the device instead of only being able to bring one book at a time.

uh1nuo,I've finally started reading Lord of the Rings. Why did no one tell me this was a fairytale?,"Alright so I know a lot of you may be rolling your eyes at what I'm about to say because it's ""wow so obvious"", etc. However, in my (non-English speaking) country, people don't generally read Lord of the Rings. Everyone watched the movies, of course, but only the folks really interested in fantasy literature read it; and personally, I don't really fit that category. I don't have anything against Robert E. Howard or anything like that, but it's just not the genre of book I've grown up with. So please be gentle if I end up repeating something that everyone but me apparently knows.

Also, please note that I've only read 10% of the trilogy (about a quarter of the first book), but I've read some of his interviews and his essay On Fairy-Stories, so I feel reasonably confident on thinking what I think.

Anyway, in 2020 I was temporalily suspended from work and confined, and so I had a lot of free time. I intended to read Lord of the Rings, and I did start but the prologue kept me from going on - it was just too many names and I had my own preconceptions of the story. After telling a friend of mine that LotR was a bit too complicated for my mental state at the time, she convinced me to read Dune instead.

Please stop laughing. (It was great btw)

I got through my mental state through grit, having to make sense of all the words and actually enjoying the complexity. I then took a break reading some Discworld and a lot of comics, and eventually tackled War and Peace. Russian names are the bane of my existence, but I powered through it.

Feeling quite uppity about myself, I started just this weekend on Lord of the Rings, expecting a very dry story recounting a complex tale full of the serious names of serious men who did serious things. I did love the movies, but I felt like I wouldn't enjoy them as much if they were stretched over a thousand pages.

Imagine how surprised I was to then find out that it was a *fairytale*. An honest to God fairytale, with ""and there he found great delight""s and ""O Gandalf! Please tell me!""s and other phrases like that.

The aesthetics of the story feel taken directly from a Howard Pyle illustration or one of Andrew Lang's Fairy Books; and I *bloody love* fairytales, especially well-written ones.

See, I was vaguely aware that there was a rift between Swords and Sorcery fiction and Tolkien fiction, but I didn't expect it to be *this* deep. Frodo behaves like one of King Arthur's pages, the descriptions - both of the history of the world as of the page-to-page character interactions - feel like modern adaptations of late 19th century literature. It's not only a fairytale, it's clearly written by someone who *loves* fairytales.

Like, take the Elves for instance. Contemporary fantasy tells me I know elves, they're the civilization of pointy eared guys that live on the forest and are generally detached.

*Tolkien* elves, on the other hand, feel like fairies. As in, the fair folk. Sídhe. Whatever. They don't feel like ""a civilization of guys"", they feel like ""a people""; a group of fantastic creatures like dragons or giant boars. They feel like the kind of person King Arthur would meet dining in the middle of the forest and playing with a golden ball. Like, they're magical, that's the driving point.

I feel like years of being close to people trying to understand Tolkien in a rational, grounded, real-world way kinda poisoned the way I saw the story. I figured that, if people were arguing about how the economy of the elves worked, or if the Balrog had wings (and the properties of wings for that matter), that the story concerned itself with that sort of question; or at least took it into consideration. What I've found was a fairytale from a world that doesn't exist anymore. It doesn't really *explain* a lot of things, just like fairytales, because they expect the reader to piece stuff together from their understanding of the world.

There's this example that really stuck with me from when I was reading the One Thousand and One Nights as a teen that mentions, in passing, that a Djinn was muslim. That felt weird to me; why would the Djinn practice a religion? Wouldn't they have their own religion? Are there Djinn mosques? Among a ton of other questions cropped up. And then it hit me: the Djinn is muslim because Allah, in the story, is the creator of everything. *Of course* the Djinn is a muslim, and could be a christian too, *why wouldn't* he be?

This is similar to how Beowulf treats Grendel too. Like, Grendel in a more modern story would show up, kill some guys, and Beowulf would predictably get real angry and hunt the monster down, because he's a monster and the like. But that's not how the people who wrote Beowulf saw the world; the mother of Grendel comes afterwards demanding his blood-price, because that's the law. And teen-me would have thought ""wait, why would she follows the law of men?"", but from the poem's point of view, the more apt question would be ""why *wouldn't* she follow the law? The law is of *this land*, not just of men, and everyone contained in this land follows it.""

A great example of this inside the world of Tolkien is during the first night of Frodo's journey, a fox looks at him and thinks ""huh, Hobbits this far? that's unusual"", and moves on with his life.

Personally, I really don't see a lot of this in contemporary stuff, because well... foxes don't think. And grounded stories don't feature thinking foxes, or the mom of the monster persecuting legal resource, or muslim forces of nature, because that's the *logical* step you'd take. That's ""how it'd happen in the real world"", but Tolkien doesn't really seem to care that much about this at all, and I love his work for it.

In short, I expected another Dune, and received a King Arthur story. I'm really enjoying the story, the clear passion that goes in fields and trees and the land itself, even the little songs every so often. I expect it'll only get darker as tragedy strikes and the quest gets closer to its conclusion, but fairytales are like that.

Sidenote, but I really appreciate how seriously Tolkien takes death and how commited he is to pity. As a Christian myself, it feels really refreshing to see something like this:

>‘But this is terrible!’ cried Frodo. ‘Far worse than the worst that I imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I to do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!’

>‘Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.’

>‘I am sorry,’ said Frodo. ‘But I am frightened; and I do not feel any pity for Gollum.’

>‘You have not seen him,’ Gandalf broke in.

>‘No, and I don’t want to,’ said Frodo. ‘I can’t understand you. Do you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy. He deserves death.’

>‘Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many – yours not least. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts.

God bless his work. And God bless Terry Pratchett too, I only got interested in LotR in the first place because of him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/uh1nuo/ive_finally_started_reading_lord_of_the_rings_why/,2022-05-02T22:36:47Z,412,2504,books,Me Before You,POST

The first book in my new graphic novel series Great White Shark Adventure publishes tomorrow, March 5. Ask me anything!","Hi Reddit! I’m Fabien Cousteau. My name may be familiar to you because Jacques Cousteau, the most famed sea explorer of modern times, is my grandfather. I grew up on The Calypso, my grandfather’s ship, and learned to scuba dive at age four (my very first memory of the ocean!). From then on, my future carrying on our family legacy to help educate people and protect the oceans was sealed. I have chosen to dedicate my life to educating the world, and especially kids, about ocean conservation and the environment to help positively impact the world through the Fabien Cousteau Ocean Learning Center. Whether it be releasing baby sea turtles, diving in a shark shaped submarine, or exploring parts of the ocean that have never been explored before, I strive to show the wonders of the deep blue to the world and to help kids want to do the same when they grow up.
 
My illustrated novel, GREAT WHITE SHARK ADVENTURE, releases tomorrow from Margaret K. McElderry Books, an imprint of Simon ＆ Schuster Children’s Publishing!
 
Some cool facts about me: I lived underwater for 31 days straight as part of Mission 31, the longest underwater science expedition ever. I reached over 100,000 students throughout the world, Skyping into classrooms to show them what my life was like while honoring the 50th anniversary of my grandfather’s own experiment living underwater during Conshelf Two. I explore legends of the deep, like the Belize Blue Hole, where I piloted a submarine with Sir Richard Branson to the very bottom of the ocean sinkhole on live television to share the mystery with the world.
 
My grandfather once said, “People protect what they love, they love what they understand, and they understand what they are taught.” The ocean and its vast beauty is what I love and strive to teach others about so that they can love it too.

y98g38,Help me understand Tolkien,"Before you ask: yes this question was prompted by watching the Amazon tvshow.

I was born in the 80s and discovered reading somewhat later than most. I must have been 15 or 16 when I started reading seriously. One of the first book I read was the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien. I was completely mind blown by the experience, and it sparkled a life long journey of reading mostly Fantasy.

To this day, I still have trouble describing LoTR to people that have not read it. I sometime find that people that read it as well have had a different experience than me. I am seeking help in putting words on that experience (and maybe finding similar novel that have so far eluded me).

The first characteristic that I have never found again in fantasy is the style. It is a very classical and elevated style of writing. The immense majority of fantasy is written in a modern, more immediate style. I am not sure what to make of it, really. The thing that strikes me most is that every so often I am told that other saga are ""just as good as LoTR"" and pointed to the Wheel of Time, or the sword of truth series. No offense to fans of these but how do they even compare? They are not even in the same league. Interestingly those are some of the popular ""alternatives"" and are probably the series I dislike the most.

Another thing that I find interesting is what I would call the magical setting. Sauron's power defies understanding but he is mute and invisible. The ring is tremendously powerful but nothing is shown of this power except for the way it corrupts the soul. Magic permeate Tolkien's universe but is almost invisible. This is one of the things that gives LoTR a dream like quality that I never encountered again. I think that the Royal Assassin does a pretty good job at capturing a similar feel, with its poetic way of weaving magic into the world - and is, coincidently, one of my favourite series.

I guess that what would help me is to have a more scholarly take on Tolkien's work, which would help in turn understand what makes LoTR so special for so many of us. Perhaps even steer me to novel or series I have yet to discover?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y98g38/help_me_understand_tolkien/,2022-10-20T20:06:26Z,171,262,books,Me Before You,POST
3ubfuf,"The /Random button has taken me to a lot of places that will change me forever, but this, by far has been the best.","Ever since the 5th grade or so I could remember hearing the dial up tone logging into AOL.  Being only 26, I've had the luxury of having the Internet accessible almost my whole life.  The Internet is great, but I realized that I never really ""read a book"" before.  As hard as that is to believe, about the same time as I was required to read any book of significance was about the same time I found out about pinkmonkey.com, sparknotes, or any other website that gives you just enough information to get a passing grade on a book report, test, or any other assignment that my school required of me.  I became really good at BSing and using the thesaurus to make the summaries I copied and pasted sound like I wrote them and appear that I read the material. 
 

....Then about 2 weeks ago, in my usually boredom induced routine  I clicked on the random button on reddit's banner. It took me here, to r/books.  I then realized that a lot of people actually do read for fun (6million+ subscribers can't all be wrong).   So, not to be the one left out of the party, I figured I would give it a shot.  


I picked up ""The Doors of Perception"" which included ""Through Heaven and Hell"" by Aldous Huxley shortly after deciding I was going to give this whole ""reading thing"" a shot.  To my surprise I finished it in one sitting.  By most people's opinion, probably not the best book to start off on, but for me, it was the right choice.  I couldn't put it down! I have always loved a good documentary, especially when it's exploring controversial subjects, human consciousness, and anything that's informative.  I have always entertained the thought, how cool it would be to see the world in another's eyes, to change your perception of the world.  After reading, I realized I more or less did just that.  No awe inspiring moments, or ""awakening"" came the book, but for those 90something pages I was hearing a different voice.  The voice in my head was using words I have never used before (or seen for that matter), utilizing sentence structure completely foreign to me, ideas and scenes  that even the greatest of documentaries couldn't have painted were all clear while reading.  I have never felt that (sober).  In fact, even now, it's hard to describe exactly how I feel or felt while reading. 


All that time and energy I put into ""cheating"" the assignment could have been spent reading.  As cliché as it sounds, I really felt the only thing I was cheating on in school was myself.  Since then, I have read in order;  ""Food of the Gods"" by Terrence McKenna, ""Fingerprints of the Gods"" and ""Message of the Sphinx"" by Graham Hancock, and now I have about 50 pages left of ""Sex at Dawn"" by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá.  Even just typing it out now, I'm still blown away that I have read this much in two weeks. 

I think it's safe to say the random button on Reddit has taken me to a lot of strange places, but  r/books has been by far the best, possibly the most life changing it has ever brought me to.  


sorry if this is wrong place to post this, but I felt you'd appreciate my new found love.   If anybody has any questions on the books that I have read, I'd be more then happy to try to answer them the best I can.  

***also sorry for grammar/ spelling errors, posting from my phone and I tend to miss a lot.

1b2q2uv,Tess of the D'uberville MAKES ME FEEL,"Reread this book again since high school, and I am surprised at how much more of the emotions resonate. It's such a heartbreaking book because everything just sort of... happened. The mentioning of the coaches at every important turn in her life seems like a foreshadow of this point. That all this tragedy was just going to happen, as a result of centuries of doing.  You can't blame Tess– she was helpless – with her bedroom occupied, the role she had to play, the innocence she had to give up. She had absolutely no choice but to shield her heart, to numb her emotion. Which she did, though unsuccessfully. How often have you been able to control that flatter in your heart?

You can't blame Angel(which btw how ironic is the name)– as a man who has abandoned dogma, it seems difficult for him to comprehend and understand Tess's history. To me, he (and Alec) seemed like a person who resembles the conflict between theology and morality. What informs one's morality of what is good or bad without theology? Mind you this was the time before all ethical theory and theological morality still dominate.

Also, can we take a minute to appreciate Hardy's writing?? That man makes me FEEL!!!  The anguish the hopelessness the love Tess's final letter was. The internal turmoil when Tess was thinking about Angel. The anxious, pacing after she told Angel.  And the ""borrowed happiness"" at the end. The contrast of Lady Day in the beginning with the white flock and ""the private little sun for their soul to soak in"" contrasts with the gray cashmere gown, under the same sun. WhAo!

If you can’t read the summary then and choose whether this book is to your tastes…then don’t read the book or at the very least don’t review it, knowing full well you were;retry sure you wouldn’t like it…

If you do this…why? Why are you setting both yourself and the author up for failure, knowing that you don’t like that topic or genre, and reading it and saying exactly what you knew before you opened the first chapter. 

I just don’t get it. 

I never judge authors for these reviews, but sometimes I will literally look through the reviews history for this just to see if that have any common sense at all.

14vdrvv,I read the First Law Trilogy by Abercrombie and it blew me away,"Spoilers for the general vibe of the endings of the main characters but not any events specifically. Spoilers have a text warning above them.

Wow. I picked up this trilogy on a whim. I had just finished the Three Body Problem and needed something more fast-paced and character driven. 

The First Law Trilogy (The Blade Itself, Before They Are Hanged, and The Last Argument of Kings) was absolutely peak fiction in my eyes. 

Granted, I am the perfect audience for a grimdark, stylistically written, alternating PoV fantasy series. But damn, this series has proved to me that so many authors are falling short of what they could be doing.

Abercrombie somehow makes a trilogy that just gets better with every book and ties off every plot thread neatly in a satisfying way. So many fantasy series just drown in plot holes and incomplete storyline. It really felt like Abercrombie started from the ending and wrote backwards, which is incredibly refreshing. 

On top of that, he constantly subverts expectations, has some wild twists that are completely believable, and deconstruct fantasy to the bone. 

I don't think this series is for everyone, but readers that enjoy dark literature and deconstruction in their fantasy will be blown away. 

There are a few flaws that stood out to me. There aren't many female characters and the female characters don't have that much agency. I'm personally fine with that so it didn't bother me. I could see that bothering other readers, so please do note that. 

I've also heard people say The Blade Itself is too slow. I disagree, but it is the weakest in the series. It's still phenomenal. It has a lot of high points, but compared to other modern fantasy it could be taken as slow.

The only complaint I had with this series is also somehow one of my favorite aspects of the work:

(Spoilers of how the ending is!!! Don't read this part if you want to read the series, and I reccomend it!!)









The ending is defeatist and essentially nihilistic. While ""the good guys win,"" it is subverted and shows that victory isn't what it seems. It feels like not much progress was really made, and the world and our protagonists are completely broken. This is honestly great, and it's done tastefully. It doesn't feel like it's being depressing to have a tragic ending for the sake of being tragic. It feels more realistic than anything, but it still didn't feel great.

On one hand, I was euphoric reading such high quality story telling. On another, I just wanted to see some kind of a happy ending. It was a bit merciless to have literally 5 out of 6 of the main characters have an overtly negative ending. Still, I like that Abercrombie did this.

I hear that he becomes a bit less savage towards his protagonists as the series continues, and I've purchased all of the rest of the series and will be manically devouring them.

The reason for the question is that when I see it on Reddit or other forums, they usually emphasise the word I’d expect to have emphasis.

If any of these trigger you, please don’t read this novel. One more thing I’d like to mention is my thoughts on how tons of readers hated the heavy use of politics, COVID-19, masking, vaxxing, and all that jazz in this novel to the point of being rude and mean to each other due to differences of opinion._x000D_  
_x000D_  
As always, reading is subjective and everyone reads for different reasons. Some like the escapism of novels and want to stay away from anything involving world and political events. Others don’t care at all and welcome it for whatever reason. Some will DNF a novel the moment they see things like that because they completely disagree and get all worked up. Others will enjoy it because they agree with that side of the debate._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Whatever the case may be, do whatever makes you happy as long as it’s not at the expense of treating others badly. It’s important to remember that if readers completely disagree with King’s views on politics, masking, vaxxing, etc., it’s okay to stop reading and move on to something else. Just please don’t start attacking your fellow Constant Readers because they agree with him on these kinds of topics or vice versa. We’re all readers at heart with different genres and topics we enjoy so no need to attack or be rude to each other over political differences or how people ultimately feel about COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc._x000D_  
_x000D_  
In my opinion, King is 76 years old and will be 77 years old on 9/21/24. The fact that he is still writing novels at such a high level is nothing short of incredible. I’m just glad he is because he will forever be my all-time favorite author. Regardless of how you feel about his political views and opinions on COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc., if you are a horror reader at one point or other in your life he probably gave you at least one character or book you enjoyed based on something he wrote. He’s been writing for over 50 years now and is still going strong._x000D_  
_x000D_  
These trigger warnings I mentioned above don’t bother me at all since they’re just words on paper to me. Remember my friends, be kind to each other, no matter where you stand on these political and COVID topics. Whether you agree or disagree, just treat each other with kindness. Trust me, it truly goes a very long way in life._x000D_

Anywho, I loved this novel so much and I would consider it one of the best he's written if you go on this Holly journey. It was that extraordinary to me and just like the other novels featuring Holly, King did a wonderful job weaving a story within a story within a story with tons of little subtle references here and there._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Everything from The Princess Bride, Blood Red Sky (I loved this movie on Netflix), Freddy Krueger, Carrie (lost my mind when he did this), and even The Haunting of Hill House all made me smile. I love it when King does things like this, especially with his legendary work._x000D_  
_x000D_  
The intro to “Holly” was a wild one and my goodness, King dialed up the horror with a very gross twist to things in this one. I made lots of weird faces with those insanely descriptive situations. In general, I was so happy to see Holly get her novel and not only what she’s been up to lately but also how she has evolved in the grand scheme of things._x000D_  
_x000D_  
To finally get more of Holly’s backstory and fill in the gaps to what makes her tick was such a great thing to read. I have connected with Holly way before this novel came out and reading this solidified to me that she’s a rockstar. I just love the kind of person she is, how vulnerable she can be depending on what is going on at the moment, and just how she figures things out over time._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Seeing Holly continuing to be Holly as she pieced things together in this horror mystery novel was a lot of fun. The suspense is throughout this novel and besides Holly, I also enjoyed how King was able to include Jerome and his sister Barbara to also get updates on them which was nice to read. This is a big reason why I highly recommend reading those five novels I mentioned above since it’ll just make it more meaningful._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Besides this incredible unique and disturbing story, King did a phenomenal job breaking down an underlying tone to “Holly” that was evident throughout this novel. Seeing Holly process grief due to what she’s going through was engrossing. Everyone handles grief differently but to see such a complex and riveting character as Holly goes through this on top of trying to figure out what she’s investigating was nothing short of brilliance._x000D_  
_x000D_  
It goes to show that no matter how strong, weird, or complicated someone is on the outside, grief like that affects everyone to some degree even as they vehemently deny it on the inside. Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but I just loved seeing Holly turn into the person she is now. Not only am I impressed but well, proud. I know that’ll sound weird but I went through a five-novel journey reading them all in a single week and feel like I know Holly. Even King said in recent interviews promoting this novel that there is a bit of Holly in him and well, everyone. I also feel the same as I’ve seen some of my tendencies of handling things as Holly would which makes her so relatable to me._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Another thing I loved is how the presence of Bill Hodges so many moons ago impacted Holly so much that it is still helping her in the present. I swear, the quote that King put to open up this novel (“Sometimes the universe throws you a rope.” - Bill Hodges) just hits you from beginning to end. Speaking of which, my goodness, the climax to the ending was fantastic! The main antagonists in this one were pure evil and I loved how Holly handled everything in stride towards that stupendous ending._x000D_  
_x000D_  
I was on the edge of my seat getting through that ending because I didn’t think that would ever happen and to see Holly do what she did make me scream YES!!! so many times in my head because it was so epic. It was quite the buildup and everything ended perfectly. I loved the ending. Mainly because it ended the way it should have when it comes to Holly and the kind of character she has now become. As always with anything I read by King, I was left mesmerized as Holly is now one of my all-time favorite characters he’s ever created._x000D_  
_x000D_  
I give “Holly” by Stephen King a 5/5 as it was so worth reading all the novels Holly was in before this one was published to enjoy watching her evolve into the person she is now. The horror, creepiness, and disturbing aspects of this novel were bloody magnificent. It probably isn’t a good idea to eat or drink anything while reading this one but at the end of it all, Holly rocks. I’m so glad King decided to give this influential character her novel because this has been quite the reading journey I will never forget for the rest of my life. Finally, the last little thing King left me with besides all this awesomeness involving Holly is that I will never look at vanilla ice cream the same again.

16dfdua,I had my mom read to me 'Little Women' cause I couldn't bear it on my own,"I was 23 at the time and it was my first time reading the book. I had just gotten to the saddest part of the book where you just know that in the next chapter Beth is going to die.

I was sobbing so much i couldn't bear reading it, I just didn't want to get to that point in life, that you only pass once for the first time, where you exist in a world that you KNOW Beth is dead.

So.. I asked my mom to read to me the next couple of chapters and I just snuggled up to her and wept uncontrollably 
Needless to say I took a week long break to recover enough to be able to keep on reading 🥲

13yjese,"Review of Stephen King's ""Night Shift"" makes me think I should try his short stories","I know there are a lot of Stephen King fans on this sub. I'm not particularly one of them but maybe that's because I've only tried a few of his overlong novels - that's the idea I get from this review in Slate of his 1970s short-story collection Night Shift, which calls it ""the earliest evidence of King’s greatest gift: his twisted and seemingly inexhaustible imagination.""

""The inherent economy of the (short story) form means that the idea itself is the star of the show. Each story is like a guy who shows up to the campfire, tells the scariest yarn you’ve ever heard in your life, then promptly leaves before anyone can fuck it all up by asking him to elaborate.""

1bjh80a,DISCUSSION: I was disappointed by Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go,"Now, a bit of a disclaimer: I'm really not trying to be inflammatory or hateful on this book, and I think it's worth mentioning that I only picked it up because Remains of The Day is one of my all time favorites and a book I thought to be near flawless, hence, the disappointing feeling I got when reading this other work. **And of course it goes without saying that this is just my opinion.**

**I'll start with what I thought were the positives and what worked for me:**

* The book is incredibly easy to read in a way that doesn't feel dumbed down. It's mainly the skillful use of simple language that just makes this book flow beautifully and naturally.
* The themes explored in the novel are in themselves poignant and interesting, even if I wasn't satisfied with the exploration of those themes itself.
* The world in the novel, even if it ultimately serves as a backdrop to explore the relationship between these characters and isn't meant to be this sci-fi deep world-building thing, was very intriguing and unique.

**That being said, these are the things that ultimately annoyed the hell out of me:**

* I found the three main characters to be quite annoying and whatever the opposite of lifelike is. I don't want to get into spoiler territory but I will only say that I found that most of the fights and discussions that felt important for the plot relied entirely upon contrivances such as the main character stating ""I really wanted to do X and I really really should have done Y but for some unexplained reason I didn't"" (The unexplained reason always seemed, at least to me, to be because the plot needs for things to play out in a particular way). Additionally I never quite ended up liking the three protagonists and found them all to be quite repetitive and two-dimensional in their actions. Take for example:
   * Kathy being forgiving and empathetic to a fault.
   * Kathy getting irked and annoyed at the smallest, most subtle things.
   * Tommy never quite developing an actual personality other than being a bit of a hot-headed doofus with a heart of gold, that, really, just feels like he's there to be a love interest for Kathy and feels like he walked straight out of a generic YA novel.
   * Ruth being just two-dimensionally awful in the most repetitive way possible. (It feels like her thing about fronting being in-the-know and then being petty when challenged repeats ad nauseam)
* I found the pacing to be really weak and repetitive in two distinct ways:
   * The use of flash forward to drop some mysterious hook-y line about what *would end up happening* (For example, the excessive use of the last line of a chapter being something a long the lines of ""And I would have been fine if it was just x... but then y happened"") before jumping back on the timeline until you reach the reveal of that particular section gets exhausting by the second half and once you've noticed this trope has been used over and over and over and over it starts feeling like the artifice is revealed.
   * I found the Hailsham section to be phenomenal but as we move on into the lodges and the care centers, the book becomes completely centered around the main love triangle, which I never really cared for, and I found it starts becoming slow, dull and uninteresting.
* Ultimately I also hated the never-ending delaying of answers about the world in the novel, which, I know isn't the point, but by the time those answers came I had already guessed 99% of the information revealed, and was mentally checked out by then. 

Sorry for the long rant nobody asked for. I suppose that what hit me about this book is that I love Remains of The Day a LOT and I was excited while reading the first half of this book. After the dive I felt the narrative took I was crushed and I'm still left with an unsatisfactory feeling, even if I did leave with a few interesting ideas and thoughts.

That being said, I want to hear what other people think. I'd really appreciate it if anybody would like to address my points and if you thought otherwise and why. I'm open to hearing about your experiences.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1bjh80a/discussion_i_was_disappointed_by_kazuo_ishiguros/,2024-03-20T16:11:15Z,188,265,books,Me Before You,POST
t0m0h1,It Ends with Us is trash. I was swindled by Tiktok. Tell me otherwise. I dare you.,"So last month I finished It Ends with Us by Colleen Hoover, and let me tell you I did NOT expect to dislike it to the extent that I do. I did not also expect to feel scammed by Tiktok over this highly popular book which so many people- to this day- make constant posts about how it's their favorite book.

It wasn't just Tiktok, it was constantly on every platform that could ever recommend a book. It was on reddit, Instagram, Youtube, GoodReads and so much that you actually want to give it chance, cuz you think, ""that many people can't be wrong, can they?"" And hell, they were. I just don't get it.

This is ofc a rant on the whole book and how I felt afterwards, its only my take on it and I know that it could be your fav book I'm trashing, but then again I'm only going to respect your opinion. And in end, if it gets too heated, let's just agree to disagree. So here it goes:

&#x200B;

Rating- 1 star(with extra generosity, and only for Atlas)

&#x200B;

LOVE-

\- Atlas of course, his story and his kind and considerate actions.

&#x200B;

EH?

\- >!condescending main girl, even though writer tries to show she's not (no don't tell me she wasn't, every time she described Atlas in the beginning, she constantly called him ""homeless"". Sometimes even when things are obvious, you just don't verbalize it, words like that can be ugly and as a reader I only felt that this girl was looking down on him. Was it really necessary to call him that that many times? really?)!<

>!\- TELL TELL TELL TELL TELL TELL writing.!<

>!\- characters who spend literally no time bonding (except atlas and lily), and the only ""bonding"" scenes is mating??? Not only with Ryle and Lily, but also Lily and Alyssa. Lily meets Alyssa in the afternoon, and by evening they're BBFs? Totally possible. Yes!<

>!\- Chances that Alyssa is Ryle's sister? Every single one. Yes, totally possible again. (cringing so hard my face might contort)!<

>!\- Ryle? A big fat mistake to walk on the face of the earth. Honestly, no it's actually Lily. Lily's a big fat mistake.!<

>!\- Girl doesn't think twice before marrying some random dude she met 6 months ago, after the possible risk that he might turn out like her father? WTF was she thinking? Oh right, she wasn't. She just doesn't think.!<

>!\- Dude is a huge red flag in itself cuz he doesn't care abt relationships, and all he wants is to bang and leave (Do you guys see a toxic pattern here in CH's books? Does this remind of another book/2 maybe? Let me help you- Ugly Love and stupid Verity(it's the girl here tho)). !<

>!\- How could she like him???  How???! Oh cuz he's good in bed, right. Or ""oh his voice hits me right in my stomach"". Totally. Girls aren't so gullible like CH makes her FMCs out to be , which is such a big hypocrite factor for me cuz if she's writing a book about women empowerment, she truly needed to up her game rather than write things that make girls seem like they're nothing more than superficial aff.                            ???!<

>!\- Oh, here's the fun part tho, he changes. For her. Yes another fucking totally! (I'd rather be run over by cows with shit all over their feet than read this book)!<

>!\- Most of the time it felt like the things that the characters did didn't feel much like what they would actually do, but rather what the writer is making them do. The fact that it feels this way is a clear sign that the writer has derailed from the story.!<

>!\- Lily doesn't want to make a decision on their marriage until the baby comes out because of what!!!??? Pregnancy hormones? So all pregnant women are incapable of making decisions at all then??? And then immediately, the moment the baby comes out she decides for a divorce??? The fucking second she sees him hold their daughter? No preg hormones then huh? Yes, of course. What CH writes is what actually is. Yes.!<

>!\- Terrible writing. Terrible characters. Very distracting plot holes.!<

>!\- What's up with Allysa? She was soooo purposefully made that way, the cliché friend, so common it hurts. She naturally just sees the sign and comes to work for Lily? Cuz she's too bored of being rich? Where does this even happen?!<

>!\- Lily hires Allysa without a second thought. No background asked, no serial killer check, no nothing. ""Just gonna work for free??? Okay cool. You can start right away. Oh l kinda feel guilty for making you work for free though, so $10/hour? Sure. Of course.""!<

>!\- WHAT THE FUCK WERE THOSE JOURNALSSS??? EWWWW. Could she have come up with anything worse than those to convey the story? Guess we'll never know. After reading the book, I fully realize the sole purpose of the journals was so that Ryle would find them, and do what he will so that the story can progress. Terrible. While I was reading, it would've made so much more of an impact if the writer chose to maybe give Lily flashbacks of her time, dreams every single day, like she was always constantly traumatized by what happened to atlas. She then visits maybe a therapist to take help from, and he says journaling might help, and then ryle find those papers. Or ryle just goes through her files from the doc. Can't make him more of a dick than he already is, so why not?!<

>!\- People don't just get over that trauma of being in an abusive household like how CH made it look like- it haunts them for the rest of their life. When someone places something a little to hard on the ground, when someone shouts, when someone's quiet, when someone's being a little too rough with them even when they're clearly joking, they're constantly reminded, they constantly wonder if that someone is angry. Where was this??? WHERE??? Terrible writing.!<

>!\- Lily was a pain. So very frustrating. She blamed atlas for not coming back for her, while she dated the first guy she met. The guy who clearly had a temper. No, I'm not saying she should've known before, but I'm saying the obvious reaction should've been doubting men because of her childhood, I've known people who are extremely cautious of the same because of going through something similar. I know not everyone is the same, but that reaction should be blatant. How could she even find him attractive? How is she not reminded of her father all the fucking time??? How does she not take caution before dating another man??? !<

>!\- She met him on a rooftop, he flirts, and she falls in love with him?   ?   ?   ?   ? It makes more sense if they just hooked up than get married because of that, because that's all he wanted anyway.!<

>!\- Repeated disappointing behavior. When he did what he did the second time, it should've been over there. I don't care how much she loved him, or how much of their future she saw(which the author didn't mention one bit of, 0% explanation of show writing and 10000% of just telling-""oh she loved him, so if you disapprove, you're standing on the outside, you don't understand"". NO. Just NO.)she should have walked away without another word. But no. Even when he says he blacks out because of what he did to his brother, she only should've felt sorry for him and nothing more, but she takes that as a valid justification on his behalf for what he did. This is why girls like Inej and stories like Six of Crows are legendary-""He's gonna fix himself, and I'm gonna fix myself"". Not one person doing the fixing for both of them. Fuck this!!<

>!\- I never expected a character to be perfect. I in fact like stories that display the contrary, like if I were reading about a morally gray character, I'd like him to find redemption at some point, if I were reading about a character who never made mistakes, maybe he'd make a grave one along the way in the book, something to say that things can always go against us and we'd make poor choices. I get that. But what I truly don't get in IEWU is the ""repetitiveness"" of the same bad choices, up to the point where it gets so frustrating to sit with. He (literally) bites her neck of, punches her, pushes her down an entire flight of stairs, and each time she forgives him. She's covered in bruises all the time, but he says he loves her though, so she forgives him again. What does that say to the women going through the same kind of thing? That's it's okay to be let yourself be treated that way? For what? !<

>!Plus the entire dislike of this book doesn't only revolve only the abusive part, it's also the unrealistic writing, the relationship of the FMC with others. The time jumps, as well as how she never apologized to the right people. Had a Atlas and Lily's position be changed, and atlas the reason lily gets beaten by his father, do you think readers would be okay to see atlas go on w never once apologizing? why double standards people?!<

>!\- Randomly just meets Altas one day, and decided to finally be together out of nowhere? Where's the angst? Where are the proper confrontations? Where is the fucking apology for what her father did to him??? WHEREEE??? TERRRIBBLLEEEE!!!!<

>!\- Pacing? No Jumping. SUCKSSS. Terrible writing.!<

>!\- I get that the book tried to be more on the educative side rather than entertaining, so its totally fine with the themes that play around. I'm never gonna say something was too difficult read (except ofc unrealistic trauma like A Little Life, but that's a story for another day) But where  is the realism when trying to convey that? Where is the strong, brave female lead who walks away at the right time? Where is the female lead who inspires other girls with her story, where she makes an example of herself and NOT someone who people can relate to, cuz sometimes what we need is someone who we can look up to and NOT someone who's on the same level and feel sorry for them because we fully understand what they're feeling. She's not his babysitter. She's not here to make him behave his best. ""He's going to pull himself together, and she's going stay by his side while he does that, not literally do it for him, and forgive him time and time again when he can't because then he's going blame her for not doing her job of pulling him together. Where's the female lead who never once looks back after something so cursed takes place, never even thinks that there's a possibility that more chances could be given? Because some things once said and done, there's NO going back. NEVER. Where is she? WHEREEE? Terrible.!<

\- Lacking in every way.

\- 0 aestheticism.

\- 0 introspective paragraphs, 0 memories or possibilities shared to the reader by the character, 0 contemplation before making any decision.

\- 0 everything.

If someone ever told me this book was sad, that would be the one most confusing statement I would ever hear because nothing about this book was sad, I would not shed air for this book, it was trash writing, and ever trashier characters (NOT Atlas). That was all it was.

Overall, TRASH.

&#x200B;

However!!!

I hope you had fun reading this rant. You can trash it with me, and we can be Trash Buddies. :)

lcco0z,Reading is getting me through the pandemic,"This has probably been said a hundred times before, but it’s 2 in the morning, I’m feeling sad, and I needed to say something.

I’ve always been a reader, but during the pandemic I’ve been reading a *lot* more. It’s helped me so much, and without this love of mine this pandemic would have been a lot more depressing than it already is. I don’t have much more to say, except this:

195mle4,Neither of my friends read (or listen to) books because because it takes too much effort. It makes me sad :(,"""N"" we'll call him. Can grind on elden ring multiple times and remember EVERY story route that he took, while also playing several other games doing the same thing.
He is very adamant about not reading, listening to, or looking at anything that isn't manga.

He reads manga only, even though i still consider that a book, i wish he was more interested in other types of books at all.
Today i tried to tell him about an audio book i listened to and he, as polite as he could, basically said that he was bored with the conversation because he wouldn't listen to it anyway.
I twisted it to a funny conversation about how the ""dramatized"" version triggered a cringe-trauma and didn't take offense.

Now ""P"", he has said before that he ""had adhd"" but doesn't anymore, i'm pretty sure thats not how it works, he is a bit of a fibber. (Pretty sure that was the most obvious truth he has told lmao)
He has zero attention span, zero desire to do anything that isn't football, and ONLY reads webbtoonz.
Specifically.
He also obviously has some of the gaming traits of N, but tbh i think N is a future game developer with how in depth he obsesses over games lol.

I haven't read a lot in my life, but books that i have started and enjoyed have left a huge impact on me.
Recently i started an audio book series on audible (for free with the trial) called The Murderbot Diaries.
Apparently i have typed that series name enough that it auto fills.
As you can tell i really like it.
I have read another series called the Night Angel trilogy. (Again auto filled lmao)

I want to share it with my friends but they aren't interested because they don't feel like listening/reading anything that isn't manga/manga like.
I love my friends so much, it just makes me sad.

P seemed a bit more interested once i showed a pic of the night angel trilogy grafic novel, but nothing has come of it intrest wise.



Edit:  Apparently, a single reddit post where i obviously am that i am leaving out some information out of respect for my friends shows exactly how we interact on a daily basis lol.
No, my friends aren't rude. No, i am not bringing it up 24/7 and have brought up individual stories before without saying it is a book with no issues.

Aside from some of the accessive comments, i did think some of them were helpful.
For my friend N, after talking with my mom about it, he may have some kind of embarrassment over reading because he thinks it is for ""smart"" people, and that he isn't smart.
From things he has told us about his personal life, that would make a lot of sense if that is why.

For my friend P, i'm pretty sure untreated adhd can make it very difficult to read. If you knew him, you would agree with me lol.

Someone in the coments said that someone they know has Aphantasia. Yes, i did copy-paste that word.
My mom seems to have that, and it makes it so difficult to read books. She says that it's like reading a long list of instructions with no end. If they both have some kind of issue like that, it would explain why they prefer manga and comics over word only books.
Tbh i think it's more likely with my friend N.
P with his adhd self is difficult to gauge what is him being adhd and what is him not actually understanding what you're saying.

For P, i'm going to see if i can find grafic novel versions of the books i have found that have themes that he likes and see if he likes those.

For N, i'm going to try to find some books that remind me of cyberpunk 2077 or other games he has inhaled knowledge of. If a bigger content creator has talked about it the better. 
He has said before that he never tries games or anime that no one has posted much about because it's not worth his time. I'm guessing because there's less fan content if it's not popular.

I'm going to look into more book content creators that are popular to see if there's a video of them geeking out over a book.

Some books that i found so far that i'm going to check out is Neuromancer and Dungeon Crawler Carl.
My dad was an ABSOLUTE fanboy of Stephen King, so i might be able to get some of that genetic knowledge and find something N would like 😂. He finds the stories about my dad awesome. I'm sure my nerdy ass dad would have already had him hooked on at least one series of King's.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/195mle4/neither_of_my_friends_read_or_listen_to_books/,2024-01-13T12:06:37Z,76,0,books,Me Before You,POST
144ctu,Can you help me pick out a book for my sister?,"I want to get her a book (preferably, but not necessarily, fiction) that will stay with her the way that Ender's Game stuck with me when I was her age (before you suggest it, she's alread read it), but I'm not sure where to start. Here's a little about my sister:

*She's 12 years old, and is in 7th grade. In our district, all of the negative aspects of school usually associated with high school (bullying, feeling out of place, DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA!) are actually much worse in middle school and she gets picked on.
*She's also one of the smartest people I know.
*She's quiet and introverted but if she feels comfortable around you, she can be crazy energetic.

sbaoh9,I feel like someone should have told me about Slaugherhouse Five,"For context: I studied Creative Writing in college, and while there, became quite interested in style -- specifically, how the medium in which you tell a story changes the story. One of my professors was very interested in this sort of thing, and was involved in numerous little projects like publishing a literary magazine on a deck of cards (a story per card). I read quite a few works that professors like him proclaimed ""would help me to understand the bounds and conventions of style,"" and such, and, indeed, a few of them were helpful.

I am quite angry that none of them showed me Vonnegut. 

Slaughterhouse Five begins with Chapter 1 -- as stories often do -- but this Chapter 1 reads like an intro, and I quickly assumed that it was Vonnegut as-author speaking, sharing his experience of writing the book. Vonnegut was an American soldier serving in WW2, and he survived the firebombing of Dresden, which killed anywhere from 30,000 to 200,000 people, as a German prisoner of war. He had written a few novels before Slaughterhouse Five, but, when asked what he was writing -- even if working on another successful and interesting book (like Cat's Cradle, which came out nearly a decade before) he said he was ""working on his Dresden book."" He had to write about it, and he establishes a few details -- like the reoccurring smell of mustard gas and roses -- and shares stories about him, his life, and the crafting of this book. 

He then starts the next chapter, which reads more as books do, beginning with the struggles of the novel's protagonist, Billy Pilgrim. And the book proceeds more-or-less as books tend to do from this point -- except in how it doesn't, because Vonnegut begins to blur whether the intro text was separate from the novel at all. Billy Pilgrim thinks in phrases that first show up in the intro -- smelling that same scent of mustard gas and roses. Vonnegut begins to break the story open -- at one point saying, as the narrator, that he was observed by Billy Pilgrim: ""That was I. That was me. That was the author of this book"" -- blurring the line between fiction and autobiography and something in-between, and it's astonishing how well it supports the ideas of this book. In the ways that Vonnegut refuses to settle for what is typically done in fiction, this book is braver than most ""experimental"" novels that are coming out today, much less its contemporaries when it was written in 1969. It's really an excellent book -- I wholeheartedly recommend it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sbaoh9/i_feel_like_someone_should_have_told_me_about/,2022-01-24T02:16:28Z,120,277,books,Me Before You,POST
hmw597,"I'm S.A. Chakraborty, author of The Daevabad Trilogy and most recently, THE EMPIRE OF GOLD. Ask me anything!","Hi Reddit! I'm a fantasy writer and giant history nerd whose books have been nominated for the Locus, World Fantasy, Crawford, and Astounding awards. When I'm not reading about thirteen-century con artists and Abbasid political intrigue, I like to garden, hike, and re-create unnecessarily complicated medieval meals. You can find me online at [sachakraborty.com](https://www.sachakraborty.com/) or on Twitter and Instagram at @SAChakrabooks, where I like to talk about history, politics, and Islamic art. Right now I'm living  in New Jersey with my husband, daughter, and a seemingly ever-increasing number of cats.

Most of my work is inspired by the medieval Islamicate world. I originally wanted to be a history professor and the Daevabad books started as this weird little world-building project I began while waiting to go back to grad school. Since THE EMPIRE OF GOLD has only been out a week, I want to keep things relatively spoiler free, but I'm happy to chat about THE CITY OF BRASS, THE KINGDOM OF COPPER, writing, world-building, the history of fantastical tales, medieval travelers, anything you wish!

EDIT: I'm at the park with my kid but will let some questions accumulate and circle back to answer in a bit

EDIT 2: I'm delighted to see all the questions but will probably skip around a bit if the topic is covered in another question and might link to some interviews if it's something I've discussed before just so we can tackle some more topics!

EDIT 3: It turns out I am incredibly slow at answering these and I'm running into family duty time. But the questions are great (thank you!) and I want to give them proper answers. I'll be back tomorrow morning!

EDIT 4: Alright, I've tried to answer as many as I could and apologies to those I didn't catch before running out of time (I have an AMA next week with Reddit Fantasy if you'd like to ask there). Thanks to everyone who participated and to Reddit Books for hosting me!

1aga1uj,Reading “The Body Keeps Score” has brought me so much peace (TW: SA),"Specially, I am referring to *The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma* by Bessel van der Kolk

Originally, I spotted this book when I was lazily browsing through Barnes&Noble. I had heard of it before and figured I’d give it a shot. 

Starting out, I found to be very  different than most popular psychology books. The author has stated that it was written specifically for a clinical audience which (imo) is refreshing to read. It’s straightforward and well researched. 

When I saw the section on remembering passed memories, I paused. The thing is, at some point in my teenaged years, I become concerned that I had been sexually abused as a child. Part of it was because I had some strange memories. Another part was some concerning physical reactions I would have to certain things. For example, I once attempted to instead a tampon, which caused me to vomit and break down in tears. I was so upset that my mother let me stay home from school that day. 

I had no memory of being touched, but it sure felt like I had been. I went searching, “was it possible to have a physical memory of something, like sexual abuse, but not remember it?” 

The answer, it seemed, was a strong: no.

I found several articles stating that things as “repressed memories” are just, easily sellable pseudoscience bullshit. Made up by therapists that push people into believing they were molested. I felt stupid for even considering it! Of course, the logic is sound. Look at studies where people were able to implant false memories in others. Look at the unreliability of witness testimony. In short, memory is malleable. Randomly remembering past sexual abuse years later is *not* possible. Therefore, I was making it up. Case closed. 

However the idea would not leave my head. And I proceeded to get worse and worse. In college I got a girlfriend, who is sweet and kind and gentle with me always. Yet the first few times, I couldn’t have sex without bursting into tears. I would occasionally have fits where I pushed her away, kicking and sobbing. I determined, that I was just mentally ill. And things like sex were very emotional and would just set me off.

Soon *anything* being “inserted” in me set me off. Getting my blood drawn at the doctors office would cause me to spiral. I would just keep thinking “the needle is inside of me it’s inside of me get it out get it out get it out-“ During two separate check ups I got up and instantly vomited in the sink. Swallowing pills also made me uncomfortable as I would “feel” it, going down my throat. 

I told myself over and over I was mentally ill. I was making up this idea of sexual abuse so I could have an “excuse” for why I was such a wreck. 

It wasn’t until I was 22 that I had a flash of a memory. A clear memory of it happening. And who was doing it. I instantly spiraled. There was no way that was real. And not him. It couldn’t have been him. I was an insane mentally ill faker 

Honestly? I picked up this book ready to disregard the idea that “the body keeps score.” It’s been disproven hasn’t it? I’m just crazy and I’m just looking for excuses. 

So I sat there on the floor of Barnes & Nobel. And for a few hours I read. 

There is something about-after wading through a laundry list of mental health bullshit articles and self help and whatever else- reading someone that gives you facts. And studies. And past experiences. Someone that gives you not only their arguments, but acknowledges and responds to counter arguments. The book also gives context for the political context in which these arguments were developed. The historical reasoning behind it and such. 

I do not think I am crazy anymore. Leaning about the scientific reasoning for trauma, the many theories we’ve discovered over the years, and how traumatic memories are processed has done so much for helping me move forward and heal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1aga1uj/reading_the_body_keeps_score_has_brought_me_so/,2024-02-01T12:39:09Z,66,424,books,Me Before You,POST
3g248p,"I'm Robin Hobb, author of the Farseer Trilogy. Ask me anything!","********** Well, it is now past 7 and I've been hammering on a keyboard for the better part of the day.  My hands are weary and it's time for me to give them a break. Thanks for some wonderful questions.  If life permits, I'll try to come back over the next few days and answer the remaining queries.  Thank you for coming here and for your interest.



Robin Hobb




Greetings and Salutations!   
 My name is Robin Hobb and I am a writer of fantasy novels (with short stories and  a bit of SF thrown in now and then.)  I am best known for the Farseer Trilogy (Assassin’s Apprentice, Royal Assassin and Assassin’s Quest.)  Those books began the adventures of Fitz and the Fool, in the Realm of the Elderlings.
Other trilogies set in that world include The Liveship Traders and The Tawny Man trilogy.  The Rain Wild Chronicles are a four volume set.  My current work is a return to the tale of the Fitz and the Fool.  Fool’s Assassin is available now.  Volume two, Fool’s Quest, will be published on August 11 in the US, and on the 13th in the UK and Australia.
I am honored to say that my work has been translated into a number of languages and is available world wide.
I also write as Megan Lindholm, though of late those works have been short form rather than novels.  My works as Megan Lindholm have been finalists for both the Nebula and the Hugo awards.  Megan’s best known novel is probably Wizard of the Pigeons, an urban fantasy set in Seattle wherein a Vietnam veteran discovers that he has been irrevocably touched by city magic.
I currently shuttle between an urban home in Tacoma and a tiny farm in Roy Washington.  We raise a lot of vegetables, grow apples, plums and grapes and enjoy the company of chickens, ducks, geese, two dogs and two cats.  I have four grown offspring, and seven grand children.
I began my writing career when I was 18, and have written while being a parent and holding down various jobs, from postal worker to electronics salesperson.  I’ve been writing and selling my writing for 45 years now, so I’ve seen the industry go from typewriters and carbon copies and SASE’s to word processors and e-zines.  It’s been a wonderful journey.
My website can be found at www.robinhobb.com  I also have a facebook, twitter, Instagram, tumblr, reddit and a newsgroup on Sff.net.  Social media has come to play a great role in writing careers.  I have a love/hate relationship with it.  
Most recent books I’ve read:  Half the World by Joe Abercrombie (Half a War is next for me!) and The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden, in galley.  I recommend both of them.
I would take it as a great personal favor if readers visited the FAQ on http://www.robinhobb.com/faq/ before posing the same questions I’ve answered a hundred times.  
And now you may Ask Me Anything!  



Today I will be back at 5 PM, Pacific Time, and  I will answer questions until 7 PM, Pacific Time.

tforcb,Diana Wynne Jones and how children’s lit got me out of a reading rut,"Hello book community! Before the pandemic and a little into it, I was in a serious reading rut. I received my BA in English literature and for many years I just stopped reading for pleasure. I felt like every book had to be literary or Very Adult. Until a few years ago. One of my favorite movies, especially animated movies, is Howls Moving Castle. I decided to read the book it was based on and I fell in love with the writing style and the characters. I then read the series and started to read more by Diana Wynne Jones. I love how she transports you into a magical world without hardly any exposition. There are wizards and witches and griffin’s that talk and without backstory you easily fall into the story

All the worlds she’s created in her series are so enchanting, reading her books makes me feel like I’m cozied up in a warm blanket with rain gently pelting outside. I feel like back when I was young and used to read, how I thought books are so magical because they transport you to imaginative spaces. It’s no wonder that Neil Gaimain and other famous authors have been inspired by her works 

All in all to say that if you’re in a reading rut, especially if you like fantasy or books that have fantastical elements, give these or other children books a try. I think people know that children’s or youth adult books can be good, hence the Newberry award, but don’t think to read them past a certain age. But in all honesty I have found some of these books I used to enjoy as a kid more fun and engaging than some recent adult fiction books",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tforcb/diana_wynne_jones_and_how_childrens_lit_got_me/,2022-03-16T18:31:43Z,69,221,books,Me Before You,POST

mfto33,Fetishizing reading metrics has trained me out of stopping and enjoying the book,"The common assumption is the more books you read, the better. That especially takes the form in a books-per-year metric; you see posts here all the time where people outline the 150 books they read in a given year and how it was such a great, enriching experience. I know many of those posts are made purely out of a passion for reading, but a lot of times it's reduced to a contest to race through as much content as possible.

As the years have gone on, I've tried to increase the number of books I read every year. I'm not going to great lengths; I think in 2015 I was at 30, and last year I read 38. So this year, I picked 40. That's immediately put me in this mindset that I have to read about a book a week, so I can give leeway to longer or more difficult reads. 

However, picking most the books I read based on ""how quickly can I read this?"" has been a drag. I still like most of what I read, but I'm choosing based on length, genre, and how contemporary/readable the prose seems. I'll log a book and it'll say I'm now one behind, so the next one has to be even more readable. And the reading itself is less fun when you're calculating ""ok, I really need to push through another 20 pages before bed or I'll fall behind.""

Earlier this month, I picked up Warlock, by Oakley Hall. It's a great read. The prose is excellent, the characters have great depth, and I'm excited to see it all unfold in front of me. 

But last night, two weeks in, I cracked page 100. Of \~470. I'm enjoying it. I'm not putting it off. It's just a slow read, pure and simple. 

I want to get back to reading on a whim, and just letting the book I'm in be the book I'm in. Heck, maybe this year I'll just read two more books.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mfto33/fetishizing_reading_metrics_has_trained_me_out_of/,2021-03-29T16:43:03Z,122,328,books,Me Before You,POST
mdgz2z,"I recently started Great Expectations (Charles Dickens, 1861) and there's a quote that hit me harder than anything I've read in a long time.","Granted, I haven't been reading a ton recently. I moved pretty far from home a couple months ago and brought a box of books with me - mostly favorites but also a few I've owned for a while but never read, thinking I'd make the effort to finally read them. One of those was Great Expectations. I was talking to my sister on the phone a couple weeks ago and she saw a quote posted on FB that made her think of something I'd said, so she shared it with me. And guess where it was from? Great Expectations! So I took that as a sign that I needed to start it.


Here's the quote, which is the last paragraph of chapter 9 (also, this was NOT the quote my sister shared with me; I haven't gotten to that one yet):


“That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it is the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it, and think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.”


This really hit me - like it made me very emotional very suddenly and the tears started flowing, and it took me a minute to regain my composure. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before so it felt really strange. Several months ago I met somebody while traveling who sort of changed my perspective on things, and if I hadn't met them I don't think I would have had the courage to make the move I did and wouldn't be where I am currently. It was such a chance encounter that sparked this whole wave of changes and reading that quote just made me think if that day hadn't happened how different my life could be.


Does this strike a chord with anybody else?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mdgz2z/i_recently_started_great_expectations_charles/,2021-03-26T04:47:54Z,99,777,books,Me Before You,POST

I wrote the First Law trilogy: The Blade Itself, Before They are Hanged, Last Argument of Kings, then three standalone books in the same world: Best Served Cold, The Heroes, and Red Country.  More recently I wrote the Shattered Sea trilogy, set in a different world and aimed partly at young adults: Half a King, Half the World, and Half a War.

28ywwd,I can't believe it took me 23 years to read The Count of Monte Cristo!,"I'm a big fan of classics, so when I found out my wife's favorite book ever was The Count of Monte Cristo, I was intrigued as to why. Of course I had heard of it before back in literature class in high school, but I never had been motivated to pick it up and read it. I guess I thought I'd be missing out on several books by reading this one instead since, unabridged, it clocks in at over 1200 pages. Let me just say, I am so glad I finally worked up the courage to start, because, once I did, I couldn't put it down. I was dead to the rest of the world. The story is absolutely beautiful, and I really feel like Edmond Dantes exemplified a great literary hero we can all appreciate. Also, I have really enjoyed getting to know my wife better by reading and loving her favorite book. I don't mean to ramble, but after finishing The Count, I felt impelled to post to encourage anyone out there to pick it up and read it. It might seem like you aren't getting anywhere at first, and even in the middle, but the plot will unfold beautifully and you will be left extremely satisfied, and probably sad the story is only 1200 pages. You will not be disappointed!

1batjd7,The House Across the Lake made me never want to read Riley Sager ever again,"“The House Across the Lake” by Riley Sager starts pretty interesting but as you keep reading, it starts to drag on. I felt several chapters going back and forth between “Before” and “Now” were repetitive. It took way too long for a real plot twist to happen as this was a slog to get through between the 20% - 70% mark of this novel._x000D_  
_x000D_  
I felt that many situations involving the main protagonist’s drinking adventures, Casey, could have been truncated to make this novel tighter and a better read. A lot of these situations kept repeating themselves and honestly felt like fluff to me. This novel could have easily been about 100 pages shorter and it would have been a better reading experience. It starts creepy, fizzles out tremendously for a huge chunk of the novel, and by the time things get creepy again, it happens a lot later than it should have._x000D_  
_x000D_  
When it comes to the dialogue and conversations between characters, I also noticed that a lot of things continued to be repeated to the point where I started to get frustrated because it’s a recurring theme. I’m all about a great story and the development of characters, but why explain a situation and then have that same situation repeated all over again in dialogue? I kept saying to just get to the point already and again, stop dragging things on._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but towards the end when things finally get interesting, it does get boring because again, Sager keeps fleshing the obvious out to the point of no control. I wish things were edited down a bit and made sure that every word counted, not elaborate on every little thing three or four times over just to add more pages for the sake of adding more pages._x000D_  
_x000D_  
When it came to the ending, I also felt it was unrealistic considering what went down with the lake and what eventually gets revealed. It’s like reading two different stories when it would have been better to simply stick to the creepiness of the lake and run with that, not trying to jam in something else that didn’t need to be added in. It just felt very unbelievable and took me out of the reading experience entirely, which I’ve dealt with in the past with Sager in “Survive the Night” with unrealistic situations and endings that would never, ever happen in the real world._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Overall, I give “The House Across the Lake” by Riley Sager a 2/5 as I did enjoy the plot twists but they came way too late. I wish more was explained about Lake Greene to wrap things up and not have all this fluff that just made for a mostly boring reading experience. I should have learned from “Survive the Night” but make no mistake about it, I am done with reading anything Sager writes from here on out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1batjd7/the_house_across_the_lake_made_me_never_want_to/,2024-03-09T22:03:07Z,44,63,books,Me Before You,POST
tsk0h5,"I recently read my first Joe Abercrombie book, and have just started my first Brian Sanderson book and the stylistic contrast is giving me literary whiplash","For those not in the know Abercrombie has a very sparse, direct style. He describes things simply, and his characters don't spend time talking about things they already know for the benefit of the reader. This shows a great deal of respect for the reader's intelligence, and help makes the world feel deeper. On the other hand he takes the concept so far as to be sometimes confusing and frustrating for me. The Clearly Important Thing will get mentioned, and people will agree it is indeed a Clearly Important Thing but the reader doesn't get any elaboration. 

In contrast Sanderson is... I'm going to go with 'florid' but not necessarily in a bad way? Description! Info dumps! All the adjectives! Fantasy vocab lessons! Why is that a Clearly Important Thing? Well, dear reader, let me give you a couple paragraphs so you, too can appreciate its Clear Importance. 

I'm not saying either style is better or worse, and I'm not far enough into the Sanderson book to make any kind of judgement, just that difference stark and really in your face.

Before that I mostly wrote as Mike Carey. I’ve written a lot of comics, including Lucifer, The Unwritten, X-Men and Hellblazer – and currently Darkness Visible, from IDW. I’ve also written several novels under that name: the Felix Castor series, a couple of mainstream thrillers and two collaborations with my wife Linda and our daughter Louise, The City Of Silk and Steel and The House Of War and Witness.

I would love to talk books, movies, comics and stories in general with you. But the invitation is: ask me anything. So if you want a good recipe for guacamole, you can ask that too and I will just totally make something up. It probably won't taste great, I warn you now.

1aerhir,What does Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood tell me on my second read?,"The first time I read 'Norwegian Wood', I was barely a foot inside the chaotic mess that was my college life. I was 19 and volatile - it should have been a perfect book to pick up. 

It was. In some ways. In some ways, it was a much better read this time round, 6 years later, aeons of people looking over my shoulder, aeons of people left behind. 

I do believe you cannot get all that a good book has to offer in a single skimming through. You need to read it twice. At least. Let it sink. Let it stay. 

Some things don't change of course. Yes this book still has its setbacks, its controversial bits, its exasperating moments. It still has more sex than is palatably needed. But it now also has undertones I never before paid attention to. 

""Death exists, not as the opposite but as a part of life."" 

6 years have gone by, I've lost my Kizuki, and nothing is the same anymore. Not the book. Not the world. Not death.

196aun4,“The Body” by Stephen King is helping me get back into reading,"
I started reading “The Body” by Stephen King, and absolutely intend to finish this one! I knew before starting it that I have seen the famous film adaptation (“Stand By Me”) of this novel before. This is a short story, which is partly why I chose it (since I return to school on the 22nd and have a job, I have decided that reading stories that aren’t lengthy is probably in my best interest until summer starts.) I have to say that I am really enjoying this book so far! I wouldn’t describe it as being a “lighthearted” novel, though I’d say that it is an easy read and that as always I am really enjoying reading the novel as there are more small details that help me understand the characters, their backstories, and their motivations so much better (not quint that the film adaptation starring River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Wil Wheaton isn’t great, it is - it’s just that I feel like the book gives you a better feel for what the town of Castle Rock is like, whereas the film, while truly a great adaptation - I mean I was literally reading the first  few chapters in Wil Wheaton’s voice - feels lighter, in spite of everything, in the beginning. The film feels more nostalgic so far than the novel does.) I also think it’s interesting that the short story is set in 1960 as opposed to 1959, even though I know there wasn’t realistically a bit difference between those two years - from my understanding, 1960 felt like a continuation of the 50s fashion and culture wise… it just makes me wonder why the film directors chose summer of 1959 as opposed to what seems to be summer of 1960 in the novel. Was it specifically to appeal to those who were nostalgic over the 50s back in the 80s?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/196aun4/the_body_by_stephen_king_is_helping_me_get_back/,2024-01-14T08:00:45Z,3,8,books,Me Before You,POST

That peculiar, and perhaps old-fashioned use of 'should' really beats me. What does the author mean by the second clause? Which of the two interpretations below would be closer to the author's intended meaning of the sentence?

1) “Welcome or not, I had to be part of a group so that I would not start talking to complete strangers.”

2) ""Welcome or not, I had to find someone to stand next to before starting to speak to the people walking past.""

Specifically in Medieval Russia (as in, before Ivan the Terrible). The novel centers around a noble family’s daughter who becomes intertwined in the world of magical household spirits that most people overlook. 

To my parents’ dismay, I decided to utilize my double degree in Russian and French to become a hobo macadamia nut farmer and aspiring real estate agent in Hawaii. Something about the beautiful sunny beaches there inspired me to write a novel in which multiple characters almost die from the harsh Russian winter. While it started as just a fun project, I decided to stick with it and now my book is out and people tell me it’s pretty good!  Since living in Hawaii, I’ve bounced around a bit and am now answering your questions from Vermont, where I live in a barn and spend most of my time writing next to a wood stove.

1as101c,Scott Sigler's best book (Alive) and why it makes me sad,"I was digging around my Kindle library to pick my next book and I saw this and I thought what the hell, I love that book. And halfway through I looked at my bookshelf and I remembered that I own this entire trilogy in hardcover, why the hell did I buy this ebook even if I'm sure I only spent a couple dollars on it.

Scott Sigler is a mid-list horror and SF author who does a lot of social media promotion and was an early adopter (possibly founder) of the method of putting out fiction as a podcast in order to grow an audience and get publishing deals. This is where I found him in the mid-aughts as a poor college student who wanted audiobooks and I've followed him ever since, even if not always closely. A lot of his books are really detail oriented and ""scientific"" as long as you understand that scientific is being used to mean the way science works in the world of the story. He's generally good at it, I've listened to him on and off for 15 years or more and own multiple hardcopies. But his protagonists tend to be a little dry and often angry, because he's a tiny white guy who was the son of a State level football coach and he has (admitted and dealt with) anger issues. 

Alive is probably his best book. It's a dystopian-horror YA novel about a young woman who wakes up in a stone box with a needle stabbing at her and she fights her way free and then goes on to lead the rest of the young people she finds to a massive victory over things that can't be explained without massive spoilers. And no one has any memory of anything before the first words on the page and it's full of self-doubt from the narrator and it's just excellent. It's written for a younger audience so it's not full of profanity like some of his other books, but it doesn't sacrifice anything for that and because no one in the protagonist group knows ANYTHING about what's going on for most of the story he gets out of his own fucking way and doesn't explain every little tidbit in extreme detail that he sometimes does in his more adult writing. 

I remember listening to the podcast version back when it first came out and I mistimed it so I started before it was finished and I would have needed to wait a few weeks for the rest of the story but the book was out. I was like ""Fuck that"" and just bought the hardcover because it was so gripping. And it is. And I bought the sequels when they came out because I didn't want to wait for the weekly podcast drops. This is his best book and his best series and I am incredibly sad that it didn't sell well enough to really take off and he went back to writing more detail oriented horror-SF stuff. I highly recommend reading this book, it truly is excellent and the rest of the series is also very good but it does get more involved with his other novels as it goes. 

What makes me sad is that while this book got a push from the publisher and was released at the tail end of the Hunger Games hype, it didn't sell well enough for Scott to continue writing in this style. Or for him to continue experimenting with his writing. The books he's sold since Alive have been pretty much what he was writing when he debuted. Better versions of that style, but still that style. He's a good author and I like what he writes, but he has the potential to be so much better and I don't blame him for it because it doesn't make financial sense but I still want him to write something else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1as101c/scott_siglers_best_book_alive_and_why_it_makes_me/,2024-02-16T05:32:07Z,21,1,books,Me Before You,POST

195t45v,Speculation about the world created in Never Let Me Know by Kazuo Ishiguro,"This book is masterfully written and there have been many great discussions about it that I’ve been looking at. 

I do find myself still speculating about the actual world the book creates and logistical things. I know these things don’t matter so much thematically, but I’m still curious what other people think.

Who do you think they used as models for the clones? Ruth thinks they use homeless junkies from “the gutter”, but I don’t know if that makes a ton of sense. You’d think in a system like this people would make clones of themselves to later use the organs. There would be no worries about rejection of the clone was identical to the recipient. 

Though if it were that, I would expect the people themselves would care to some degree how the clones were raised. It’s easier for society to accept this system if they are more removed from it and the donors are nameless faceless entities they don’t have to think much about. Maybe people volunteer to be cloned? Maybe they are paid? Maybe it happens all in secret and no one knows if they have a clone out there?

The characters wonder if their models are the same age or if there is a delay. Which do you think makes more sense? It depends on why exactly they need the organs. Does everyone in this society have organ failure problems? Is there something about the environment or what they do to themselves that make it so everyone would eventually need replacement organs? Or is it just a contingency plan if you happen to develop an illness? 

This leads me to question how many clones are actually out there? One for each person? If there were that many, I would expect some kind of clone rebellion in this world. They’d have the numbers. So I think there are not enough for every person and they’re kept separate from each other and raised in such a way they’d not question their lives deeply at all. 

I wonder if any clones anywhere, if not from Hailsham, from the worse facilities that are referenced at the end, ever tried to escape. What would that look like in your opinion? It’s not realistic that it would never happen somewhere. I assume they had a plan to deal with rogue clones like that and it probably involves keeping them in solitary confinement while their organs were harvested. Our characters would have no knowledge of this, but I have to believe bad things would happen to anyone who tried to escape. 

Do you think England was the only country doing this or it was widespread?

 They talk about the organ donation system curing cancer, but what organ replacements would cure cancer? Only certain types in the very early stages I would assume. 

One of my persistent questions during the whole novel was wondering which organs they were donating and still remaining able to get around. Kidneys, liver, bone marrow? What are the three organs they’d be able to donate before the fourth donation that would mean “completion”? It sounded like the fourth one was the last one they would be cognizant of, but the rest of their organs would continue to be taken while they were on life support. Would the heart be the fourth, or maybe the last?

I hope my questions don’t sound like I didn’t “get” the book. I really did and it was a brutal read. Very thought provoking about humanity and these characters who felt so real. I just find myself thinking about the world itself and how realistic or unrealistic it is. How do you imagine the world they were living in? 

This book will stay with me a long time. Every time Kathy would say “I don’t know how it was for you, but at Hailsham…” it was like she was talking directly to the reader and asking us to reflect on our own lives and society. Powerful stuff.

196mhei,Reading new books makes me feel guilty part 2,"Update on my last post (skim through that if you don't want to get lost)

I read 6 more books before 2023 ended! After i practically forced myself to start another book, i realized the problem was that I just read really fkin good ones. In my last post, I talked about a trilogy that I read in the beginning of 2023 that basically got me in a reading slump the rest of the year. 

Nov. 30, i finally managed to pick up a standalone. Read it in a day. Boom. Another reading slump and my heart was torn to shreds. So a week later (?) I decide to read a book impulsively because ive heard a lot about it and I've seen the author's name floating around online a couple times. 

The book was ok...And I just kept reading. 5 books later, and I realized the problem. I just needed a pallet cleanser. And that pallet cleanser was a cheap Wattpad wannabe with a writing style that would make my high school English teacher cry. 

I also noticed that buying and reading the physical copy helps since I'd have a ""reminder"" of the story when i finish it. This way, i wouldn't really feel like I'm abandoning that part of me when I move on to a new book or story. I'll definitely regret figuring this out cause now I realize how quickly the costs start to pile up. Since when we're books so fkin expensive??

m22kus,"I’m novelist Nicole Galland, and I love to nerd out about time travel, magic, and Shakespeare. Ask me anything!","My new novel, Master of the Revels, is the eagerly-awaited sequel to The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O., the New York Times bestseller I co-wrote with Neal Stephenson. You needn’t have read the prequel before diving in to Revels, though, and you needn’t have read Master of the Revels to Ask Me Anything on March 10th!

When I’m not working on time-travel stories, you can find me writing medieval or Renaissance-era historical fiction. But I’ve also written some lighthearted contemporary novels - so I’m opinionated in a range of genres. I’ve got a background in theatre, I’m certified Shakespeare nerd, and also – no kidding – a former X-wing fighter pilot.

In Master of the Revels, an Irish witch is using time travel to erase modern technology. She’s got multiple schemes all going at once, sending her adversaries (aka our heroes) to Renaissance Florence, Roman-era Sicily, and Jacobean London - where she embeds real witchcraft into Shakespeare’s Macbeth. Our heroes must first figure out what she’s up to, and then stop her - before she kills them. 
 
It’s a fun way to inhabit fascinating time periods from a modern POV. It’s also the ultimate background for what-if scenarios. (My favorite being: if one mistreated slave’s escape to freedom could endanger the future of humanity, should you help them escape?)

xrckyx,"Heya folks! I'm Sunyi, autistic sff author of THE BOOK EATERS, and you can ASK ME ANYTHING (until this thread gets archived…!)","PROOF: https://i.redd.it/ol2ieypgzaq91.jpg

Hi Reddit! My debut, THE BOOK EATERS, came out via Tor (usa) and Harper Voyager (uk) back in august 2022. It's the third book I've written, but the first one I've managed to get published. It is a standalone, not a series, and sold as contemporary fantasy—but be warned, there is little to no magic in it. 

So far, bad reviews say it's a violent clusterf*ck, while positive reviews say it's super weird (in a good way). I put to you that both of those things are true 😅 Another bewildered reviewer described it as a fairytale stapled to a thriller, and I lowkey love that.

In all seriousness, I would class THE BOOK EATERS as a modern gothic fairytale. Partly, it explores a warped society of humanoid people who eat books, and some who eat minds. The rest of it follows a (book eater) single mom MC in her highly personal quest to save her (mind eater) monstrous son. 

For folks who are unsure if they'll like it, I recommend reading the first couple of chapters (free on the internet, see links below) and evaluating based off that. 

Addendum: I plan to reply to the thread until it's archived, or folks stop responding. Or reddit closes it, lol. My reasoning is that a lot of people won't have had a chance to hear about the book yet, let alone read it, so the thread will remain as a resource that folks can access for the next few months.


BIO THINGS:

I'm a biracial autistic sff writer who was born in Texas, grew up in Hong Kong, and now live in the UK. I love New Weird spec fic, 19th century lit, science fantasy genre benders, and have a Gene Wolfe tattoo, although I don't write anything like him.

I like running, wildswimming, hiking, gaming (video/table top/board) and of course, reading, but I am not a very useful kind of person in the capitalist sense. I have spent most of my adult life unemployed / FT carer for my kids, who have special needs, and until the book deal came through, we lived at or below the poverty line. 

I found querying and submission to be brutal, but actual publishing to be brilliant and life-changing. Definitely feel free to ask about that side of it—the publishing industry has become my special interest, and I collect SO MUCH info.

14f8top,"The so-called disability ""representation"" in the Cursebreaker trilogy disappoints me","Before I get downvoted if this post somehow gets more attention than I thought, I still really enjoy this work of Brigid Kemmerer, the one thing I dislike is the representation of cerebral palsy. I do not have cerebral palsy myself, and I'm not offended or anything for people who do have it, nor do I wanna attempt to boycott the series (because I do really enjoy everything else about it), this is just a small rant about my disappointment in the representation it got so much praise for.

For those who do not know, the Cursebreaker trilogy is by Brigid Kemmerer and is made up of *A Curse so Dark and Lonely*, *A Heart so Fierce and Broken*, and *A Vow so Bold and Deadly*. This mention is just in case you'd recognize any of the titles. If you haven't read the books, the FMC, Harper, has cerebral palsy. Before I bought and read the trilogy, I saw a *lot* of praise on booktok and youtube for it because Harper has cerebral palsy. I was excited to read it after hearing that as I haven't had a book with much disability representation, but as soon as I started reading it, I was heavily disappointed. Harper's cerebral palsy is a limp, nothing else. It doesn't even affect her plot-wise or anything, just mildly inconveniences her maybe five times? She's still considered ""beautiful"" in modern-day society, and as said the disability never negatively affects her besides the limp. Representation is still representation and I'm sure Brigid Kemmerer was going out of her comfort zone, but idk, I was expecting more I guess when I heard disability representation.

I don't know if it's just this instance where the author is afraid to do more severe cases when it comes to disabilities, or if this was just a choice that was made to make an MC have a flaw, but I feel if it can be removed from the story easily, it doesn't have to be in the story at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14f8top/the_socalled_disability_representation_in_the/,2023-06-21T14:11:26Z,10,12,books,Me Before You,POST
bq57bu,"This is the worst book I've ever read, and it's being praised like no other. Is it me?","^(Edit, disclaimer: I don't hate the book, and I'm happy for the author that she got published, and I'm also happy there are others who do enjoy it. There's not a shred of resentment in me; only confusion.)


_Dear Friend, From My Life I Write To You In Your Life_ is the most empty thing I've ever read, and it's being praised as if it's another one of Camus'. It pisses me off to no end, because although it starts off very strongly, and although its prose is of quite a pleasant nature, the second page in it deteriorates into pseudo-philosophy, asking questions and raising topics that aren't further discussed, making it seem like all the critics only read the first page and judged it fantastic. It feels like the guy at the dinner table quoting Camus when asked what he'd like to drink, if that makes any sense.


I want to know your thoughts on the matter to figure out if it's just me.


The book begins with twenty four short, numbered paragraphs of which the topics swing about with no resolutions whatsoever. I'm talking tweet-sized sections here, so there's no time to think, alright? Just get in, loser, because we're going fast. 


Number one: MC is reminiscing on the first time she saw before-and-after photos after migrating to America, and she reflects on how definitive this concept seems—as if there's a clear distinction between what one was and what one is, and that therefore there is the possibility of leaving past mistakes behind. A stellar analogy by the author, and a cast iron ground for what seems to promise a great work of literature. 


Nope. 


Paragraph two cuts in without any further mention of the above: an acquaintance called, MC's husband met the woman, he brought her to the airport, and two weeks later the woman had jumped out of a window. MC doesn't visit the funeral.


Okay.


""Our memories tell more about now than then,"" MC continues right after, god knows why, and as if this is something about which everyone is in unison. ""Doubtless the past is real,"" she then proclaims. Over two millennia of philosophy settled right then and there, ladies and gentlemen. 


Paragraph three: past, present, and future are not one and the same MC explains. Roger. 


Paragraph four. MC is staying at a hospital for the second time. The first isn't mentioned, because why would it? MC then channels a bit of Freddie in telling that she too at times wishes not to have ever been born. Being alone in her thoughts, she then feels a 'collective sigh': her tears seemed to prove something. 


What on earth is a collective sigh in the first place, and how on earth can she experience one when she's precisely alone in a basement room? Her words, mind you; not mine!


But forget about all of this, because paragraph five, and everyone in MC's life apparently wonders what she's hiding: her mother, a bathhouse employee, and apparently that makes up everyone MC knows. If you're now wondering where the hell this is coming from, then welcome to the club: why would people think this; why would they ask this; why are we told about this? 


Next! Number six makes sure we're aware that there are five time zones in China—MC's country of birth—and that the whole nation uses one, unified zone. She reflects that time is ingrained in all our experiences and memories, and wonders how many of us have ever wished to have had a bit more time... The ellipse is not my addition. 


I could go on and on, but I'll spare you the other eighteen tweets, along with all the unfinished thoughts, philosophically interesting but otherwise out of place questions that are never actually further reflected upon, shallow references to Dostoevsky with no further weight to them, abruptly ended paragraphs, frequently strange and sometimes flawed interpunction, and at times even unfinished sentences. I wish I was being hyperbolic with that last one, but I'm not. I quote: ""Your roommate, several women said to me, eyeing her torn paper gown and oblivious half-nakedness when she moved about in the hallway, where we all sat on sofas or chairs, socializing as we had been encouraged to do."" What about this roommate? Why did these women bring her up? Now, you might think that perhaps the period was meant to be a comma and that what is now the next sentence would then have finished the first. That's very sharp of you, and very charitable, because nope: next paragraph. 


I shit you not; that actually happened: an unfinished sentence that raised several questions was the last sentence of a fucking paragraph. 


Please, for the love of literatue, can someone helpe out here? This book with a phenomenal title, a fantastic first page, and oftentimes even prose that makes me envious in ways I've rarely felt before—this book has won The Guardian's First Book Award, despite all of the above. 


And mind you: this is all only thirty pages in, and that with a font size that overly respects the far-sighted. 


Someone tell me what I'm missing here. Please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bq57bu/this_is_the_worst_book_ive_ever_read_and_its/,2019-05-18T15:30:12Z,115,135,books,Me Before You,POST
4lgatd,"Hey, y’all. I’m independent author Bryan Perkins and I recently published my first audiobook, *Murder in “Utopia,,*. Ask me anything about the audiobook creation process, writing in general, or any of life’s deepest mysteries. This is my [Author Spotlight].","Thanks for joining me, y’all. My name’s Bryan Perkins and I write revolutionary fiction--that’s fiction which explores the politics, history, and future of revolutionary theory. If you want some proof of who I am, you can find it on [my website here](https://bryanperkinsauthor.com/2016/05/28/ask-me-anything-about-anything-for-my-rbooks-author-spotlight-ama/), on [my Twitter account here](https://twitter.com/BPerkinsAuthor/status/736585052591525888), or on [my Facebook page here](https://www.facebook.com/BryanPerkinsAuthor/posts/1675113216087822). 

Most recently I published my first audiobook, [*Murder in “Utopia,,*](http://i.imgur.com/WzOSJEi.png), which follows a priest and a psychiatrist as they discuss the lives of the clients they meet in their day-to-day business as a therapist and a confessional receiver in utopia. The actor who narrated the audiobook, Julie Hoverson, did a superb job of interpreting an admittedly difficult novella and she deserves as many listens as she can get, so do think about picking up a copy if you can. [Here’s a review from someone who read the novella](https://bryanperkinsauthor.com/2016/01/05/new-review-of-murder-in-utopia/) before it was possible to have the pleasure of listening to it--which I highly recommend.

Other than that I’ve been working on an epic dystopian science fiction series, called [Infinite Limits](https://bryanperkinsauthor.com/about-infinite-limits/), for a few years now. The first three out of four books have all been published, and I’m currently writing the fourth and final book in the series. For anyone who’s interested, here are links to two reviews of the first book in the series, [*The Asymptote’s Tail*](https://bryanperkinsauthor.com/about-infinite-limits/about-the-asymptotes-tail/), the first [review written by Marxist historian and lecturer Doug Greene](https://bryanperkinsauthor.com/2015/07/10/a-review-of-the-asymptotes-tail-by-doug-greene/) and the second [review written by Michael Adkins of the Nerds on Earth](http://www.nerdsonearth.com/2015/09/book-review-asymptotes-tail-review/). This way you can get a feel for the novel from both the political and the science fiction perspectives, two aspects I try to blend in all my work.

I’d say that’s more than enough of an introduction, though, so let’s get to any questions any of you might have. I’m open to talk about writing, publishing, the audiobook creation process, or any of the more political aspects of my books or the world in general--anything really--so feel free to ask away. And if you find you’re interested in the Infinite Limits series, *Murder in “Utopia,,*, or any of my future works, please do join what few of us there are at /r/InfiniteLimits to keep up to date and to discuss advances in both revolutionary and STEM theories and technologies.

Thanks for having me, y’all. I look forward to your questions. We do nothing alone.

[**Edit:** This has been great, y'all. Thanks for all the interesting questions. I'm taking a short break for some food right now, but I'm always on reddit so feel to ask away and I'll do my best to get to every single question asked.]",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4lgatd/hey_yall_im_independent_author_bryan_perkins_and/,2016-05-28T15:47:22Z,111,722,books,Me Before You,POST
ghgyby,Brandon Sanderson was highly recommended to me so I decided to check out Stormlight Archives. My thoughts.,"So just a preamble - I don't read a ton of fantasy. I've read your usual suspects like LOTR, Harry Potter and ASOIAF, as well as assorted works by Neil Gaiman, Guy Gavriel Kay, Patricia McKillip, Gene Wolfe and Ursula K Le Guin. Also love all of Robin Hobb's works (probably my favourite fantasy author). But that's pretty much the extent of my experience with the genre, unless you count my aborted attempt at Wheel of Time (less said about that, the better). I had attempted Mistborn a long time ago and gave up halfway because I didn't like it much. But Stormlight is always recommended around these parts so I thought I'd give it a shot - it's rated very highly both here and on Goodreads.

I did finish all 3 books out in the series so far. Overall, I have to say that I'm honestly pretty disappointed and underwhelmed. Maybe it's on me because my expectations were really high after reading all the praise, but Stormlight didn't do it for me.

I'll start with what I did like. The worldbuilding - pretty cool. This aspect was well done. The universe created in the books is expansive and pretty interesting with its own unique ecology. It felt both familiar and alien. I found it fairly immersive and that aspect honestly got me through most of the series. I liked most of the lore, the different cultures etc. Good stuff here. 

The action scenes - also fairly well done. Even though they can get a bit cartoonish and video gamey at times (I think there was one point in the 3rd book when one of the characters was literally flying around in the air which I found unintentionally hilarious). But still, Sanderson has an eye for epic set pieces and for the most part, they're also well done.

Everything else though - not good. I'll start with the prose as that seems to be one of the main points of contention for Sanderson. I get that the purpose of these books is not to be literary or have colourful, poetic or lyrical wordplay, but man, it's just so wooden and by the numbers. Here you have this unique, crazy fantasy world, the kind that almost begs for a fancy turn of phrase to evoke some wonderful imagery or emotion - but nothing. It's like reading an instruction manual, just an outline of things that happen. Which got me to thinking that maybe I'm not the right audience for these books. 

Second issue is with the characters. I get that this is your typical epic, heroic fantasy and characters need to conform to a certain kind of archetype but some development would have been nice, especially over the course of 3,000 pages or so. I found it hard to be invested in any of the main characters, with the exception of maybe Dalinar and Jasnah. Kaladin reminded me of every angsty shonen anime hero out there, and the less said about Shallan, the better. It's like Sanderson has never met a young teenage girl in his life before. Lift and Wit were fairly cringeworthy as well but thankfully they weren't very prominent throughout the story. Character interactions and dialogue all felt a little...off? Like very artificial and wooden, even by the standards of tropey epic fantasy. 

The plot was...ok I guess. Honestly, the backstory and lore are more interesting than the actual present day narrative. There are a lot of moving parts but I felt like in the end, it's all coming down to yet another good vs evil showdown with powerful teenagers holding the fate of the world in their hands. I feel like I've seen this in a hundred different anime before and it's giving me serious deja vu. 

Thematic content: not much there. There's some attempt at examining mental illness in the 3rd book which I personally found pretty superficial and unconvincing but YMMV - it might hit closer for some people than others. Otherwise, there's not a lot here to dig into under the surface. Also, is it just me or do these books seem weirdly asexual? I'm not saying that every fantasy book needs to be some grimdark tome full of tits and fucking but it just seems really...squeaky clean I guess? It's strange because there's actually quite a bit of violence but characters never engage in anything more than a hug from what I can recall. Sanderson seems a little prudish. I'm not sure if these books are supposed to be YA or not but that's the impression I got.

So overall - personally speaking, I don't see the hype behind these books. Ok, I *see* it - it's basically a MCU movie in prose form, very accessible and light, and entertaining enough. But when I see them being called best fantasy ever - just makes no sense, even from someone who hasn't read everything in the genre. 

I don't regret my time reading them or anything but I'm left with an impression of ""eh"". I was expecting to be blown away but maybe that's where I made a mistake. I feel like I'll probably get downvoted heavily for this thread though.

What are your thoughts on Stormlight?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ghgyby/brandon_sanderson_was_highly_recommended_to_me_so/,2020-05-11T04:42:51Z,193,155,books,Me Before You,POST
oluit2,"""Never Let Me Go"" by Kazuo Ishiguro, I simply don't know what I feel about this one.","So I just finished this book, an hour ago I think. I liked it, it's well written, easy to read too, and I was quite captivated by the story.

This is narrated by Kathy H., a woman who is going over her life and memories in an attempt to ""come to to terms with them"". It's really hard for me to say exactly what I feel about this, not because it makes me undescribably happy or sad, just because it's causing a very specific feeling within me (or a bunch of different feelings) that I don't know how to describe. 

I enjoyed it. I think that, in many ways, it's quite scary and harrowing simply because of the world it takes place in. There's a certain element about this world that distinguishes it from our own, but I didn't feel like it was presented as an eventually big plot twist that would make you gasp. It's more like a slow realization and then a shock that you come to terms with and then leaves you thinking for a while about how inhumane it is. Raising kids for organ harvest, essentially.

But it doesn't focus on that. Kathy instead focuses on her life, her memories, relationships, etc., and I think the reason why she does this makes a lot more sense once you've reached the end. She's a clone destined for death, she's already accepted that and this story isn't about her and her friends trying to escape this. It's normal to them, this is just the wa.y things are and that's that.

From what I understand now, she goes over her life and her various memories (and a lot of these moments are inevitably tied in to her fate) to maybe make it more real, to hang on it as much as she can, just to reminisce about her life. Even this I find super hard to explain, I don't know why. I think it's maybe really about that, just reminiscing and remembering her life, relationships, etc. 

I like that it doesn't focus on the cloning aspect of the world it's set in, it makes for something different. I've seen a lot of reviews saying that this is THE big plot twist but that's it's a really disappointing one. I think it was never meant to be a massive twist. It's just introduced to you, Kathy talks about it as if it's a normal thing (which it is to her) and that's it. She doesn't talk about how shocking it is. It's just her life and that's that.

I did enjoy this book, I liked the writing and I thought jt was very captivating. It was like sitting down with a friend and having a one-sided conversation or listening to their story. Something that I think I take away from it is that life is precious. People like Kathy are destined for death, and while we are as well, in a way, we have much more freedom with our own lives. It's important to make the most of them before we do die. I think that's what I can take away from this. 

I'd really love to know what other people's thoughts on this are as I really am unable to formulate my own into words, for some reason.

1oi89s,"A little over one year ago, this subreddit helped me go from obscure nobody to selling over 70,000 copies of my books. I'm back to answer questions and give away some books, so please AMA!","I'm Mike Kraus, and a little over a year ago, I made a post here giving away a bunch of copies of my [first fiction work](http://amzn.com/B008F447PC) that I published to Amazon's Kindle platform. For some reason that I still can't fathom, it took off, and my Final Dawn series has sold well over 70,000 copies (I last added up the numbers a couple months ago). I finally published the last book in the Final Dawn series and recently published a new book, [Cold Springs](http://amzn.com/B00FJ6FJZG) that's a sort of teaser intro to a new universe of novels that I'm developing that's best described as a cross between the Dresden Files and Warehouse 13. 

Before I wrote Final Dawn, I did a lot of stuff from coding to web design, but writing is pretty much my full-time occupation now. Please feel free to ask me anything about my writing process, the frustrations/benefits of the KDP platform, my books or anything else!

Oh, and I asked the mods if I could give away some books, and they said okay, so I'm going to do it! Last time I did it, I compiled emails from PMs here on Reddit, but the mods suggested I use email instead, so let's do that. If you send me an email to **mike AT mikekrausbooks.com** with the subject line of ""Reddit Book Giveaway"" I'll add your email to a big spreadsheet and then randomly select 100 people to get copies of Final Dawn (the whole trilogy) and Cold Springs. I'll send the books as Amazon gifts throughout the AMA, and you can read them on pretty much any device (there are Kindle reading apps for everything). I plan to be here from now till around 5PM CST answering questions and sending the books out.

Okay, I'll shut up now and let you guys talk. :)

6e3fer,"[Discussion] ""If you were to pick yourself apart with tweezers, one atom at a time, you would produce a mound of fine atomic dust, none of which had ever been alive but all of which had once been you.” A Short History of Nearly Everything just gave me a new curiosity for life.","I used to be a curious kid, but as I'm entering adulthood, I feel like that curiosity has diminished.

Luckily I read A Short History of Nearly Everything. This book brought back those feelings I used to get while watching NOVA and Bill Nye back in the day on PBS.

To me, this book felt like a literary version of Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Both of which shows us just how small we are in the universe and just how lucky we are.

I was hoping /r/books would be up for a little philosophical discussion around our purpose on this planet and what it means for our future.

I think it all starts with driving our curiosity...

#Why We All Need To Be More Curious
 
Take a step outside of yourself for a moment...
 
In fact, take a step outside of *being a human at all*.
 
Imagine for a second that *you are the universe.*
 
When you do this, you realize that us humans are completely insignificant from the perspective of the universe. Every human ever born lives and dies on a chunk of rock, rotating around the sun, rotating around the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of the billions in our infinite universe.
 
We're far less important than we think we are.
 
*And yet...*
 
**Everything had to work out exactly the way it did for us to come into existence.**
 
The Milky Way *had *to form ~12.21 billion years ago and the Earth *had *to form ~4.43 billion years ago. Our species, *Homo sapiens*, had to survive countless threats to pop up ~160,000 years ago, which is but a minor blip on the vast cosmic timeline.
 
**What makes us significant is that we're the first species to realize all of this.**
 
That's what makes us matter --- we're the species that was curious enough to ask questions and develop cognitive tools to help discover the answers.
 
#How Will You Decide To View This World?
 
We have two options for viewing our world.
 
The first viewpoint is predefined. All the questions are answered from on high, based on whichever religious doctrine we adhere to.
 
The second is undefined. All of our questions haven't been answered (and may never be) because we're acutely aware of just how much we do not know.
 
The opinion of us here at Thought Stack is simple...
 
**A life devoid of curiosity is boring.**
 
With new mind-blowing discoveries happening all the time, we need to realize there is much left to learn. Curiosity is a core trait that we need to continually cultivate.
 
You might be asking, ""Where does curiosity end? Isn't there a point at which we can rest easy?""
 
It never ends. Curiosity is the driving force behind our progression as individuals and as a species.
 
Why are we able to ask questions in the first place? If we ask it, then it needs an answer.
 
#Science Isn't The Answer To All Of Our Problems
 
If you've been paying attention, you may have noticed that there's a growing distrust of science among the public. The ""debate"" over climate change is case in point.
 
At the same time, we shouldn't venerate science and turn it into a religion of its own. Science is a tool our species created to be able to ask questions and test them in a rigorous manner. It's the shovel used to dig a hole, not the reason why you're digging the hole in the first place.
 
We tend to confuse this point. We need to understand why are we digging: to advance our species' evolution and create better lives for all of us.
 
If we invert the idea of evolution, we get regression. If we chose to do nothing and keep things exactly the way they are now, we'll waste this precious opportunity to understand ourselves and the world around us.
 
The universe wants to be understood. Otherwise, we wouldn't have the cognition to attempt it.
 
There are over seven billion people on this planet. Should we bet on a few smart people to pull us all forward as a species, or should we help the masses help us all progress?
 
#Find A Purpose
 
Our advancement as a species is enabled through automation. Technologies such as machine learning, robotics, and especially self-driving cars are going to put a huge strain on our societal structures.
 
The transition period will not be pleasant. People need meaning in their lives. Presently, work is a primary source of meaning for much of the world.
 
But if you've been a truck driver for 40 years, and self-driving cars take that entire career away from humans, what are you going to do with your time?
 
**Are you going to want to learn a new skill?** These are tough questions that need to answered fast.
 
I hope we'll be able to use this new-found time to look deeper into ourselves and discover a new sense of purpose. What if we had a universal basic income that took care of the basic needs of all individuals? Do you think our society would progress faster than its current rate?
 
Maybe part of our evolution is to* not have basic needs anymore*.
 
Could money, food, sleep, all be looked at as antiquated 100 years from now? That sounds far-fetched, but wouldn't our society look magical to people 2,000 years ago?
 
#Actionable Nugget
 
Think about how our species might progress in the next 100 years.
 
**Should we strive to advance our species? In what ways? What is your meaningful contribution?**
 
The easiest way to start is by learning a new skill. The more skills you can add to your life toolbox, the higher your probability is for advancing society in some way.
 
Scott Adams (the creator of Dilbert) calls this your Talent Stack. You don't have to be world-class in one skill to help society. You can be average at a few, but when you combine them, you become world-class in your own right.
 
Remember this: winning the lottery of being born was the luckiest you'll ever get.
 
You exist. Cash it in by doing something you feel is meaningful.

0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
 
That's one in ten million-trillion-trillion-trillionths of a second.
 
Pretty damn quick if you ask me. You know the saying if a tree falls and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? If no one was around to witness the Big Bang, might it have been the Big Silent?
 
Here's something even more mind-blowing: some scientists believe that Big Bangs are common. What makes this one special is that we were able to live in it. However, before we get to us humans, let's take a closer look at the roundish rock that supports all life in the universe (as far as we know).
 
## Gravity Keeps Bringing Me Down
 
If Goldilocks and the Three Bears was a science story, it'd be worried about getting ""just the right amount"" of gravity.
 
If gravity was a bit stronger after the Big Bang, the universe might have imploded on itself. If it was a bit weaker, elements may not have been stable and the universe would have been one big void of scattered debris.
 
We can't complain too much about gravity --- it's perfect for us.
 
Thanks to gravity, drifting space debris aggregated to form stars, planets, galaxies, solar systems, and...us.
 
Right now, the universe is just the way we like it. But that doesn't mean it will stay this way. Scientists call this the Goldilocks Principle. If gravity weakens or strengthens, things can turn bad for us. This probably won't happen in our lifetime (or ever), but it's interesting to think about.
 
## You're Made of Stars
 
You and I are both made of atoms. As the famous astronomer Carl Sagan stated back in the early 80s:
 
> *""We are a way for the universe to know itself. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from. We long to return. And we can, because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of star-stuff."" *-- Carl Sagan
 
Breaking down his statement, we are made up of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, as well as all other heavy elements that were created in the previous generation of stars over 4.5 billion years ago.
 
When someone asks you who your ancestors are, don't forget to name a few stars along with your grandparents.
 
## Our Beautiful and Treacherous Earth
 
> *""The history of any one part of the Earth, like the life of a soldier, consists of long periods of boredom and short periods of terror."" -- British geologist Derek V. Ager.*
 
The center of the Earth is a solid core made of iron and nickel that reaches nearly 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Surrounding that is an outer core made of liquid iron and nickel.
 
The widest section of the Earth is the mantle, which is made of a semi-molten rock called magma. Finally, we come to where we live, the crust, which varies between 0 and 40 miles deep.
 
Our crust is made up of eight to twelve big plates or twenty or so smaller ones that all move in different directions and at different speeds.
 
Eventually, California (where I live) will break off of the United States and become Madagascar-esque in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Europe and North America are parting at about the speed a fingernail grows.
 
## The Mighty Cloud
 
Growing up, my dad would take me backcountry camping in Yosemite. Since we didn't have cell phones back then, we spent most of our free time staring at the clouds.
 
Do you remember looking up at the clouds and seeing dragons and boats instead of white blogs? Our imaginations are powerful things when they are left to their own devices.
 
In the first International Cloud Atlas, produced in 1896, they divided clouds into ten basic types based on their unique features. The most cushiony-looking one was number nine, cumulonimbus. Now you know why people say ""to be on cloud nine""...it was the comfy one!
 
Clouds are made from evaporated water. When water molecules accumulate and get heavy they form droplets and fall back to earth. About 60% of water molecules in a rainfall are returned back to the atmosphere within a day or two. Once evaporated, they spend no more than a week or so before falling back to Earth as rain.
 
When certain conditions manifest, these clouds can produce thunderstorms. At any one moment, there are around 1,800 thunderstorms in progress. That equates to around 40,000 per day. That means day and night there are hundreds of lightning strikes hitting the ground every second.
 
## The Road to Us
 
> *""Descended from the apes! My dear, let us hope that it is not sure, but if it is, let us pray that it will not become generally known. -- Remark attributed to the wife of the Bishop of Worcester after Darwin's theory of evolution was explained to her.*
 
We are descendants of apes, who are in turn descendants of simpler life forms. According to Darwin's Theory of Evolution, an organism's beneficial mutations are preserved because they aid survival --- this is called ""natural selection."" These beneficial mutations are then passed on to future generations and over time accumulate and result in an entirely different organism.
 
**That means 99.99% of all species that have ever lived are no longer with us.** Thousands of years from now, future organisms might look at us as we look at apes today. Of course, this assumes we don't kill ourselves or the planet before we even get to the future.
 
We also share a majority of our DNA with other species. Over 60% of human genes are fundamentally the same as those found in fruit flies and at least 90% correlate at some level to those found in mice.
 
**We need to start viewing all plants, animals, and fungi as ourselves and have the cognitive wherewithal that we live in a complex system that needs to be treated with respect if we want to keep it hospitable for all.**

6r085j,I hate the fact the highschool/college has ruined pleasure reading for me,"When I was a kid I used to read every night before bed, usually way above my reading level. It was the only way i could get to sleep. I used to blow through books like it was my job, and I enjoyed it. I was the only person in my friend group who was a ""reader"" too, and that was something I was proud of. Then high school came along and, as you all are well aware, I was forced to read books for the curriculum. Some of the books I enjoyed, like Brave New World and Macbeth, the latter of which I mainly enjoyed due to breaking the story down in class. But for everyone book I did like, there were two that I did not, and of course, I had to read it anyway unless I wanted to flunk out. My pleasure reading grinded to a halt around the end of freshman year, and even now, two years after graduation, I still struggle to finish a book. I can't really explain it, maybe I lose interest quicker or just the overall experience of reading was tainted. I don't mean to sound dramatic, but it really does bother me at times. Like why is it that, of all things, SCHOOL is the one that robbed me of the love of books, I think that's a real problem. Maybe with the way American school systems are set up now, or maybe I've just gotten lazy. 

I finished American Psycho last week, the first book I've read all the way through since high school and loved it, and am re-reading Stephen Kings ""IT"" before the new movie comes out, but man, I'm struggling to get through it, and this is a book I knocked out in a week when I was 14.

l0w831,"I can't stop re-reading sentences over and over, and it's starting to really infuriate me","I'm writing this in the hope of seeing others who can relate, and who may have found a solution.

When I was a kid, I was speeding through books. I remember reading the entirety of Harry Potter in two weeks, and every time I went on a holiday, I'd have to bring three books with me at least. Then, I had a couple of years where I didn't read much, instead having taken a bigger interest in gaming. At around the age of 16 I returned to reading - initially starting off fine - but then the compulsions began.

I have no idea how or why this started. But for the past couple of years, and now at the age of 20, I just can't stop re-reading every sentence in the book several times before feeling like I can move on - and even then I have to force myself. I've googled it and seen it can be a symptom of OCD, but I have no other symptoms that would suggest the condition.

It's hard to explain exactly how it feels. I'll read a sentence, and even if I understand it intuitively at first, I'll have an intense anxiety of not having *fully* understood it, or a fear of forgetting what I read later on because it may be important. I'll start consciously thinking of what the sentence *means*, and therefore read it again, which just makes it worse by breaking the flow. In fact, the more I read it over again, the *less* I actually understand it, and I get trapped (sort of when you stare at a single word long enough, it looks like gibberish). When I'm at a really exciting part of a book, and I have been reading for an hour or more before then to ""warm up"", I do read faster and skip most of my re-reads - because I am fully immersed and can't wait to see what happens next. But still, as soon as I finish that bit, when I pick it up again I'll feel like rereading that chapter because I didn't do my compulsions initially.

This has seriously affected my reading speed. In two hours of reading, I'll only get through 10-15 pages - and I don't even have time to read every day in the first place. I'm currently reading Stormlight Archive for the first time (and loving it) but I started Way of Kings back in June, and only finished Words of Radiance at the start of this month (now reading through Edgedancer). While the positive side is that I can drag this amazing series out and really think about it and savor it, I get super frustrated at not being able to get through it faster. I wanna know what happens next! Besides, the mental energy I spend re-reading stuff is taxing and gives me a headache. It's even starting to bleed through to stuff I read on the internet and Reddit and anywhere else, at least when it's something I care about understanding.

Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to rant. I hope someone can understand. (Note for anyone who may reply, I'm going to bed soon and probably won't be able to reply until tomorrow)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l0w831/i_cant_stop_rereading_sentences_over_and_over_and/,2021-01-19T23:29:38Z,75,224,books,Me Before You,POST
wbhi6n,Help me appreciate The Idiot by Dostoevsky (and other books like it),"I’m about 30% through and I just don’t get it. There are definitely some absolutely beautiful parts; the first one that comes to mind is the discussion about what a person thinks before being executed. They talked about how absolute a persons future is when imprisoned by the government and on death row, as opposed to other situations such as being injured in the wild (or something like that? Can’t quite remember) where you’re still able to maintain hope, no matter how dire your situation is. This part of the book gave me chills. 

But overall, the main thing I notice is: it’s a whole lot of conversation written in a way that doesn’t feel like real conversation. People talk for way too long, saying odd things. I can’t articulate it very well; it’s just that the conversation doesn’t seem “natural”. Is this just because of the difference in time? People just don’t seem to act like people. 

And these conversations go on and on and on and on, with no real point it seems half the time. 

One really weird spot was right before part 2. You have this incredibly long buildup to the craziness that is Nastasya Fillipovna, and her running circles around all the suitors, then she runs off with Rogozhin, the Prince chases after her, and it feels like it’s getting exciting and THEN!!!! 

Nothing. Skip to a few weeks later where nothing of interest came of all that tension and buildup. If that sort of thing happened in any book published today, it would be a good example of why that books writing sucks. 

Another small but annoying thing is when certain actions by characters aren’t explicitly stated. In any other book, it would say “and then bob cracked the door and stuck his head in”. But in this book, it’s more like the action of bob appearing in the scene is mentioned after he has already started speaking, or after someone is already talking to him. I just find this weird.

117gcak,Enjoyers of The Island of the Day Before- or Umberto Eco generally- tell me: what am I missing?,"Strange post, I know. But I really was looking forward to reading the Island of the Day Before. I know Eco has a penchant for philosophical fiction, which I really enjoy when it's done with humility. I also love twisting and encyclopaedic novels: the Dictionary of Khazar is amazing, the Books of Jacob fights with House of Leaves for my favourite novel ever, which are mammoth in different ways.

Admittedly, >!I haven't yet witnessed the identification of the Intruder!<\- I'm just about 100 pages in. There were ideas that I liked to immerse myself in: being marooned twice, first in the ocean, then in the sunlight that surrounds the ship; exploring the ghost and what part Roberto plays in its creation; and at times his writing is beautiful. However. It seems to me that he has no soul. He has become lost in ideas that seem interesting, and forgotten to make them mean something. I am aware that I am not far into the novel and what things mean becomes incredibly clear when you begin to take on the way of the novel, but Roberto's memories are described so dispassionately I wonder what the purpose of the foray into memory is at all. Nothing has yet begun to link together, and in everything else I recently read I begin to see things immediately. And yet I know that I'm missing something here, as you can find meaning in anything if you understand it well enough. I got so frustrated with Eco's writing yesterday I had to put it down, with how scathingly he writes the priest that confesses Roberto and with the clear veneration that he creates the Parisian that Roberto looks up to: what is the point in putting philosophy in a book if their character doesn't reflect their ideals?

I don't like the idea that I can see Umberto Eco the man writing this: infatuated with his ideas, convinced of their correctness, perhaps even arrogant having no sense of humility: and without humility, you write like this, where every monologue has the weight of a feather.

To re-emphasize, I know I'm missing something about this. But I have *never* felt this way for a book before, and it's got me in turmoil.

""*At first—even long before—he had been occupied with one question: why almost all crimes are so easily detected and solved, and why almost all criminals leave such an obviously marked trail. He came gradually to various and curious conclusions, the chief reason lying, in his opinion, not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime as in the criminal himself; the criminal himself, almost any criminal, experiences at the moment of the crime a sort of failure of will and reason, which, on the contrary, are replaced by a phenomenal, childish thoughtlessness, just at the moment when reason and prudence are most necessary. According to his conviction, it turned out that this darkening of reason and failure of will take hold of a man like a disease, develop gradually, and reach their height shortly before the crime is committed; they continue unabated during the moment of the crime itself and for some time after it, depending on the individual; then they pass in the same way as any disease passes. But the question whether the disease generates the crime, or the crime somehow by its peculiar nature is always accompanied by something akin to disease, he did not yet feel able to resolve.*""",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/t42iib/please_help_me_to_understand_a_passage_from_crime/,2022-03-01T07:40:02Z,17,41,books,Me Before You,POST

120q67k,"Stephen King's Dark Tower series gave me lucid dreams. Has anyone else ever encountered this, or any other weird side effects of reading good (or bad) books?","I distinctly remember my first lucid dream (long before I read any Stephen King). I was in second or third grade, playing in my living room, when I looked up, and there was a leg from an AT - AT Walker (those big four legged Imperial walkers from the Hoth scene in Empire Strikes Back) just standing there in my living room. I remember thinking waaaait a minute… That doesn’t go there. I’m dreaming! and I immediately did what all 8 year old boys do when they realize they’re dreaming. I ran through our third floor apartment (in slow motion for some reason, like I was running underwater), out the back door, and jumped off the porch. But, of course, instead of flying, I fell like a stone and startled myself awake. 

From then on I can recall having the occasional lucid dream, maybe once or twice a year. I typically tried to fly or kiss girls and I don’t think I ever succeeded at either, and I pretty much always woke myself up. 

Fast forward to my mid 20’s. I started reading The Dark Tower a few months before the final book came out, so I would be ready when it did. At some point while reading the series (I believe I was into the second or third book) I had a lucid dream. Not strange, as I said. Then a few days later, I had another. Then another. Then more and more. By the time I finished book 7 I was having lucid dreams almost every night. Probably five nights a week. 

I got good at it. 

I had a sort of breakthrough dream where I’m alone in an old shack with light coming through the cracks between the boards and an old roommate of mine appears like some sort of stoner dream guru and says “you know you’re dreaming, right?” and I say yes, and he proceeds to tell me I can do anything I want, and I explode the shack with my mind. We’re in the wilderness and I raise my hands and I make a city around me. Megalithic skyscrapers blast out of the ground and I fly straight up like a bullet and I drag my hand along one of the buildings and the concrete feels like pouring sand through my fingers and shatters at my touch, and I spiral and dive and my stomach doesn’t drop and I can do literally anything I can think of. I build and destroy and I am capital G God in that world and it all feels perfectly real, and I don’t wake myself up until I’m good and ready. 

Not all the dreams were like that, but you get the idea. 

When I finished the series, the dreams continued for a time with decreasing frequency, and these days I’m back to my old once or twice per year pattern. I’ve read plenty of good fiction since then, including fantasy and sci-fi, but the dreams have never returned. I have not reread the Dark Tower.

Anyone else experienced anything like this, or any other odd side effects of reading books?

Just curious.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/120q67k/stephen_kings_dark_tower_series_gave_me_lucid/,2023-03-24T16:52:27Z,23,15,books,Me Before You,POST

2ig87f,I've lost my reading bug and that scares me.,"tl;dr - I used to read a lot, now I don't. Is there a way to get interested in books again?

I guess the title pretty much says it all. I have always been an avid reader, but my reading has had hot and heavy periods and long lulls where i didnt read. Early in 2013, I discovered Goodreads and got a Kindle and smartphone shortly thereafter. Between the convenience of a Kindle, the organization of Goodreads, and the bathroom reading sessions at work on my phone, I have been tearing up books since last year. Then I read Promise of Blood a few months ago and then, that was pretty much it. I guess the big change is that I switched jobs. I used to read every lunch break, but now I have the internet so I end up watching anime. I used to read before bed too, but that seems to have tapered off too. I don't know what the deal is. Maybe it is just one of those lulls that I have had before. My fear is that my reading bug is gone forever, which makes me sick to think about since I have so many books I want to read. Reading these last couple years has been almost a compulsion, I HAD to READ! Now its just like, meh. Has anyone experienced this before? What was your experience, and did that meh feeling go away? 

EDIT 1: I appreciate everyone's suggestions. I think the best course of action for me is to try a different genre for awhile I have been wanting to read Unbroken for awhile so I may try that. Also, some of the Mary Roach books (FEaB) sound really interesting so that may be a good way to try something else as well as some of the Cormac McCarthy books.  Either something new or I just need to not stress about it and get  back into it when I ""feel it"" again.  I do listen to audio books as well, but I tend to do so very slow cos I follow a number of podcasts as well that I listen to while commuting to work and out walking.

Someone had commented and asked what kind of stuff I like.  I don't think I need any book recommendations at the moment, thank you though.  I am a big fantasy/sci-fi reader so I follow most of the big names and probably dont need MORE titles to add to my list and make my anxiety grow.  

Once again, thanks for the suggestions.  Now I just need to learn to CHILLLLLLLLLLLLL.

100q0h,"I'm 23 years old and a tech addict. Please, /r/Books, reintroduce me to the world of reading.","Well, hello there.

As stated in the title, I could use a little help over here :)
I am a 23 year old male from Germany and I have to make a confession. 
For most of my life, I could not bring myself to read a book, asides from the ones I had to read for school.
Of course, there were always exceptions, like a few thrillers / crime novels by Stephen King, Simon Beckett and other authors.
But in the past 3 years or so, I stopped completely, mainly because I got out of school, and with it disappeared the need to read a good story once in a while. 
On the other hand, I am sort of addicted to everything that has a screen. I am a more than casual gamer (since I was a kid I always had a pc/c64 and a console ready to be played with), love watching movies (big plasma) and all sorts of tv series (sometimes even parallel to gaming on my second screen), not to mention my youtube consumption. The time I spend surfing online I also own a smartphone (no surprise here) and here comes the irony: 
A Kindle. Yep. I got the third gen when it came out in the UK (I even got it shipped, so I was one of the few lucky guys to have one right after release and one year before most people here) and it nicely sits on my cupboard, waiting to be used.
All this flashy media always available, made me really reluctant to grab a simple book. That's why I got the Kindle in the first Place, did not really help neither..
What I started to realize recently is that my imagination, creativity, my ability to concentrate on a simple text, all slowly fade away. 
I am feeling a constant impulse to distract myself from something the second it gets a little boring. I guess, I did a good job fucking up my brain with all this simultanious entertainment (two pc screens, tv and smartphone).
I miss the feeling of really being immersed in my imagination, having to create images in my mind, enjoying that epicness of fnishing a book, ... 
So I wrote down a few questions for you guys, to start the conversation, but feel free to comment on anything I said, or to ask me stuff (I know you do whatever you want to anyway so :P ).

- First things first: Should I use my Kindle to buy ebooks or buy the real stuff? What's more likely to get me fixed again? I always wanted to start a collection, but thought it would be to expensive (I have read 10 free classics on my Kindle, while buying the rest from Amazon). Now, I like the thought of having a real physical collection consisting of those books, I will hopefully be devouring soon with your assistence. 

- Given the circumstance, that I should decide to buy physical copies, where is the best place to buy those? I mean, I could afford to buy one or two fresh copies a month. How do you feel about second hand shops for books? My main problem is, I like to read books in English, unless originally written in German.

- How do I not stop in the middle of a book? Often, it is not even because I did not enjoy reading it. There is just something that takes my attention away from a story for a little to long (let's say a videogame, for like 3-4 evenings) and cannot get back in the mood of continuing it. This happened to me so many times before...

- What's the best place to start? Imagine my brain as a blank page, and you have the chance to write on it by recommending those books you appreciate the most. Of course, tastes differ and mine is still to be determined regarding books, but isn't that a beautiful thing? 
I already checked part of the top 200 sticky and found the really nice post by macguffing. Both overwhelmed me. Not just because of the huge number of titles, but also because I have no idea where to start my journey. As genres, I am thinking of SF, Fantasy or detective story / thriller. As of Author or even specific book, I am completely lost.

- And last, but not least: Do you know techniques to improve my concentration? How can I keep myself from using all this tech all the time? I really do not want to be that junkie who can't live without the internet, but I am scared I already am. There are so many people who told me that reading is the perfect balancing in their tech ridden lifes.

Thanks for reading, and as I said before, feel free to write down everything that crossed your mind in the last few minutes reading this.

tl;dr: addicted to ""fastfoodentertainment"", wants to start reading books again, needs you to help answer his questions and give ideas

Edit: Wow, I just went online to check out if anyone already answered before going to sleep, and I am overwhelmed. Sorry, I could not answer yet, but I will definitely do my best to comment on everything during the daytime tomorrow. Anyway thanks so much to all of you. Writing this very quick on my S2 in bed this moment (pretty excited because it is my first real experience as OP on reddit :D )

Edit2: Just wanted to thank you all again for beeing so incredibly helpful. 
Now, I did not only find motivation to read again, but have a diversified list of over 50 brilliant looking books. Hopefully I will find one or two stores in the near future, so I can get the feeling of a great book deal again, otherwise I will stick to Amazon or Ebay. Additionally, my new bookmarks for free books should help me fill in some time in between.

3ohhkw,Is it me or has ebook pricing gotten ridiculous?,"I'm just looking at some new books, and it seems Amazon struck a deal with many publishers that now allows publishers to set the price for their Kindle books. Now just about every new Kindle book is going for the same price as the hardcover version of the book, minus anywhere from a dollar to a dime.

I have really enjoyed getting books on Amazon because the ebooks were in line with paperback prices generally, which is fine, since there's no physical material involved and you don't generally display them like a hardcover title.

Now I'm a bit upset by this change. I don't feel like I'm getting value in the current price model. With as fast as I read, I can burn through a $15 book in less than four hours, I'm not okay with this. It's going to make keeping up with reading my favorite authors on average 50% or more costly than before. In the past the average book I read ranged from $6.99 to $9.99, now I don't see a single book I'm interested in for under $14.99.

giuf5j,I can't get over Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go," I know this has been discussed here before, but after being emotionally floored I just had to post about it again.

Quietly moving and davastatingly heart-wrenching. No matter your reading preferences or favourite genres, this is an absolute must-read.

Some disjointed thougths (and spoilers) ahead.

Firstly, I found the unrealiable narrator extremely compelling - it was clear early on that she was interpreting things in her own way, with the detatched way she reacts to very emotional events contrasted with the excessive focus on small details and social cues which might have seemed trivial on the surface. It effectively humanised her (which was an essential task given the eventual reveal) and fleshed out her character in an understated way. And that's the best way to describe this book - understated.

In dealing with such heavy subject matter and complex themes, the story remains grounded around the development and ordeals of our three protagonists, with the dystopian elements acting more as a framing device to the universal emotions being explored. There are very few explosive outbursts but rather every new discovery is cautiously considered and ultimately dealt with quiet, resigned acceptance. And this made it all that much more hard-hitting.

That said, the book keeps you engrossed with the agonisingly slow trickle of world-building and the way that the actual workings of the whole cloning/donation system are only vaguely hinted at and never outright explained. You're left questioning ""Why do the donors simply perform their role and not rebel or run away?"" ""How can this ever be ethically justified by society?"" But then there are many historical (and contemporary) parallels which show that this is more realistic than we'd like to believe.

On a side-note, I couldn't help but draw thematic comparisons to another book named after a song; Murakami's Norwegian Wood. The sense of childhood nostalgia, complicated friendships intertwining with mistimed and unfulfilled love, and the general powerlessness of the protagonists to societal forces which reinforce their feeling of otherness and disconnection.

Last April, I released a novel, [The End of October](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/624363/the-end-of-october-by-lawrence-wright/), in which I gave a fictionalized account of a devastating disease sweeping across the globe. The manuscript was completed and delivered before COVID-19 hit the scene. Then, at the end of last year, I penned an article for The New Yorker about the actual pandemic we were facing, entitled ""[The Plague Year](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/04/the-plague-year)"". Now, as of last week, my book of the same title is out in the world.
 
In [The Plague Year](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/678999/the-plague-year-by-lawrence-wright/), I look at 2020 from the initial outbreak of COVID-19 to the storming of the U.S. Capitol to the extraordinary vaccine rollout, touching on medical, economic, political, and social ramifications of the pandemic.

112zihi,"I just read the Andromeda strain and I couldn't put it down - first book in a long time I've read all in one day. I also can't believe how much a book about a killer space virus made me think - such a unique combination of thriller style / story with big, interesting scientific ideas!","I'm left feeling like Michael Crichton is the literary equivalent of Steven Spielberg. Roughly the same time period, and they both made hugely popular creative works with mass market appeal that also have some real depth. If you haven't read any Crichton, do yourself a favor and pick some up!

**Here's the setup** of Andromeda Strain (no spoilers, but putting in tags just in case you like to go in totally blank slate):

>!A US government program is sending satellites with scoops into orbit, looking for alien organisms that can survive the void of space. When one of the scoops comes down in the Arizona desert two soldiers are sent out to pick it up. But as they get closer, they realize the signal has moved - someone has already picked up the object and moved it into the tiny town of Piedmont. As the two men pull into town, bodies line the streets. In less than five minutes they are dead too.  !<

>!The government is forced to mobilize Project Wildfire, a top-secret emergency response protocol. Four of the nation’s most elite biophysicists are summoned to a clandestine underground laboratory where they must race to understand and contain the crisis. But the Andromeda Strain proves different from anything they’ve ever seen - and what they don’t know could not only hurt them, but lead to unprecedented worldwide catastrophe.!<

**And what makes it great (and what held it back)**:

The central idea is unbelievably propulsive and the beginning of the novel is unforgettable. Unfortunately it slows a bit as the book goes on and the ending isn’t very satisfying - but I still couldn’t put the book down and read the whole thing in one day.

The most unique thing about the book is the narrative style - its framed as a top secret document detailing real events, and that very much helps make it feel real, engrossing, and a little transgressive that we get to read it. 

One watch out about that narrative style - the book includes a number of pages of maps, printouts from military computers, comms transcripts, and pages of top-secret documents which are really not meant to be read line by line, but add to the realistic feeling. But on audiobook they read all those words out verbatim and its pretty brutal - so this is a better book to read in print than audio.

The core concept is based on a proposed answer to the Fermi-Paradox.  Essentially if we are going to encounter extraterrestrial life, it is far more likely we encounter single-cell or viral organisms first before complex life just because it is much more likely to evolve and develop. That's just one of a wide number of interesting scientific ideas and theories that are raised throughout the book. As a testament to how real the science felt, there is a bibliography at the end - and I felt like I needed to check if the work he’s citing is real. Its not, but could have fooled me!

Definitely my favorite Crichton novel - check it out if you haven't read it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/112zihi/i_just_read_the_andromeda_strain_and_i_couldnt/,2023-02-15T14:39:35Z,60,181,books,Me Before You,POST
10d3ba0,Finished “Never Let Me Go” today and I just need to talk about it…,"First off, I enjoyed this book quite a lot. It didn’t leave me crying, but it certainly did left me feeling sad afterwards. Especially those final pages where Kathy starts talking about Norfolk and imagines… well, that really hurt me to my core. 

The writing itself went on a lot of tangents that went seemingly nowhere, but I believe that is what makes this book so realistic. Knowing that this book is entirely from the perspective of Kathy, who is remembering everything that has led her to where she is now, it’s not only understandable why it’s like that but also adds a sense of nostalgia that really just evaluates the book for me.

Speaking of realistic, Ruth has got to be one of the most realistic characters I’ve ever read. This makes her my favorite character from this book, which I know will probably get some eyebrows raised but hear me out. She’s someone that at moments you love and at others you hate like how everyone is. She’s someone that when you understand why they did the things they did, you sympathize with them a bit because they’re things that we too somewhat want in life. All of her traits are something that anyone can relate to at some level.

Now I’ll like to discuss the “twist” at the end, and why I think it isn’t suppose to be one at all. As we all probably guessed halfway through, the students are clones who are raised to have their organs harvested or as they call it “donated.” This isn’t a twist not just because of all the information we’re clearly given throughout the book, but that the students and we have also known. Not fully understood, but knew. I believe when Kathy mentions about Miss Lucy’s lectures about being “told and not told,” she mentions that all of them have known that they’ll do donations but never really acknowledged it. This I believes shows that at some level they always understood their reason for existing, which just makes it even sadder. It also brings reasoning towards their reaction to the truth simply being to continue how they were before. 

I’ll like to hear what y’all have to say about this book too. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10d3ba0/finished_never_let_me_go_today_and_i_just_need_to/,2023-01-16T03:04:50Z,14,21,books,Me Before You,POST

xr5wr6,"Heavy Set by Ray Bradbury has an interesting ""read between the lines"" story style that appeals to me.","SPOILERS FOR HEAVY SET


I read this story as part of a celebration of Halloween collection called October Dreams. Its about a thirty year old man who's probably either mentally or socially challenged. He lives with his mom by the ocean and spends almost every waking moment lifting weights or similar activities, and is heavily muscled, almost maniacally energetic. His mom loves him very much and worries about him when he's not home. The story deals with him going to a Halloween party and his moms anxiousness about him while he's gone.

The interesting thing about this story is not what is shown going on, but what isn't. Nothing overtly bad happens at all. There's no violence or harm done to anyone or anything other than a story about a mother worried about her challenged son. He seems nice, if somewhat distracted and sullen. He's good looking, and young women will call him up to ask him to go to the beach, or on a date. But when you read between the lines and start to pick up hints strewn along the way this story gets a lot more sinister.

Heavy Set (the man/childs nickname because of his huge size) gives off an aura of barely contained violence. Throughout the story he's constantly using his prodigious strength and energy as an outlet for frustrated feelings. At one point he's outside shooting baskets until two in the morning, or squeezing his hand weights for hours on end.

Coming home from a Halloween party which didn't live up to his expectations shows him frustrated and angry, in a withdrawn and sullen way. His mom knows him well enough to stay out of his way and let him cool down, hopefully. She goes to bed, but later that night feels his weight lying next to her, silent, still, dangerous. He's just lying there squeezing his hand weights over and over again. Next to him his mom is awake now, fearful of her son. She prays that he keeps squeezing those hand weights, crushing his frustrations out, because if he didn't have those weights what might he decide to crush instead?

Like I mentioned before I thought it's was a good story that implied a lot more than what was shown.

m252eb,I wrote Dean Koontz a letter years ago and he sent me a four page response. Here it is. (Mild spoilers for some of his older works),"Background: I wrote Dean Koontz a letter asking why some of his characters are fully evil with no redeeming qualities. I explained that some of my acting coaches discouraged us from playing villains that had no redeeming qualities, and he decided to respond with this. I will add that I now disagree with quite a bit of what he said to me, but his response and reasons for his beliefs still fascinate me greatly.

Dear [op], 
Thanks for your good letter. In fact, out of the 250 from readers this week, it struck me as the most interesting—even though my readers are a lively and articulate bunch—which is why this long response. 
Classes teaching that no character can be pure evil are classes being taught from one of two philosophical positions. (1) the Freudian view that everyone is a victim of someone—his family, religion, culture, class system, government—and therefore his nature is formed by others and his actions are a consequence of repression or oppression. In this world view, even the most heinous individual can be healed to one degree or another by therapy, by transgressive rejection of moral codes, and by the right actions of an enlightened elite. Freudian theory has never been shown to have a scintilla of truth to it, and in fact virtually his entire life’s work has been discredited. He was a bizarre man in many ways, but in spite of his personal lack of ethics and the fact that his theories are constructed so that they can neither be proved nor disproved (the sure sign of a charlatan), our entire culture and law still stands on the rotting foundation of Freudianism. (2) Moral relativism and cultural equality. The idea that right and wrong change according to time and place, according to culture and tradition, that there is no universal tao; therefore, that no act and no person can be entirely good or entirely evil, but is always to be perceived in shades of gray. A great many people believe this with such passion that it is a kind of religious tenet to them, and they will argue to exhaustion that no culture’s code of conduct is superior to another. If you suggest that the culture of the United States in the first half of the 20th century was immeasurably more admirable and healthier than the culture of the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich to which it had led, or if you argue that even for all its colonial ambitions, 16th-century Spain’s culture was more compassionate and more just than that of the Aztecs that Cortes conquered, the Aztecs with all their human sacrifices and slavery and mutilation of women, the true believer will either accuse you of not knowing history and then walk away (because he does not know history), or will smile knowingly and lie so aggressively about history that adult discussion is impossible. 

The Freudians and the moral relativists have much in common, and two things they share is a desire to excuse evil with a lower-case e as part of a justification for living themselves without any significant rules of ethics or honor, and to transgressively deny the existence of Evil with a capital E. Consequently, they have to avoid truth more than embrace it, and one of the truths they have to pretend does not exist is the sociopathic mind. 

Depending on which psychologist’s work you respect, the percentage of any populace that is sociopathic ranges between 2% and 10%. The sociopath has no human emotions as we know them, but he fakes them so extraordinarily well that he can even be charming. He or she has no capacity for empathy. He can kill the most innocent among us with zero remorse. He is nihilistic and narcissistic to the extreme. 

Is the sociopath born that way, or does nurture (or lack of it) play a role? My own suspicion is that sociopathy is not a genetic condition, that at best there may be a genetic predisposition to sociopathy in some people, but that sociopathy is a consequence of narcissism so long and so assiduously indulged that it darkens into sociopathic nihilism and an almost solipsistic view of other people—i.e. that they are not real, but are merely toys for the sociopath’s use. 

But I find it equally hard to believe that sociopaths are formed by anything but their own choices. They exist across all class and racial divisions; neither poverty nor lack of education prevents sociopaths from forming, and neither does wealth nor the highest degree of education. Many of history’s greatest intellectuals have arguably been sociopathic. Rousseau, an appalling man, said that the only one he ever loved was Sophie d’Houdetot. But after his death, she said that he had been “ugly enough to frighten me . . . he was an interesting madman.” By “ugly” she did not mean physically unattractive. If you know how Sartre, Ibsen, Marx, Hemingway and others treated people in their private lives—monstrously and with a tendency to deceive that makes them vulnerable to the charge that they were pathological liars—you see that sociopathy can coexist with genius, but genius does not to any degree ameliorate the evil. 

Some serial killers—all of whom are sociopaths, though not ever sociopath becomes a killer—exhibit cruelty and an incapacity for genuine remorse as young as 5 and 6, when they torture insects and small animals. You might argue that such a tender age is too young to have chosen narcissism, that first step toward sociopathy. But I’m not so sure. Other serial killers show signs of cruelty and narcissism around the time of puberty, which is certainly old enough for the choice of narcissism to be made, and others as late as 17 and 18. 
There is no recorded case of a diagnosed sociopath being cured or to any degree reformed. Once a person has purged from himself or herself all respect for others, all respect for life, and any sense of limits to selfish behavior, there is no going back. To pretend that sociopaths don’t exist is equivalent to pretending that the earth is flat. In dealing with a sociopathic character—how could a writer or an actor portray him as anything more than pure evil? I have friends who are cops and I’ve known quite a few others casually; nothing strikes them as amusing as the contention that every criminal can be rehabilitated (some can, not all) or that even the most hardened killer has some good qualities (some do, some don’t). They live it daily, and they have no trouble believing in pure evil. 

When I write about a total transgressive, a sociopath, I often make him entertaining by making him funny. Such as Junior in FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE or Corky in THE FACE. But they never realize that they’re funny, so they are not redeemed by their humor. They’re unintentionally hilarious. A transgressive life—the total embrace of narcissism, nihilism—is in essence the life of a fool revolting against reality, and it will inevitably be darkly funny. 

Late in life, my father was diagnosed to be sociopathic. Growing up under the thumb of such a one, I had plenty of time to think about the subject when I wasn’t worrying about survival. By the time I was in my twenties, I had largely concluded that sociopathy is a condition arrived at by choice. 
I have come to think that sociopathy is more widely spread than anyone realizes. At a guess, I’d say that 20% of humanity has chosen sociopathy and acts upon it to one degree or another. The most cunning ones can do anything they want—becmoe President, even—without the average citizen being aware of the depth of their depravity and their capacity for cruelty. They are consummate performers; no sane actor—sorry to say—can match their thespian skills. I’ve got a good eye for them, and even my wife, who knew my father well, will sometimes see a new face on the national scene and, before I can express my own sense of his or her sociopathy, Gerda will call him out for me. If you look at sociopathic Germany, about 20% of the citizenry participated in horrific crimes without remorse. Under Pol Pot in Cambodia, the percentage might have been higher, and certainly under Stalin and Mao. 

My own father was diagnosed as sociopathic late in life, and I know too well what being under the thumb of such a person is like. I’ve no illusion that evil can’t be pure or that we are all victims. It is a choice, and once the evil choice has been made often enough for a long time, it becomes the only choice that individual can make. My father, for instance, would always tell a lie even when he knew that you knew he was lying and even when the truth would have better served him. 

Here’s the thing that fascinates me about this. As I said, poverty and lack of education are associated no more with sociopaths than with good citizens. Class, race, gender, a family’s genetic history: no condition predisposes a person to the path of narcissism, nihilism, and ultimately sociopathy. No condition except one—being raised without any regular exposure to faith-based moral codes. This doesn’t mean the family has to have been churchgoers to inoculate against sociopathy, only that they have to have believed in one faith or another and, though not practicing it, nevertheless respected it in the instruction they gave their children. Something like 98% of all diagnosted sociopaths came from homes in which the concept of God did not exist. When you look at the sociopathic regimes of the past century—Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot, Lenin, all the horrible little dictators of eastern Europe—they are atheistic. People sometimes say, “oh, but wasn’t Hitler Christian?” This used to surprise me, but ignorance of history is so widespread that nothing surprises me anymore. Hitler hated Christians only second to Jews because, as the brilliant culture theorist, Philip Rieff put it, the “Jews represented what they were not—the God that must be murdered” (the first monotheistic God) if the moral codes of a society and the laws based on those codes were to be overthrown and a new system installed. 

And so, [op], this is why I write about certain evil people, I feel not only justified but also obliged to present their evil as pure and to suggest, by doing so, that Evil walks the world, Evil that mocks therapy and delights in the moral relativism that gives it cover. Ryan in YOUR HEART BELONGS TO ME isn’t the only one of my antagonists who is not hopelessly sociopathic, and like all of my protagonists, he has his flaws—an extreme flaw in this case. But my life experience does lead me, more often than not, to write about those villains who have made themselves into evil unrelieved by any mercy.

pmwql4,I finished reading ‘Never Let Me Go’ and need to vent,"So I’ve searched the book title in this sub and read some but not all of the thread about this book. Mostly the threads discuss about the overall story in the book, >!organ harvesting and the morality of it all.!<

But I haven’t seen anyone mad enough at what Ruth did. When Ruth admitted to >!keeping Tommy and Kathy apart,!< the bullshit she had been spewing to hurt Kathy’s feeling made so much more sense. I thought she was just being bitchy for the sake of being bitchy bc she knew in her heart of hearts that >!Tommy should’ve been with Kathy all along.!<

Plus she’s the kind of girl who has to be the centre of attention wherever she goes and she couldn’t stand it when other guys pay more attention to her close friend. It’s not that I was blind and her admission was not the only thing that clued me in on what she have been doing. I had an inkling all along and was just as mad every time she needled Kathy to get a reaction out of her during every single conflict they had.

I’m just mad bc >!she totally ruined the chance for Kathy and Tommy to be together for the short lifespan that they have before they complete after four donations at most. I’m mad that she was cruel enough to keep Kathy close by and make Kathy watch as she goes around parading Tommy as her boyfriend when all along she cheated on Tommy several times. I’m mad that she didn’t get to find out that there was no deferral and bc of her Kathy and Tommy got such a short while together. I’m mad that Kathy was so stuck in her friendship with Ruth that she stuck around. I just feel so badly for Kathy. Ruth doesn’t deserve half the kindness Kathy did for her, imo.!<

Sorry that this got lengthy. I just needed to vent bc no one else in my life read as much as I do and so I don’t have anyone to discuss books with.

11xffe7,Wicked Little Deeds was kinda weird to me.,"Maybe, at 22 I'm too old for it. But it was in my give away box and also, adapted its called Sady's Ghost. After reading the book, I'm not really mad about it.

First 150 pages were so boring. The book reads fast overall, but school drama in a small town called Burden Falls (which is a tad too much) was almost excruciating. But the creepy and bloody elements are quite good. I can't really call the main character angsty, mostly because she had so much loss throughout the book and just before the main plot, it's suprising how lively she is in her black clothes. 

The ending escalates a bit too quickly, too early and then drags one in a way that short chapter concept hurts it at times. The love interest is fine. The moment he uttered his planes for the future I knew he wasn't dying. Maybe, I wanted ghost to be more explored, but the twist was in the living. I didn't expected, but I also didn't really expect anything. 

The  books also gives off a major ''Pick me up for a movie!'' vibes. Regular tropes aren't really offensive hear, but the amount of reference dropping threw me off a  little bit.  It's a good enough book, but the amount of ghost name-droping didn't really make anything pop in the end.

verxh2,My Review of Finding Me : A Memoir by Viola Davis,"Oh Viola, how I love you even more. ❤️ Being my favorite actress, there was no question I had to read this. And I am so happy I did. Not only does Davis reveals the hardships of growing up Black, abused and in poverty, she digs deep into her emotions and trauma and puts it all out there for everyone. I believe she wrote this book not to just tell her story and help heal, but for her readers to gain and learn something from it as well.

Her writing was very real to me and far from sugar coated. I found it comforting how honest she is about her physical, mental and spiritual health and finding ways to cope with it through therapy and fighting her own demons. She let me see her in a way I haven’t been able to before, gaining much more respect and love for her. Sometimes, you never get to see that in celebrities. But Viola is more than a celebrity, she is a beautiful human living her beautiful, non-perfect life. Just like you and me.

18w772j,I have just finished 'Never Let Me Go' by Kazuo Ishiguro for the 2nd time and i have so many questions and thoughts I need to share. (Spoilers),"Never let me go is the best book I have ever read. I am 16 and have not read a book for years, however at school I was forced to read it a year ago and it stuck with me. In an attempt to get into books again and focus more on certain parts of the story which I did not focus on in the teacher lead reading I chose to pick up my dad’s copy of the book and read it again.     
Part of the reason that the book stuck so well with me was because Ruth, who is later portrayed as an antagonistic and manipulative person, initially (in part one) reminded me of a best online friend who disappeared about a week before I started reading it. I am scared as if a member of Gen Z who has grown up with a lot of access, and who has a short attention span thanks to short-form video content, will ever be able to enjoy and relate to a book that I do not link to a large piece of sadness over my life.  
     
1. What books like Never Let Me Go do you think I will be able to enjoy and share similar connections to? (I already intend to read Klara and the sun thanks to a comment I saw on here) 2. Do you ever connect characters in books to people you know/miss in real life and dose that help you read?     
About the book itself now (Spoilers will intensify):    
3. Was Ruth really that bad, she made a mistake and basically ruined two people’s lives - but this mistake was caused by a systematic mistreatment and a genuine impending doom? It's very easy to blame her but in the same situation and background would you develop the morals to avoid lashing out in that way?    
 4. Towards the end Madame and Ms Emily are presented as trying to help them but they both still appears to feel some genuine revulsion, if they truly believe(d) in their work, why do they retain this fear?     
I don't mind the fact that they don't escape, I don’t care that the students take this great injustice as a given in the same way we accept death. What I do mind is that Madame and Miss Emily expect thanks for trying to show morality.     
5. Do you think that Ms Lucy's idea about telling the children about their fate is correct?     
5B. Is it correct to shield people from truths even if it makes them feel emotionally better?  

  
Another point my dad raised when I had a fairly surface level decision with him about the book (frankly I feel slightly embarrassed to talk to people I actually know about my feelings towards it) said that it sort of represents (I’m not sure if it was unintentional) livestock for food, both things keep our lives at the cost of others, this is sort of hinted at in the book where they are referred to as 'poor creatures' towards the end of the book. Frankly this is making me contemplate being vegetarian.  
6. Do you think this could have been an intentional choice by the author or a mere coincidence?     


The book also shows how I feel school has failed me in terms of reading, this book proves that structure and language devices don't make a book, it is how the story dose it. I feel that GCSE English has taken away my love for reading through the stressing of memorising quotes to explain a book when basic language could be used and still invoke an emotive response for the reader. - If you are a kid doing GCSES in any year and struggle with English (or do well in it) don't let it destroy your reading like it did for me.    


One thing I noticed was that it definitely made me questions myself, there were points where they children seemed happy and I contemplated weather their lives were, until the training and onwards, better than mine and if given the option I would trade, (I know this is stupid to consider on a multitude of levels, but that is just how emotionally deep this book goes for me)    
Overall, Never Let me go has taught me a lot about myself and how I have handled sadness in my life and I would love any book recommendations of other books like it (really sad, sci-fi style dystopia). Thank you for reading this, it means a lot. I would love to have more conversations with anyone who has read the book in direct messages if it had the same or similar levels of effect on them to me.     
Thank you and have a good day.

j7z3th,The City We Became by N.K. Jemison taught me what it was like for a minority to read mainstream fiction,"I'm a big fan of Jemison, having read Inheritance and Broken Earth both as well as some of her short fiction. In both of her previous series I really appreciated the diversity that was present in the cast of her characters. 

So going in I knew she would have a lot of ethnic, gender and LGBTQ representation. What I don't think I was prepared for was to see all white characters portrayed as a stereotype! I found it so throwing. I really found the book harder to engage with, even as an experienced reader who had some expectations of how ""my"" group would likely be represented.

It's one thing to read a book without a white guy in it, that's rare of course but in SF or Fantasy not crazy.  Of course, half the books one could name without a white guy in it have a ""white guy in disguise"" as it were. What I mean by that is something like Watership Down, which is technically all about rabbits, but they speak, think and act like white males.

But with The City We Became, every time a white character was introduced I wondered what sterotype they were going to represent. Even with my openness to diverse viewpoint fiction I found it seriously off-putting to not be able to see myself represented positively in the text! It was a tiny window into what it would probably be like to go through a ""traditional"" (classic Euro-focused) English curriculum as a student of color or alternate gender identity. Never feeling like you can put yourself in the shoes of the hero, and being immediately defensive when someone who *is* like you is introduced in the text, waiting to see how they will be represented as a caricature has to be a huge barrier to accessing literature.

I'm a teacher (Science) and so I knew this intellectually and tried to work to prevent it in my lessons by highlighting the accomplishments of women and minorities in science, but The City We Became took what was an idea and gave it real context for me.

That felt a little like a ramble, so I hope that made sense.

Edit:  I also wanted to add that I know this was intentional on Jemison's part. After finishing the book and looking into it I saw that she wrote it as a response to Lovecraft and his negative stereotypical portrayal of minorities in his work. Even before I knew that was an intentional message of the book though I found the tactic incredibly effective for me to broaden my perspective as a reader.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/j7z3th/the_city_we_became_by_nk_jemison_taught_me_what/,2020-10-09T13:39:44Z,71,129,books,Me Before You,POST
w5k5b9,"Pride and Prejudice puts me in a reading slump everytime!! Help!! (english is not my first language , sorry)","I've tried reading Pride and Prejudice three times already and never got past chapter 24, I always get really unmotivated, drop it and have a really hard time picking up another book for one month or so (which is unusual for me). I've read many classics before both in english and in portuguese (my first language) and enjoyed most of them, but this is my first Jane Austen book.
I don't think I have a problem understanding the language, I just feel like nothing ever happens and I can't get attached to any of the characters, but I feel like I'm missing something because I heard a lot of praise about this book. I want to give it one more try, any tips to make it better? Something that maybe would help me see what I'm missing? Or should I just give up and maybe try a different Jane Austen book?

I'm sorry if I offended any Pride and Prejudice fans, I really appreciate her genious way with word and am trying really hard to like it :)

fy9nfm,Never Let Me Go's Matroshka doll writing,"Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro had a......complex writing style, to say the least. First he tells the overall story, then he focuses on one part of that, then he focuses on an even MORE specific part of that, before going back to the previous thread with that context in mind, and then going back to the previous story, and finally using all that context in the overall story, before moving on.

The result is, in my mind, looking like a series of  Russian dolls, that have smaller dolls inside them. It's quite complicated, to say the least. I can't say I'm a remembrance savant, but too often I forgot the previous stories just because he was digging and digging into a story and then putting it back in until I was lost.

And while I said he was focusing on a story, sometimes at the beginning of those I always feel like ""What the hell is the relation of this story to the previous, more general one?"" such that even once I reach the end and could see why it was written, the feeling of resentment from the first moment(when I was feeling like he was meandering) still remained.

What do you think? Was the writing style ok for you? For me it was needlessly complicated. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fy9nfm/never_let_me_gos_matroshka_doll_writing/,2020-04-10T05:55:17Z,13,9,books,Me Before You,POST

rz5i6j,Jaws got me back into reading.,"
I used to read a lot. When I was a kid, but pretty much stopped reading outside of school just before high school started. I would do the summer reading programs and everything. I thought I was just a guy who didn't love reading, but I was just impatient and unfocused. Towards the end of my most recent semester at college I made a spur of the moment decision to go into the library to kill time before class. It was amazing to see how much they really had. Just going through each shelf I'd find books about anything. However one book really stuck out to me. That was Jaws. As I inspected I realized it was a first edition from 1974. I just had to borrow it. And pun intended it just hooked me. I just recently finished it (a day before it was due). Just being given the privilege of being able to read a great book but an old one too, was just amazing to me. I'm so excited to continue exploring the vast collection that library has to offer. 

Edit: It took me some time to get through the book as I had little interest in some plotlines. What kept me reading was Sheriff Brody and his interactions with community. I sympathized with his struggle and got a wave of satisfaction in the end. There were moments where Peter Benchley's writing shined further engaging me in the story. However his wording can get a little strange sometimes where I had to read lines multiple times to understood. I also loved the vocabulary in this book. I learned so many words reading this book, and didn't need to google all of to understand their meaning. Overall a great book from almost half a century ago and shows why it was quickly adapted to the screen a year later.


TLDR: I was an impatient child who have up reading until I discovered my school's library.

I'd love to hear your opinions on the book if you have read it. I know I had tons to say when reading it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rz5i6j/jaws_got_me_back_into_reading/,2022-01-08T17:50:48Z,7,1,books,Me Before You,POST
18j4ahw,"Doctor For The Broken Hearted, by Ivo Pereira, is a fictitious tale about trauma that left me emotional...","I'm always on the hunt for new books and, personally, I'm always head over heels for stories that tackle gritty topics and make that their central point. Having said that, I wasn't sure about this book as I've never heard of the author and this seems to be his first book. It also didn't help that the author isn't a native english speaker, but wrote the book in english. Note that I'm not saying people who aren't native speakers shouldn't write in whatever language makes them comfortable, I'm just saying that, given how this looks like it was his first publishing, I had my doubts. For context, I share the authors nationality - we're both portuguese - and I saw this book at my local library, but if you are in any way interested in the book, I believe you can order it online, and there's obviously always the e-book format, which is a format I very much despise...

&#x200B;

Having said all that, I decided to give it a shot after skimming through a few loose pages on each chapter and I thought ""why not?"".

&#x200B;

The gist of the plot is that we follow the week of a psychologist, doctor Heart, and his interactions with the patients that he gets everyday. I will straight off the bat say that doctor Heart's schedule wasn't something that was on the author's mind, as in most days he only sees one person and then on another he sees two - mind you this is just me nitpicking, and it is just a nitpick, because the meat and potatoes isn't in the realism of schedules but the problems discussed with each person.

&#x200B;

For as much as english not being the author's native language was a doubting point for me, the grammar seems fine. The author clearly had different personalities in mind for each character and, to my untrained eye, each character does speak and act in a way that's realistic and most of all fun. Fun as in everyone has something unique to them that's believable, by the way.

&#x200B;

As it might or might not be obvious, this is a very character driven story; there is an overarching plot revolving around Heart's past and how he deals with trauma, but that is sprinkled in each chapter. As we read through each chapter, it's clear that we're starting to see much more of Heart and the story eventually shifts from Heart & Patients, to Heart. I will say that in the first chapter, Heart was a bit of a blank canvas, for me at least, as he just looked like the usual doctor-type and was there as a stand-in for the audience as we found out what was wrong with each person. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I was just pleasently surprised when finding out that Heart did have more to his character than just ""doctor gives advice to patient"".

&#x200B;

Like I mentioned, each character is unique. Mind some spoilers, but if you've read so far then I believe you don't mind it. There's a teenager struggling with suicidal tendencies and gender identity, a soldier who struggles with alcoholism, a lady who self-harms and has a broken heart (pun not intended), a florist who's husband commited suicide, and another psychologist who suffers from anger problems. Each person has very diverse personalities and I quite liked everyone. The only person I could say I didn't like quite as much was the teenager, but maybe that's because of the way the author presented their dialogue.

&#x200B;

The story is told to us as if it were a doctor's appointment. Heart records the sessions (with the patient's permission) ala Ben Harmon from AHS, and we proceed with getting to know the patient. Because this is structured to feel like a conversation with people who are quite emotionally unstabble for whatever reason they might have, some bits of conversation feel like they're all over the place. I felt this mostly in the first chapter, with the teenager. As we've established, the teenager is suicidal and deals with gender identity issues. I liked that the author focused on the teen's life and feelings without hammering home the point that they are suicidal or whatever, thus making it feel a bit more genuine. Because of this, however, the characters go from Heart asking the teen how they view their own life to why they feel like their gender isn't right for them. To me, at least, this felt a bit poorly structured, but nevertheless I still enjoyed the chapter. From chapter 2 and onward I didn't notice much of this, whether it was because they were topics I could relate to more, or because the author did a better job at communicating the topics, I don't know.

&#x200B;

Despite anything I've implied so far, I loved the characters, especially the last person Heart sees before the big finale. It's as if I was talking with one of my friends and that felt awesome. Speaking of the finale, I think it's where it might make or break, for some people. I personally really liked it, and shared this story before with a friend of mine who suffers from the same issues the author seemed to describe in the chapter and she says that it checks out (to add to this, since I'm trying not to spoil too too much, she did also mention that what happens in the finale has happened to her, and can happen to others like her, but the severity depends from person to person). Nevertheless, realism or lackthereof aside, I'd recommend suspending your disbelief for the finale, even though I did quite like it.

&#x200B;

I'm sure I did a horrible job on reviewing this book. This was my first review and I've only discovered this sub a few days ago, so apologies. All in all I quite liked the book and feel like the topics were tackled with a gentle touch. I don't know if the author has any experience with the traumas mentioned in the book, but I think he might, considering how in depth he goes in some of them (again, this is just me speculating), and so that helped make this an easy read, despite how graphic some descriptions can get (graphic as in the author doesn't try to sugarcoat it when characters are suicidal, for example). I also liked that the author didn't try to sell me on some ""hope and love is all I need"" type of message - mind you, at the end of the story it does feel like that's what we're left with, but through Heart we see the author being quite real and saying that just because a character feels better after their session with Heart, it doesn't mean they'll get better all of a sudden and that the battle against, say, depression, is an everyday struggle that people unfortunately have to deal with.

&#x200B;

t7vp9r,"Underwhelming book scare me and I read too many reviews, before choosing a book!","I don't know exactly why..but I fear often about books which are underwhelming, the content, conclusion, characters etc.  Whenever I am looking to choose a new book to read, I tend to read reviews from multiple sites(popular newspaper articles or Redditt) to make sure I don't get disappointed reading that book and feel sad that I wasted precious time.

bt9lal,Reading the classics has helped me rediscover my love of reading,"I was a voracious reader in my youth, I never counted but I would probably get through about 15 books a year during my high school years

Now as a busy adult I tried to get back into the habit. I searched online for the best books, headed to my local bookshop and picked up various novels. 

I tried them but found I just couldn't get in to them. I got to various points in The Way of Kings, Ready Player One, The Dark Tower book 1, and Mistborn before giving up

I'm not sure why I couldn't get into them but I found the writing was just really bad. I think it also didn't help that I was reading books I thought I was *supposed* to read instead of just reading what I wanted

I went back to the internet and found lists of some older, critically acclaimed books, ""classics"" if you will. And let me tell you, this has sparked an interest in reading I haven't felt since high school.

In the past few months I've got through The Great Gatsby, Count of Monte Cristo, Ulysses, Crime and Punishment, A Tale of Two Cities and A Picture of Dorian Gray

I had some trepidation as I'd heard they were too stuffy and boring to read nowadays but the writing in those books is absolutely beautiful and they carried incredibly profound insights into the human condition that made me feel like I was almost a new person, with a new view of the world

I guess what I'm trying to say is it's important to just read what you want. There will always be snobs telling you not to read a book because it's too old fashioned and not ""cool"" but this kind of elitist and pretentious attitude is only going to turn you away from books you might potentially enjoy!

100xnc9,"Can ""How to Win Friends & Influence People"" Help me Make Friends?","I picked up this book for the same reason we all did. I struggle to make friends. Am experiencing a serious lack of a social life right now. And I'm desperate to fix all those things. I've delved into self-help a little before (Tony Robbins, Alain De Botton, Napoleon Hill) and was largely unimpressed. I was shocked to find Dale Carnegies work to be so... Profound. It's truly an amazing book; one I believe we should all read. Yet, at the same time, I wonder if it really provides the advice I was looking for.

In the opening chapter we are not given encouragement, or a pep talk, rather we are told the stories of violent mobsters such as Al Capone & Two Gun Crowley. Why? Because they provide examples for aspects of human nature, intuitive & reasonable, that Carnegie hopes to open our mind to.

These men.. Violent, selfish, and wicked as they may be did not consider themselves so. They were, as we all are, rather quick to condemn others, slow to criticize ourselves, and ultimately concerned with our own needs. Are we not?

All of us have a unique perspective of the world, one colored by the fundamental human desire: ""the need to be great.""

Al Capone, Crowley, acted (as we all do) based on their social needs. One of which is the need for: validation, respect, admiration–love. While not all of us resort to crime to get it... It's easy to see how one may justify anything if is necessary. Carnegie understood, long before our social media addicted generation, just how badly we crave the respect of other individuals.

Using this knowledge, Carnegie provides us with concrete, practical advice on how exactly it is we can earn the respect, loyalty, and gain influence over the people around us.

Praise others – who doesn't want praise?

If you must correct... Do it indirectly and gently... Be sure to state your own faults first & always begin with praise. And Don't forget to state your belief that you hold them to a high standard.

If you have a plan you want them to follow... Let the other person think of it. Give subtle suggestions. Hints. Use the Socratic method. Let them believe your idea is their idea.

Smile!

Never insult!

And, by no means, EVER argue!

*How to Win Friends* is not so much a self-help book as it is an instruction manual. Based on an intuitive  understanding of human psychology. One built for people like you and me. People not necessarily blessed with great reputation, power, status, or rhetorical ability. It gives effective advice on how to get people to like and respect you. Advice that anyone can follow.

Smiling is absolutely free. And who doesn't love to be smiled at?

For all it's strengths Carnegie's book has been widely criticized. The main accusation being that it promotes manipulative tactics, and encourages people to act in insincere ways for the purpose of getting people to do what you want them to do.

I think this critique is fair, yet misguided. Carnegie doesn't simply say do X to get people to do Y. He argues for way of living and relating to the people around us.

Citing figures such as Jesus, Buddha, Laozi, Washington and Franklin. Carnegie provides convincing reasons for adapting his method. Note that Carnegie never once asks us to lie to people. Instead he states that, when for example we are to praise & encourage others, we ought to give sincere praise. Quoting Emerson he says *""every man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I learn from him.""* Carnegie asks us to see the strengths and virtues in others. Attempt to see the world from their perspective. In this way we may better both understand our neighbor and see how we can best cooperate. Wouldn't it be great if we *all* acted according to such principles?

That being said, we can still ask the following: ""this advice may get people to admire me, or enjoy  my company, gain influence on people...but will it help me make *real* friends?""

It's hard to think that we've really made a true friend if following principles of human psychology was necessary to earn their approval.

The best and deepest friendships we can imagine seem the opposite of this.

We think of a friend as someone we can be our genuine, natural, authentic–even sometimes somewhat problematic– true selves with. People with whom we can laugh when we are happy, cry when we are said, will be willing to listen to our sporadic/tangential/philosophical rants, accepting of our unique idiosyncrasies, and will yet love us anyway.

It doesn't seem obvious at all that following Carnegie's advice is the most effective way to find and build those relationships.

It is here, I think, we must accept a simple truth: such relationships are few and hard to come by.

If we can count our deepest, truest friends on both hands we are truly blessed, and even among those relationships boundaries and differences of sentiment will always exist. And be needed.

Carnegie's advice is still, I think, generally great advice to follow. And, indeed, necessary to thrive in the world unless one aspires to live a secluded life deep in the woodlands.

By amassing a large social network, gaining respect and recognition, by thriving and succeeding, will we not find ourselves most capable to find those people with whom we can be most authentic? It's hardly going to happen if one decides to live their days dwelling in a basement!

People will be most able to appreciate our genuine and unique selves when we are the best version of ourselves. And that is what Dale Carnegie's work helps us to be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/100xnc9/can_how_to_win_friends_influence_people_help_me/,2023-01-02T00:03:38Z,10,8,books,Me Before You,POST

gykvrj,I finished Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente and it left me in a weird place. Has anyone else had a book that just sent them spiraling?,"On a whim, I bought and read Space Opera as a friend suggested it to me. I enjoy reading bad books and generally making fun of them, but Space Opera was just on an entirely different level. It felt like I was on LSD the entire time I was reading the book and it left me speechless. It's the kind of book that you can't put down no matter how hard you try, and if you just leave it sitting there with the bookmark in it, it haunts you from wherever you set it. It's like a bad dream that you can't help but think about over and over again and until you finish it and see it through to the end, it will always be there and you won't be able to get it out of your head and move on with your life. This book sent me down into a spiral like no other book has before and I'm not quite sure how to deal with it. 

&#x200B;

It is truly an insane and wild ride from start to finish, and time seems to fly by while you're reading it. Before you know it, you're done with the book and you have the rest of the day to do things, except I can't quite find myself able to do anything. All I can think about is the stupid book, wondering just why it exists and for what purpose. It is unique on a different scale and left me nearly catatonic by the time I finished it, just staring up at my ceiling in unveiled and unbridled horror and shock. I have never met a book that has done this to me before. I feel like getting this off of my chest will finally allow me to break my stupor so I can actually do things with my day. 

&#x200B;

Space Opera isn't good. It's unique, but it is not a good book. It's bizarre and utterly indescribable. The only way to truly understand it is to read it, but I'm not sure anyone should.  

&#x200B;

Have any of you ever run into a book that just left you feeling odd and in a state of shock (be it for good or bad) after finishing it? If you have read Space Opera, are these feelings out of the ordinary for this dumpster fire of a book?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gykvrj/i_finished_space_opera_by_catherynne_m_valente/,2020-06-07T21:22:47Z,2,11,books,Me Before You,POST
15bqvay,I am being told that reading corrupts me!,"


I'll admit it, I read a lot. Like I spend almost all my free time reading. I just graduated from college and is now searching for a job. I lived my 6 years in college through various phases. When I got into college, I was very immature and tried to be the centre of attention all the time, being goofy and dancing without rhythm, you get the idea. 
Then I got into a relationship, and she showed me my first glimpse of compassion. Till then, I was very very much self centred and narcissistic, and thought the world was revolving around me.
Slowly and surely, I saw the my (and my peers') narcissism and superiority complex over other groups, and began to work to resolve that.
I stopped using drugs and alcohol, and didn't partake in any activity that will take other people's right to have fun. But then, I lost most of my friends since I dont align with their views.

Then covid hit. Till then I only read non fiction. I started reading more and more self help books. I did some stockmarket trading stuff, read about that a lot. I learned to play the harmonica. 
I was leaning more towards money and financial independence as my life philosophy, I wouldn't stop talking about it. 
I needed to learn how to learn faster (meta learning I guess) for my exams and then I stumbled across mind/memory palace and my attention shifted to it and its other implications. One thing led to another, I read about being able to make memory palaces in the dreams and started reading on lucid dreaming and found success in it. I was baffled by the new world I found in dreams. So I researched more about dreams and it led to Sigmund Freud and to Carl Jung. He had explanations for most of the behaviours I found irrational. I started my dream journal and had profound insights about my personality and my life as a whole. It led me to the philosophical implications of life and started reading philosophical books- both non fiction and fiction. I always despised fiction as children's story, but I found that classics are not so. I read some classic books and found Dostoevski. I read most of his major books and as side quests read philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche and Russel.

By this time I started writing journals and delved deep into self reflection. 
I started looking at stories differently. I started to watch movies for their ideas, began to critically journal about the themes in the work. 

The thing is, by then, my whole appearance (inside and out) was changed. The way I talk was changed, I became more empathetic, I could manage to have deep conversations for hours with anyone and people seemed to have more trust in me in confiding things. I am now more interested in psychological aspect of life than physical aspect. I was an Atheist and now I believe in a grander scheme (but not in god as per our traditional sense). I constantly think about death and its significance. I think of us living beings as sensory organs of the universe (since we are all one) and we are trying to make sense of what we(universe) are. I believe consciousness is the latest step of universe in understanding itself (this view must have inspired from Jung). So the best we can do in this world is to help the universe by helping others since we are one.
I am derailing from the topic...

But this change in philosophical outlook and my views are supposedly making me boring. I give earthly possessions less value than before. People say I am still young to have this mindset. Is this a problem? Should I stop reading and live my life normally? Does anyone else had this stage in your life and what did you do? Please help

Tldr: Reading books have obviously changed my outlook on world and the change is not to other people's taste. And it is hurting to see me as they see me as someone gone off the rails. What should I do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15bqvay/i_am_being_told_that_reading_corrupts_me/,2023-07-28T07:52:29Z,21,10,books,Me Before You,POST
103zqx2,The Fountainhead offered me a lot to think about,"Just finished reading The Fountainhead, and I’m very positively impressed. I was going into it with little to no expectations, having heard little about Objectivism or Ayn Rand before. (fun fact, I decided to pick up the book simply because I heard a netflix series character raving about it, so I was like yeah, let’s see what’s all the buzz about).

I’ve looked over a bunch of posts discussing the FH and the opinions seem to be as polarizing as the book itself.

Although I intended to share what I liked about the book, I can’t help but say that one word kept popping up in my head throughout the entire book. The word is crude. Crude because of the fairly basic writing and, even more so, the overly straightforward way characters’ feelings are revealed. That is, the author chews and rechews everything that’s going on in the characters’ heads, leaving no possibility for you to read into their actions and ponder their intentions. Sometimes I wished she said less and gave me a chance to think myself. 

That being said, I had the best time reading it and thinking about the ideas circulating the plot. 

I realized the importance of being genuinely passionate about whatever it is you’re devoting your life to. It’s inspiring to see Roark being truly in love with his craft (“you must love the doing, not the secondary consequences”). 

My definition of “ego” and “selfishness” has taken on a new meaning. Previously, both held wicked connotations in my head and were inevitably linked to pride, vanity, and the unprincipled pursuit of one’s desires. Now I see that being selfish ≠ f over others and doing whatever it takes to get the desired. 

To be selfish is to stay true to one’s ideals and not trade them for approval and validation from others. On that note, “three glided balls as a symbol of humanity as we know it” is perhaps my favorite symbolic reference in the entire book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/103zqx2/the_fountainhead_offered_me_a_lot_to_think_about/,2023-01-05T14:06:03Z,3,0,books,Me Before You,POST
ilh8pn,Someone on this subreddit recommended The Man Called Ove to me. This is what I have to say...,"I'll try to keep this short, even though I could never fall short of words for the masterpiece that is A Man Called Ove, a book that someone on this subreddit sugessted to me. 

One might think, why is the story of an old man with childlike tantrums and zero tolerance so enticing to someone who has significantly better content to go through, especially at this particular point of time. Well, I surprised myself when I started reading this book and stumbled upon an enigma of emotions, both melancholic and cheerfulness but nonetheless equally heartwarming. Every couple of paragraphs, I paused to laugh or I paused to resort to a state that was very close to sobbing. This was particularly difficult to manage, especially when I was reading it in a public place. I messaged one of my friends, saying ""This book is making me do weird things"", and when he replied with ""What's the book about?"", I said, ""It's the story of a man with superficial hate for everyone yet an equally vast ocean of compassion, empathy and love inside him."" Well, this particular friend says ""Wow, he must have been treated unfairly before,"" and he was absolutely spot on. I really don't want to divulge any spoilers here in case anyone decides to read this piece of fiction, but if you can get your hands on it (Just ping me otherwise), lose yourself in it. I promise you, by the end of the book, you'll be crying like an estranged soul and laughing like a free one.

At the same time.

zscu55,Ann Leckie's writing style/storytelling has ruined all other writing for me 😭,"I just finished the Imperial Radch trilogy and Provenance. Now I'm reading The Three Body problem, which I trust is a good novel, but I'm really hurting for Leckie's style. First off, she's just a master of exposition. Anytime she reveals new information about the universe of her novels, she does it through character interactions and other events that give good and plausible reasons for this information to be revealed. And her style in general is so economical. She doesn't worry about holding your hand, she gives you exactly enough information to figure out what's going on. And as a less prolific reader I found myself having to flip some pages back and forth to understand the different motivations and interactions going on in a scene, but the information I needed was always there. Yet ultimately I never thought her writing was confusing or laid out poorly; it all fit together like intricate clockwork that made the initial confusion worth it.

I'm about 70 pages into The Three Body problem, and it's not bad, but, especially with the part >!where Wang figures out that the countdown only happens when he takes the pictures!< it seems like *I'm* figuring things out before the characters are, and not in a dramatically ironic way. It also contains a bit of overly poetic language? imo. Like purple prose I guess?

It was incredible, 10/10. The whole time it feels like a simple science fiction story from a magazine from the 50s, which it is, but it's *so* good.

The ending especially was just so surprising it was what made me stare at the ceiling, with awe.

dlhyo,Help me own my books,"(Cross post from AskReddit since it didn't receive much attention there.)

I'm reading [How to Read a Book](http://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Touchstone-book/dp/0671212095) by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren at the moment (recommended) and would like to become a more active reader, as described in the book. There is, however, one thing I know I'll find hard to do - taking notes in books.

**Note that this is primarily for when reading for information and/or understanding, not reading for entertainment.** You can read Adler's opinions regarding marking and ""owning"" books here: http://radicalacademy.com/adlermarkabook.htm

To me writing in a book just feels incredibly *wrong* - I was raised to not even write in exercise books where you were supposed to give the answer on ______s (the reason being that we borrowed the books from the school and weren't allowed to write in them). To me writing in a book is like an Apple fanboy putting a permanent sticker on his new shiny MacBook. Now I'm not a big fan of Apple but that's beside the point.

I've read [the](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/d0yzx/taking_notes_on_a_book/) [other](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/beqzc/redditors_do_you_take_notes_as_you_read/) [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/btkq7/who_takes_notes_while_they_are_reading/) about note-taking and plan to start doing it soon, but first I have a few questions for those who already take notes:
 
* What do you write with? (I plan to use a mechanical pencil.)
* If you return to a marked book and find your embarrassing notes, do you erase/correct the ""bad""/""incorrect"" ones?
* What about elegant books, do you buy a second copy to take notes in? I think I'll need a lot of practice before I dare to write in my [The] Feynman Lectures on Physics, for example...
* If you find a word you don't know, do you mark it and write the definition/translation in the margin?
* What do you think about folding page corners?
* Any tips for a newbie like me?

**TL;DR: Answer the questions above regarding taking notes in books.**

-

And just some clarifications:

* I buy most books I read, and of course I won't write in books I've borrowed.
* It's very rare for me to lend books, so that's not a problem.
* Yes I've thought about alternatives such as writing in a notebook or on post-it notes, but ultimately I think writing notes in books would be best.

As a side note, oh how I look forward to good and cheap(er) e-readers.

**EDIT1:** Nice to see some reactions here, thanks everyone for your feedback!

**EDIT2:** Made the note a bit clearer to avoid misunderstanding.

**EDIT3:** Removed the quote, since it sent the wrong message to some people. No, I *don't* think you're a worse reader or that you don't ""own"" your books because you don't scribble in them, I just think that taking notes will help *me* get more out of my books and want some advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dlhyo/help_me_own_my_books/,2010-10-01T14:13:20Z,84,16,books,Me Before You,POST
ny7qad,Watching the Dune movie first helped me appreciate the book more,"So, I watched the David Lynch movie this year. It's not great but throughout I kept thinking how cool the world is and how I want to explore it more. I even went on a binge of YouTube videos that explained the universe further. I couldn't wait to read the book but I had to get through a different series I started (Stormlight Archive) before delving into Dune. And now that I'm finally reading it, I can't put it down. It's giving me exactly what I wanted as I get to learn about this awesome world in detail. Which takes me to the point of the title of this post. I've read plently of opinions about the begining of the book being a slog to get through. I think the reason why I don't feel this way is because I have an understanding of what's going on because I watched the film first. I can see how someone who doesn't have any clue about the weird terminology and mythology would be very confused and were I in that position I might've sttuggled with the book. All the details, politics and scheming are enthralling to me and I can't get enough of it because it expands on my existing, small knowledge of the universe. Has anyone else watched the mediocre movie before reading the book? I don't hate the movie, it's servicable but I think that it's main quality lies in it being a sample of the world and a nice starter for those that want to get into the Dune universe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ny7qad/watching_the_dune_movie_first_helped_me/,2021-06-12T14:15:57Z,11,30,books,Me Before You,POST

She didn't wrote a lot of book, yet her last and most famous one : Kallocain, is often overlooked and forgotten when speaking about 20th century sci-fi.

However she released it in 1940, 9 years before 1984 was released, it take place in a dystopian world, with a totalitarian government. A scientific create a truth serum, and you'll have to read it to know more!

Evgueni Zamiatine - Us

Aldous Huxley - Brave new world

Karin Boye - Kalocain 

George Orwell - 1984

95387z,"It took me almost 4 months to finish my first Novel, IT by Stephen King and it was so worth the read.","This novel was great honestly. I never liked reading because I found it to be boring and not entertaining. The only reading I did was in school where we read some boring books I could careless about, until last year where we started reading some good stuff like Fahrenheit 451 and The Great Gatsby I grew to admiring books. Instead of thinking of them as a 'chore' or 'assignment' but intead as what they should be. Art.

So earlier last year IT got a movie adaptation and being me I watched the old 1990 TV special before I saw the movie with my friend. We both really enjoyed the movie and couldn't wait for the second part, so we talked about wanting to read the book. After finding out IT was a novel of over 1,000 pages my friend and I felt less motivated to read it. But my friend bought the novel anyways. He gave up in like the first 20 pages. He let me read it and I only got to about 170 pages before I stopped.
Over the whole school year I left the novel and had at random felt like reading it again. There was just something so odd about a novel thats mature and fascinating at the same time, yet all in your head.

So time pasted, but at the end of the school year around May when we finished some of those good books, I decided to restart the novel. Read IT till the every end and even if I didn't like the reading part I be happy with the idea of completion. It took a LONG time (almost 4 months) to finish because of my slow reading, but it was definitely worth it.

I'm glad I stook with the novel and I was so happy with the way Stephen King wrights that I picked up The Dark Tower series as I was fascinated with the idea if a tower connecting a bounch of multiverses together. I didn't watch the movie, but I plan to after I finish the series.

Finally I want to thank this sub for motivating me to read with it's positive posts about how great reading is. I definitely recommend this novel to anyone whos a fan of horror or Stephen King's work. Thank you guys and thank you Stephen King for a great read and hopefully future great reads as well.

Edit - Thank you all of the great comments and insights. I wont be reading The Dark Tower series just yet as someone has informed me it would be a better choice to read some more.

324z4d,Someone Please Help Me. I Finished Reading Flowers for Algernon Last Night and I Stop Thinking About Charlie. And I Can't Stop Crying.,"If you have read the short story or novel you probably know what I am going through... but I can't explain how this book - the character of Charlie has seared into my brain. I feel so much sympathy, and love, and compassion for him. No one really talks about what a sweet and gentle soul he was before he became ""smart"". I just loved his character so much and wanted him to be okay. I felt so bad about all of the things that happened to him from when he was a child up until the ending of the book - and the way Keyes made him such a compelling character. The stories about how he would help his sister with a new puppy. How his mom would hit him when he made in his pants. The kids and his co-workers making fun of him... This book has absolutely devastated and changed my life.

How could someone so innocent and pure as Charlie be so tormented by things that were completely out of his or anyone's control? But yet he still remembered Algernon, he was still a good person, he had a really sweet soul.. It just breaks my heart so bad and I can't stop thinking about him.. this character. The character and story of Charlie and Algernon is the most heartbreaking, touching and bittersweet story I have ever read. I just wanted him to be okay in the end. 

I know this has been discussed many times on Reddit before, but would anyone else like to write or say something about Charlie?? Please tell me how you feel about him and describe him in your own way. Or how you related to him through the brilliant writing style of Keyes.

ol89kr,Just a little thing that slightly bothers me from an otherwise good book.,"Anyone here recognizes Jeremy Robinson? He's probably well known for starting a new subgenre called ""Kaiju Thriller"" with his Project Nemesis novel, which continued to 4 more books in the nemesis Saga series.

There's this one scene in the 4th novel, Project Hyperion, where Maigo Hudson, someone who was once connected to the kaiju Nemesis, tried to infiltrate a secret mining operation to uncover an ancient weapon buried under Big Diomede. Having visited that place herself earlier with her team and detected the weapon, she then wanted to take the weapon herself before it fell into a wrong hand. She was knocked unconscious from a dynamite explosion, and woke up in a medical bay stripped to her underwear and tied to a stretcher under the scrutiny of the villains of the novel, and having her DNA sample taken. She had encountered one of the villains before.

Should the captors immediately stripped her like that, since what needed to take DNA sample is to roll the sleeves, and to confiscate contrabands you just have to take out everything in her pockets? Is this a form of minor sublimated fetish, or simply a ""fanservice'?

My new book is set at a remote farm on the northern California coast and is inspired by my love of Gothic novels. It’s a modern ghost story about eighteen-year-old Mila, who has just placed out of the foster system and is eager to be folded into the farm's large family. But on her first night there, she sees a ghost on the field, and soon, long-buried memories from her past start haunting her as well. Watch Over Me is about coming to terms with life we had before--the bad and the good parts--in order to accept and fully inhabit the lives that we have now. When I’m not writing you’ll often find me talking about writing on my podcast or with the students of the writing class I teach. My family (which includes my wife and our daughter) moved into a duplex with our friend (and fellow writer) in San Francisco, and it’s been a crazy time!

s40spz,Scottie Pippen Unguarded made me reflect,"The 90s  bulls era has always peeked my interest. First as fan of the game, then as a person that want to understand the team topology, and why the team(s) was so great.  You have Eleven Rings: The Soul of Success, by Phil Jackson that goes on detail on this.  

Unguarded is in many ways the same story, but written from a players perspective. The book covers more in detail on a single view and is a nice way to get some of the spice missing from Eleven Rings.

In a way it fits well into the puzzle of Eleven Rings, the Netflix series: The last dance and now  Unguarded.  I am not sure how many more views we need of this bulls era. The book  reuses known facts. It hurts the book that the story has been told many times before.

Be warned:  Unguarded is mostly based in stats, and I will not recommend it for non basketball nerds",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/s40spz/scottie_pippen_unguarded_made_me_reflect/,2022-01-14T19:44:28Z,4,12,books,Me Before You,POST

dpope9,"First time ever reading The Wheel of Time, come join me on my journey","So...yeah, this is bound to be an exciting epic journey that may take me years.

I just got out of a 13 month incredibly toxic relationship and during this process of rebuilding my life back together I thought I’d take on the daunting task of reading this entire series, or at least START this daunting task.

I will post my thoughts on every single chapter in this thread right here, so this really is going to be a full on, epic journey. I have the first book in front of me right now and I’ve already read a few pages of the prologue before putting it down to make this post.

Keep in mind, I’ve never read an epic fantasy series before. I’ve read Harry Potter, but never Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. I have watched the LotR movies though. I did read the first three books of The Dark Tower and I REALLY loved the first and the third book...not so much the second, i found it kind of boring.

My guess is its gonna take me a few months to get through each book. They seem long as hell.

So...here we go. I’ll finish the prologue today, but idk how long each chapter is gonna take me. Depending on their length, maybe two days per chapter. I don’t wanna make it a chore, because then I’ll just procrastinate, but like I said, I hope to get through a book about every 3-4 months.

I must say NO SPOILERS OF ANY KIND!!! NOT EVEN HINTS LIKE “OH YOU LOVE THIS CHARACTER? JUST YOU WAIT!”. FROM WHAT IVE HEARD THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY AMAZING SERIES THAT IS BEST TO GO THROUGH BLIND.

s30a08,Is it just me or Killing Commendatore doesn't feels right?,"I am 50+ pages in and one thing I noticed is that the writing feels kinda weird and off, it doesn't feel like Murakami usual writing style. Like in his other work, even his more ""grounded/realistic"" novel, he has this style of writing that grabs people attention (atmospheric? Sorry I am very bad at expressing my feelings), but in this latest novel of his, everything feels kinda bland. 50+ pages in and I still enjoyed the book very much, but it just doesn't feels right for a Murakami's Novel. 

Maybe I am still early on, and in the later chapters his magical writing style will starts to spark(hopefully that's the case). But either way, I still enjoy the plot even though it's a little slow at the start. What do you guys think? Is it just me who feels that way as I've heard other people mentioned this before (they said it might be the translation quality and etc).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/s30a08/is_it_just_me_or_killing_commendatore_doesnt/,2022-01-13T14:09:26Z,7,7,books,Me Before You,POST
qul18,"I just watched Midnight in Paris, and this line from Hemingway's character completely blew me away... Can this be attributed to any of his writing, or was this an extrapolation of his philosophy?","“All men fear death. It’s a natural fear that consumes us all. We fear death because we feel that we haven’t loved well enough or loved at all, which ultimately are one and the same. However, when you make love with a truly great woman, one that deserves the utmost respect in this world and one that makes you feel truly powerful, that fear of death completely disappears. Because when you are sharing your body and heart with a great woman the world fades away. You two are the only ones in the entire universe. You conquer what most lesser men have never conquered before, you have conquered a great woman’s heart, the most vulnerable thing she can offer to another. Death no longer lingers in the mind. Fear no longer clouds your heart. Only passion for living, and for loving, become your sole reality. This is no easy task for it takes insurmountable courage. But remember this, for that moment when you are making love with a woman of true greatness you will feel immortal.

I believe that love that is true and real creates a respite from death. All cowardice comes from not loving or not loving well, which is the same thing. And when the man who is brave and true looks death squarely in the face like some rhino hunters I know or Belmonte, who is truly brave, it is because they love with sufficient passion to push death out of their minds. Until it returns, as it does to all men. And then you must make really good love again.

rsci9f,“Come with me” - Ronald Malfi,"I read this book in almost less than a week I would say. It was simply gripping from beginning to end. The way the mystery unfolds from the moment of his wife’s death to the very end just has you hooked. When I wasn’t reading, I was thinking about this story. Thinking about who the killer could be. Thinking about how I would do the same exact thing as the husband. I looked forward to reading every morning and every night until I finished the book and the ending was perfect. There is also a dedication at the end that’s beautiful as well. 

It’s funny, I stopped into Barnes and Noble to kill some time before catching the spider man movie. I always go to the horror, fantasy, scifi section and this book cover caught my eye.

1x6u18,"What do ""Alice in Wonderland,"" contemporary poetry, and astronomy have in common? Ask me that, ask me about my book ""Alice's Sister,"" or AMA, really.","When I was a kid my father and I read ""Alice in Wonderland"" before sleep and our dreams were populated with their own strange worlds.  Meanwhile my mother took us to dark fields with mugs of hot chocolate and blankets--meteor showers and aurorae overhead.  The result was my fascination with the layers of reality--the world we live in, and all of the worlds inside of it.  The more I learned of the world and its inhabitants the *curiouser and curiouser* I got.

I went to MIT for college, thinking I might study astronomy.  But real-life astronomy was not as romantic as my childhood interactions with it, and I ended up studying writing, specifically poetry.  It wasn't until graduate school at the University of Michigan that I ""rediscovered"" Lewis Carroll's story.  Among other things that stood out to me in the book was a character I hadn't remembered at all--Alice's sister, Mary.  I was also curious what was happening in Alice's waking life that she was having such disturbing dreams.  So I wrote a book to answer that question.  The book, unlike most poetry books, has a plot and characters.  It's also disturbingly dark, such that sometimes I have a hard time talking about it.  It's called, simply, ""Alice's Sister.""

Nonetheless, I would love to talk about it with you.  I'd also love to talk about

- poetry in general, 

- print versus digital books, 

- teaching writing and books (I've taught college-level writing for nearly a decade),

- the publishing world (I went through the traditional route, worked with an editor, etc., but I've also read for book contests before and seen what a mess they are!),

- astronomy,

-  cinnamon  (BIG cinnamon fan),
 
- whatever else thrills your boat.

a0e1yi,Convince me A Little Life is a good book. Please.,"I'm sorry if this has already been done a million times but I've just finished it and I really didn't like it. I'm interested in the opinion of people who really liked it, what specifically they liked about it. Also I'm very interested in people who didn't like it as well to see if what they didn't like was different to what I thought.

I'll include a summary of what I didn't like so you have something to respond to although forgive me because I'm still struggling to put into words why I disliked this book so much. 

- None of the characters are agents in their own lives, they're all victims. Things happen to them both good and bad but they never have any agency and it's both sad and immensely frustrating.

- All the happy moments seem to be in the book only to provide some limited form of contrast for the generally horrific backstory of Jude. 

- Despite the fact that you see these characters cook and eat meal after meal of insert ingredient with sexy adjective here and do things that rich people do, like building their 5th holiday home and donating to charity and oh they're edgy because they're rich but they are also seriously fucked up. The merry go round spins faster and faster and we're in London, Rome, The Alhambra, Bhutan. Despite all that........... it's just so empty. Maybe this existential emptiness is the point but I don't think so.

- Their lives don't feel real and that's the worst thing about the whole book because you realise you are reading a book which has a sole purpose of examining how deep down the torture-well you can go before you give up. 

- I almost wondered if the superficial shells of characters were created as some sort of test. JB is the most hollow caricature of the lot, he's pretty much just a plot point with Malcolm not far behind. Willem could have been more because of the hundreds of pages he gets. But nope, he's just an enabling moron who resembles no human that has ever or will ever exist. His emotions are stunted like some pre-pubescent teen and yes I get that part of him is stuck in that phase because of his own family trauma but no don't think it' good writing. 

- I don't really want to go into depth about why Jude is a bad character because it's just sad, he is the victim's victim. On trying to describe the book to a friend I went through exactly what happens to Jude and when you list it out it's pretty ridiculous.

His birth parents abandon him and a catholic monastery takes him in. In the monastery he is systematically raped almost every night by some of the brothers. He is beaten and flogged and at one stage has his hand lit on fire. He then befriends an aloof brother who at first seems to be the only good one, but no. This brother runs away with him and pimps him around the US to thousands of men who do horrible things to him. In between sessions with the clients the brother rapes him night after night. The brother also teaches him to cut himself, something he does heavily for the rest of the book. Then the police show up and the brother hangs himself in front of Jude. He is then taken into care where he continues to be raped. He eventually escapes and hitch hikes across America paying for his travels by fucking any man who wants him. He then starts prostituting himself where he is taken in by a ""Doctor/psychiatrist"" who imprisons him in a dungeon, beats him and rapes him. This man then runs him over and leaves him crippled for the rest of his life. He goes to university and has a period of good fortune where he makes friends, gets a degree and an adoptive family, this is done solely to provide a platform to explore his trauma. He gets into a relationship with an abusive man who rapes him and nearly beats him to death. He tries to commit suicide and fails. He eventually has his legs amputated, his life partner dies in a car crash, and he ends the story by committing suicide. You don't need to read this book. That paragraph above is what you're ultimately in for. 

- There's no real friendship in the book, just people pretending to be friends. By the time the ""friends"" intervene in Jude's life you actually wish they wouldn't. They've stood around for 35+ years, enabling his spiral of destruction and now in his early fifties they finally care enough to actually intervene? This just serves to drag the book out another 50 pages. I understood the internal logic Yanagihara used to justify why the friends don't question Jude and help him properly but I don't agree with it. I also don't agree with the quote ""friendship is nothing but the slow drip of miseries"". I mean certainly in this book it is. 

- The characters' great careers, where they all become masters of their universe and go to all these exotic places, feel like they're pulled from a single issue of a GQ magazine. In fact this whole book feels like a cross between a GQ magazine and a torture porn video. 

- The portrayal of gay characters is pretty poor. This book seems to have borrowed some stunted Mardi Gras view of what being a gay man is. JB and Caleb are the only real gay characters and they're just so horribly off. Jude and Willem are friends but I wouldn't say they're gay (they even say as much in the book). It saddens me this is considered the ""great gay novel"".

- One reviewer said of this book ""What real person trapped in this novel wouldn't become a drug addict?"" when referring to JB. I thought this was very apt.

- Even with all of these problems Yanagihara has a few moments of insight and clarity which are signs that she can write. I found a few quotes I found both true and profound and I'm happy to post them if you're interested.

ho6yr2,The Complete Maus by Art Spiegelman has me spellbound.,"I've read books based on the Holocaust before this one, but I was able to read them in a detached manner. The horrors of the concentration camps were to a degree unimaginable. But this book changed everything.
         There's something about this book, maybe the fact that it's a very personal account of the author's father who struggled and survived the Holocaust, or the fact that it's a graphic novel so you have a picture right in front of your eyes; it's unnerving. 
I think it's clever of the author to metaphorically represent Jews as mice, Nazis as cats, Poles as pigs because it has made the story even more impactful. 

This book made me read about Auschwitz, watch documentaries, all the while reminding me the chilling thought that human beings did this to other human beings and at that point, in that country it was legal.

Ask me anything!","I grew up in California and always wanted to write about its history. I also always wanted to write about Mark Twain. I had a vague sense that these two things were connected--that Mark Twain had spent time in San Francisco. But I didn't realize how formative those years were until I started researching my book. This was the 1860s, before Twain was famous, when he was still struggling to become a writer. As I dug deeper into the archives, I discovered that this young Twain belonged to an extraordinary community of other young, eccentric writers who lived in San Francisco during that time and called themselves the ""Bohemians."" This unique scene would mold Twain to literary maturity, and transform American literature at a moment when the Civil War and its turbulent aftermath was radically reforming the country.

ik44g1,[Crosspost] King's The Shining is scaring the hell out of me... but I am very intrigued and want to keep reading!,"\[So I figured I might get more advice in this community as it is bigger than the Stephen King subreddit, but if this is not allowed please do let me know/delete\]

So yeah. This is my first proper dive into horror. Tried to read Cell by Stephen King before and did not finish it, the pace didn't really pick up and I was bored – and it feels like a sci-fi apocalyptic novel rather than horror anyway. But though The Shining also had a slow start, this time the plot actually got me hooked. I care about the characters, and want to know what is going on.

The only problem being, I am getting scared as hell. Last night I read a good chunk (up to the start of Part Three) and literally kept waking up every once in a while because I was too scared to let myself fall asleep completely. Had to fully get up between 5 and 6am to pick up another book that would take my mind off it, and now my sleep pattern is all messed up lol. Needless to say, I won't be reading The Shining before bed again. But I do want to continue.

I know one of the issues for a few people in this subreddit seems to be that King's books are not scary enough rather than too scary, but unfortunately I am not one of those people. How do you guys manage to step away from the world of the book? And how did you come to enjoy horror books, if you weren't a horror novel person in the first place?

66h3ig,Thank you for getting me into Sci-fi Reddit!,"I came across [an article](http://blamcast.net/articles/best-science-fiction-books) 
a while back listing the top sci-fi books as suggested/upvoted by reddit. For no particular reason, the genre had never been of great interest to me, I tended to get my sci-fi kicks at the movies but I consumed mountains of all sorts of other stuff, either in print, ebooks or audio-books.

Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy was on there which I had read years ago (me and a billion others!) so I decided to start there. After about a year of almost solid science fiction, I'm loving discovering books that you all have been going on about for ages... I finally get what all the fuss was about!

So here's my progress so far and a thought or maybe a two on each book (without trying to give anything away to other laggards like me). 

Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy. Loved rereading this ludicrous, brilliant, insane, delightful book and obviously had to go on and read the rest of them. I also read 'And another thing' for the hell of it and then accidentally got sucked into Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. 

Enders Game. Enjoyed the movie but was blown away by the book. Followed it up with Speaker for the Dead which wasn't as good but by no means shoddy. It complimented and completed the story bringing it to a satisfying conclusion for me. 

Foundation. I screwed the pooch with this one by deciding to read the series in order starting with 'Prelude'. I got about halfway through the second book and was SO bored that I tossed them in a box in a cupboard cursing Asimov's name. My mate Dieter told me not to bother with all the other ones and just read Foundation for now. I'll go back to it sometime. 

Dune. Enormous, fantastic, epic, brilliant! Followed it up with Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. I know there's a few others after that but I decided I was all Duned out for a while... I'll go back and do the others sometime. 

Hyperion. I loved the writing and varying styles in this book and had no choice but to go and and read Fall of Hyperion, Endymion and Rise of Endymion. Yes, there were unanswered questions, yes there were some holes and questions but I truly loved the length and breadth of the whole tale. I will read them again. 

Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. I kept thinking 'Have I read this before?' before realising this was the book Blade Runner was based on. Not my favourite on the list but an enjoyable read that ends up swimming in your subconscious and surfacing to ask awkward questions... existential ones!

I, Robot. Ok, Mr Asimov, I apologise for cursing your name because I was sucked in and engrossed with this one. 

Starship Troopers. Ok, the movie was shite but entertaining shite... Denise Richards, Dina Mayer in the shower, fire-breathing bugs, you get where I'm coming from. I didn't have great expectations for the book to be honest but boy was I blown away. This may be the most riveting, engrossing, well-rounded and compelling books I've read since East of Eden. I finished the book, immediately bought the audio-book and did it all again. 

Neuromancer. I went straight to this from Starship Troopers and hated it. Not because the story is crap and not because the author is gormless but simply because the style is so jarringly different to Heinlein's eloquence. I get that it is an edgy story and needs to be written that way but it bugged me that every second word is 'fuck'! I got the audio book read by the author himself and didn't enjoy his narrating style either. I decided to put it down and come back to it some other time because I know I'll enjoy it more then. 

The Forever War. I really enjoyed this book - loved the concept and really empathised with the confusion and struggle of each readjustment each time... well you know what I mean! Another one of those books that play on your mind and it led me down an interesting rabbit hole of the author's life and experiences. I might get the audiobook of this one and re""read"" it. 

Rendezvous with Rama. I read this one almost by accident. I had sneaked in Michael Crichton's Sphere and my mate Dieter said that that book was a poor man's RwR. Not an entirely accurate analogy but I kinda see what he meant! Fan-bloody-tastic read and a wicked first bite at Arthur C Clarke. Reading it so soon after Hyperion,I was quite smug to recognise the inclusion and role of the Large Magellanic Cloud in both books. 

And that's all so far... I'm just starting Stranger in a Strange Land and have the 5 Old Man's War audiobooks ready and waiting for my day commute!

t1vbmm,Took me almost an hour of reading a chapter of Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software.,"I really love this book that's no joke, I'm in 15 chapters now, but, I'm sort of disappointed in myself. I don't know why though. I see people here completing books and even remembering almost all moments in it, but, I can't. Is this a problem with my memory? I tried to learn some speed reading techniques to see if I can take in a lot more so that I can understand more statements rather than words. That didn't work as well, I found myself regressing more, though speed reading does work somewhat when I'm reading newsletters and articles and whatnot. Alot of people on Reddit that have read this book say that this book is so easy that laymen can understand it easily, I have a hard time understanding this book, take today for example. Almost an hour took for me to complete one chapter. I enjoyed reading the chapter though because it's mind baffling to see just how circuits and codes are taken together and reached to this present era's technology.

135myq,What is a book that will absolutely force me to finish it?,"I've been in a funk lately that has made me lose interest in books and stop reading them around 2/3 of the way through. Maybe it's just that I'm reading the wrong books, but I just get the sense that I've gotten all that I can out of a book and finishing it won't add anything to the book. It's not that I'm reading any less, I just move on from books before they technically finish. This is bothering me.

What books can you suggest to me that will hold my attention until the very end? A little about me - I like hard scifi over fantasy scifi, I don't like literature-heavy books, and I am looking for a long(ish) book.

8tcb45,I think trying to read above my level has kept me from reading more often,"I have 5 books on my shelf that aren't graphic novels or comics. They're relegated to the bottom shelf and have been collecting dust for months now. They are as follows:


The Complete Cthulhu Mythos Tales by H.P. Lovecraft


The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde


The Original Folk & Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm


The Complete Tales and Poems of Edgar Allen Poe


The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams


I've only read 3 of Poe's short stories (Tell-Tale Heart, The Pit and The Pendulum, and Nevermore), one of the Grimm Tales (Companionship of the Cat and Mouse), read and re-read the first 2 chapters of the Picture of Dorian Gray, a good portion of the Cthulhu Mythos (Dagon, Nyarlathotep, The Colour out of Space, The Curse of Yig, etc.), and have just started reading The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.


My main problem seems to be mostly with the Picture of Dorian Gray and the Cthulhu Mythos. Both times I tried reading the Picture of Dorian Gray I couldn't go a single paragraph without having to either stop and google the definition of some archaic word or reread sentences multiple times to understand them at their most basic. The Cthulhu Mythos is even worse because Lovecraft *loved* using old English in as monotonous a tone as he could for most of his stories. I probably spent more time looking up definitions of words than actually reading the book. Eventually, I got burned out with both and stopped reading for a while.


Today I picked up The Hitchhiker's Guide and just reading the introduction before the story got my attention and I didn't find myself daydreaming while lazily reading each sentence. I don't hate The Picture of Dorian Gray or the Cthulhu Mythos, quite the contrary, I love horror, space, exploring the darker, uglier sides of human nature and the themes and summaries definitely get me interested. Reading it, however, is where I encounter most of my problems.

w07u4p,There was a book me and my best friend read at least 10 times in freshman year of high school. I later stole it from the library for him. Don’t worry. I paid the fine after.,"I cringe at this but we laugh about it non stop whenever it comes up. The book is called General’s of October by John Cullen. 

We read this book so many times! It was just great. It’s a thriller in the spirit of Tom Clancy. It’s about two officers trying to save the the US President during the second constitutional convention. 

The characters were pretty well flushed and believable for their backstories. 

All honesty, this should have been a movie and should have been in major print. We were so lucky we just found it by chance. 

Besides the copy I stole for him, I had to spend about 10 years searching for this book before I managed to find myself a copy. 

Unfortunately, it was re released digitally but around 60% of the book was gutted from it. It skips to around the 50% margin in the digital edition for chapter 1. It tosses out the MC backstory. The VP backstory, who was an early character to be killed off in first few chapters but his few appearances set up the story. 

I kept searching and was lucky to find a copy from the UK. I recommend this book 300%. 

If you can find this book, read the original version. Anyone who likes thrillers, political espionage, assassins, and an all out final act.

I have to say that it is so painful to read - because I truly care about this character. The first 15 chapters of the book are solely about the pain of Edmond and I got so impatient reliving that knowing full well that he will be taken advantage of. Will it be easier for me to bear when he starts talking to the other prisoner?

ivc5os,I'm reading Vox by Christina Dalcher that I love because it pisses me off!,"Vox by Christina Dalcher is quickly becoming one of my favourite books which is crazy to me because it royally pisses me off!

The premise is that (like most dystopias) woman have been stripped of almost all their rights but this one is special. It doesn't just restrict reading, writing, education, etc. It restricts how many words they can saw a day to 100. Just try and count how many words you say on average in a day and then imagine that if you said more than 100, you would get an electric shock. That is the fate of every woman in this world.

Before this took hold, the main character, Jean, was a scientist, specifically one working with the brain. Her speciality (I suppose you could call it) was working on a cure for Wernicke's Aphasia. I didn't know what this was so I looked it up (point to the book for making me do my own research) and discovered that it affects the part of the brain that allows us to register and use, of course, words. This comes up later in a critical way but I don't want to spoil anything because I genuinely think people, both men and woman need to read this.

Along the way, we also get her interacting with her family. There is her husband who pretends to show support for her but you know that his heart isn't in it at all, her eldest son who has become almost completely indoctrinated and does some really horrible things because of it, her twin boys who are too young to completely understand what is happening and her daughter who is under the same restrictions as Jean but is, again, too young to completely comprehend anything more complex than the bare bones of her situation.

I hope that more people read this because I really want to gush over it and how much it pisses me off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ivc5os/im_reading_vox_by_christina_dalcher_that_i_love/,2020-09-18T18:55:22Z,17,13,books,Me Before You,POST
i2hj5j,The Nightingale blew me away 10/10,"Iv been in quite the reading slump so I did what anyone else would do, I sat in my room with my favorite band (City and Colour) plying in the background and went through all my books I haven’t read and read the inserts and found one called The Great Alone by Kristin Hannah. It was amazing and I loved It so I picked up the other Kristin Hannah book I had already which was Winter Garden. It was also amazing! So I went to Books-A-Million and picked up what the internet told me was her best book. The Nightingale. 

This book ripped me apart and put me back together multiple times throughout the entirety of my read. Kristin Hannah has a way with making characters flawed yet so lovable. This book took me to France before the start of WW2 and dragged me through the war in the most heartbreaking and compelling read I think iv ever experienced. 

You follow the lives of two sisters and their part (or in some instances lack there of) in the women’s resistance in France. Often when I watch war movies or read books like this, women and civilians are mentioned in passing but this books takes you on a journey that can only be described as the Underground Railroad of France. You also get broken family affairs, sister and motherly love, the heartbreaking reality of what women, children, and civilians had to endure during the most decimating war the world has ever seen. 

Kristin Hannah makes this book impossible to put down, over 550 pages and I read It in two sittings. That’s how compelling It is. The ending is as beautiful as a sorry like this can be and made me cry real tears, which a book hasn’t made me do in years.

wqoav4,"A few months ago, I thought I didn't enjoy reading...and then 'Dune' flicked a switch in me","So, this is a little bit of an odd thing to be posting on a subreddit devoted to reading, but here we go. Apologies that this is a long one, as well; I don't know how to be terse with anything I write.

Generally speaking, until this year, I hadn't really read a book for about a decade now. The last time I did so, I was in high school (I'm not sure which one; it may have been of the play 'The Crucible' by Arthur Miller). I then went through a period where if I was reading printed material, it was either an instruction manual, or manga.

I tried over the last few years to read different books, including things like light novels, but to little success. It made me a bit worried that I was missing out on things, because I couldn't stick to them for long enough. I wasn't sure what exactly it was at the time; I figured I just wasn't in the right frame of mind for them, or I wasn't enjoying the text.

But then, earlier this year, I checked out the film adaptations of 'Dune' by Frank Herbert. Having watched both the David Lynch and Denis Villeneuve versions, I was intrigued by the setting and, a couple months ago, I sought out a copy of the book and decided that I would give it a go. I did consider a few warnings at the time from people who struggled to make their way through the whole book, but I gave it a go anyway.

Fast forward to today, and I'm a third of the way through 'Heretics of Dune', having read through four of the six Frank Herbert books. 'Dune' finally triggered something in me, something that tells me ""you really can read books after all"".

I understood very well why it was a science fiction phenomenon and how it inspired countless other sci-fi stories, be it printed or otherwise. It made excellent use of its setting, made great use of intrigue to keep the reader guessing what would happen next, and although the pacing was a bit weird at points, whenever there was action it was described in thorough detail but stopping short of excess. Really, the weakest part of the book was the numerous typesetting errors in my copy (including one character whose name was repeatedly misspelled as 'Piter de *Vried*').

However, I may have figured out why I've managed to keep to these books where I couldn't before: not the book itself being good, but rather, **routine**. I've made a habit of reading for about an hour every day for the last two and a half months I've been going through the Dune series. The actual amount of time varies based on the chapters, but following this methodology has ensured that I have made my way through these books without feeling burnt out too early.

I wonder how many people here have had similar issues like this, where books were something they hadn't considered reading before but have found a way in which consuming them becomes a rather simple process. I've only been reading properly again for the last two and a half months, and I have an unfortunate habit of dropping routines if I don't stick to them for long enough, but if I keep at it and keep on reading, then that can only be a good thing.

At the very least, I'm not short on stuff to read once I'm done with the Dune books. :P

**TL;DR:** I thought I didn't like reading and didn't stick with anything I tried to read for a decade, until I decided to check out 'Dune', and made my way through four of the Dune books in over two months by dedicating an hour a day to reading. Something finally clicked in me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wqoav4/a_few_months_ago_i_thought_i_didnt_enjoy/,2022-08-17T12:56:17Z,13,39,books,Me Before You,POST

de1gh9,The sheer emotion Dune made me feel(Spoilers for the first 270 pages of the first Dune book),"So I last week I decided to buy Dune and read it. I heard lots of great things about it. 

So I was reading the part where a drugged Duke Leto is brought in front of the Baron, knowing of the fake tooth with the poison in it. After witnessing poor Yueh’s death I wanted some proper revenge. 

I was reading the book in bed, before the breaking of the tooth, when sudenly I felt really thirsty. I got up to get a glass of water, and that’s when I realized I was literraly shaking with emotion. My feet felt weak and trembeling, my hands were twitching. 

Never before had a book(or movie) had that effect on me. I was amazed by the sheer emotion it made me feel, the same adrenaline rush you get after going on a rollercoaster ride. I am typing this out a few minutes after, still in awe

amzvuk,"I am currently reading Ulysses and it's got me thinking about books you ought to read, and the sunken costs fallacy","I'm currently reading Ulysses. This is not the first attempt, but it is certainly the furthest attempt. I am currently at 30% read (I am reading it as an ebook).

Considering Ulysses is considered one of the most important works of the 20th century l feel it is a great book to read, a great book to be able to say you have read and for someone who considers reading a hobby it is a great challenge, akin to tackling a marathon if you are a runner.

However, even with the background info, the chapter notes (I am reading the overviews and analysis for each chapter, before and after reading that chapter) I am struggling to really make sense of what is happening and why it is so revered.

Ulysses is certainly a momentous work when you consider modernism and the technical aspects of stream of consciousness that Joyce pioneered, I had the opportunity to study sections of it at university, which was when I first attempted to get through it, and I recognize its significance. Now that I have gotten through a third I feel like this is it, this is the time I finish it... But then there is that old adage I'm not sure where I heard, or who said, that states

 ""Life is too short to read bad books""

I'm not saying Ulysses is bad, but it is certainly difficult to call it enjoyable. Much like a marathon, it is a painful challenge I want to have done, but, apparently, don't want to do as much as I thought I did.

Where do you stand on powering through a book for the ""cultural capital"" of having read it, if you are not particularly enjoying it? Any other book of a similar length but without the acclaim I would have given up, but I know that in my life I would like to read ulysses and considering how far I am this time I feel like this is it, but is this just the sunken costs fallacy?

c2ln0u,The thing that's bugging me about The Book of Air and Shadows,"
How sexist does a book have to be before you’ll drop it right then and there?  I was reading The Book of Air and Shadows by Michael Gruber, and I had something happen to me that hadn’t happened before, and I’m wondering if I’m alone.  I bet I’m not.

*mild spoilers*

To set the scene:  two people work together in a rare book shop, the man is a young-ish computer guy who works in the basement, the woman is a young, frowny, leave-me-alone type who works the showroom.  Things happen, they are forced by circumstances to spend a few days at her apartment fixing a water-damaged book which requires the drying papers to be changed every two hours from between each page.  The job obviously requires two people.  OK, I’m buying it.  At one point in the narrative, the man comes into the bedroom to wake the woman for her shift.  Instead of waking her immediately, he’s struck by the innocence of her demeanor, and hesitates.  He then proceeds to peek under the covers to see what she’s wearing, and then he takes a finger and touches her panties.  That’s all.  No fondling, nothing else.  He wakes her immediately after that.  
But this tiny touch was enough to make me scream HELL NO, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? This seemingly tiny incident, which has no relevance to the plot or character development (so far), is enough to piss me off so mightily that I might not get through a book which I think might actually be good.
So here’s the question I ask myself:  Is this bullshit just part of writing where the author doesn’t “get” women, and I should just slog through an otherwise very good book, with the understanding that for some writers, they will never understand the opposite sex?  Or are these tiny micro-aggressions that have been hiding in plain sight forever, and my bullshit meter is on full charge and I HAVE HAD ENOUGH.
This book wasn’t written in the high-flying 70s or the good-ole-boys 80’s.  It was written in 2006.  And I haven’t been quietly sitting around reading “fiction lite” for decades.  I consider myself a well-read and  critical reader.  I read The Handmaid’s Tale when it first came out.  I’m all about #MeToo and #TimesUp and I believed Anita Hill the minute she opened her mouth because out of it came Truth (I’m looking at you, Clarence Thomas.)  
How much sexist bullshit do you put up with when you’re reading?  And the answer isn’t zero, because that would be too limiting.  I don’t expect every author to be perfect, there wouldn’t be anything out there to read.  But what have you come across that was too much for you?  I’m talking about straws, the tiny things that piled up until suddenly one word makes you quit a series (If Robert Jordan had Nynaeve al'Meara tug on that damn braid one more time…)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c2ln0u/the_thing_thats_bugging_me_about_the_book_of_air/,2019-06-19T19:41:56Z,2,4,books,Me Before You,POST
10hx8n2,"BETWEEN TWO FIRES - by Christopher Buehlman. A medieval horror novel about the Black Death, the Church in crisis, Apocalypse, and forgiveness. My first full read of 2023, and it gutted me.","When I first heard comparisons to Berserk, Bloodborne, A Song of Ice and Fire, and other grim-dark fantasy horror, I was sold immediately, especially if it meant supporting a self-publishing author. What I expected was what I got - brutal and broken characters (all of whom are likable and believable beyond belief) and the trauma through which they suffer, a look into the bleakness of Europe in the throes of the bubonic plague and the wars that wracked the continent, gripping action, tragic figures, and coming face to face with incomprehensible and otherworldly horrors from the most esoteric bowels of Hell itself as well as angels of Heaven, as terrible as they are beautiful. I also got what I did not expect - the kind of humor that can emerge only from the greatest despair, summoning only the best kind of laughter - the kind that heals. LGBTQ/MLM representation that is as heartwarming and believable as it is horribly tragic, painting an unforgiving picture of the cruelty of the past. A story that, while by all accounts would probably be called blasphemous by a more devout man, teaches a lesson in faith, forgiveness, letting go of the past, redemption, and God’s love that I had never expected to be so poignant from a book like this. 

What else it has going for it:
-amazing descriptive writing, some of the more elaborate, surreal, otherworldly ways of describing the indescribable. It is able to put into words something beyond the understanding of the human mind while still conveying the point that these are only the words that a frantic mind can find to make sense of what is being shown. The way the book eases the reader into filling those blanks in through context clues and looks into the inner monologues of our protagonists is masterful. 

-one of the most undoubtedly horrifying depictions of Hell ever concocted by the human mind. True despair in the most literal sense of the word. 

-lovable and believable characters. The book is able to use these players to switch seamlessly between some of the most believable, funny, blunt, and real dialogue to some of the most poetically written passages I’ve ever had the pleasure of finding. This includes the way that the story intersperses the narration with the thoughts of characters to give a sense of the scene’s urgency, the character’s doubts, etc. 

What I didn’t care for:
-I found one or two parts formulaic in the most minor sense of the word. It did not take away from my enjoyment or surprise of the story at all, and I felt that even if the story was able to make obvious the direction it was going in, the way that it used it’s own writing style, narration, flashbacks, and other tricks to supplement these story beats made them just as impactful as they would have been if you didn’t know where they may lead. In fact, it almost seemed to make the direction that these plot points lead into that much better (I’m specifically thinking of Dune “spoiling” what is to come in the story to set up certain expectations for readers in order to toy with them later). 

Over all, this story ripped my heart out, covered it in gravel, put a stake through it, put it back in my chest, ripped it out again, and then somehow managed to put it back in once again stronger than it was before. This book made me want to be a better, stronger, more forgiving person.

I’m sure everyone’s had panics before- that’s normal, but the way Green captured the enveloping, hopeless nature in the middle of an attack, how your thoughts become your dictator and you the helpless fool- that’s what stuck out to me the most. 

Not gonna venture into spoiler territory (the attacks are common early on in the book), but his pacing of the attacks was especially powerful, I think, and was a wonderful insight if anyone hadn’t experienced a full anxiety attack (or many) before. I’ve only had a few myself in the past, but still was able to feel a small click, though of course I don’t understand completely Aza’s situation. 

I also started this book tonight. A little under 3 hours ago. It’s a little under 300 pages, so for a quick, emotional (I’m still distraught lol), impactful read, please check out ‘Turtles All the Way Down.’ Wonderful insight into why you might not always be able to get through to someone with mental illness. That alone I think makes it worth the read, this empathy factor, because, though you only really hear about the bad, I can still see parts of the world becoming more understanding, and this novel may be able to aid in furthering empathy and understanding for anyone willing.

Thanks, this is my first post here. I really hope I didn’t break any rules, but truly do I recommend this.

6a1xpl,"Beginning The Brothers Karamazov, anyone have any advice for me?","I decided to finally start the book I've had on my reading list since I was a sophomore in high school. My history teacher gave a soapbox speech about it to us, concluding that if we wanted to know ourselves we should read The Brothers Karamazov. Years went by and I ended up taking 3 years of Russian language and culture classes in college, but never found the time for Dostoevsky. More years went by and now that I'm done with my masters, pulled out the paperback copy I bought close to 10 years ago and am ready to begin. As added incentive, my girlfriend has agreed to begin her own treacherous, long put-off book, House of Leaves, if I get through this. I'm a librarian now, so a man's gotta do what he's gotta do to get his fellow dudes to read.

I thought I'd submit a thread asking my book friends for any tips, strategies, or general advice they might have for me before I get started. I've been exposed to Russian lit and its language before, so I totally understand that nickname conventions and the huge cast of characters are hard to grasp at first, but I think I'll be okay in that regard. I suppose what I'm asking is also more for you to share your thoughts and supply some insights, or point to accompanying material/literature that can enhance the read for me. Really anything to motivate me even more to embark on this journey is appreciated. I want book hype, I want sources that provide literary context, I want someone to say, ""Hey, take it from me, you should draft up a character web to help you navigate through the story,"" or, ""Eat some borscht and embrace your inner east Slavic.""

What it comes down to is I'm excited and want everyone else to be excited. Not for me, but because there are great books out there, prolific books that can mean so much to someone despite having never read the work before. Books that carry so much clout with them that just opening up the cover can fills us with an unparalleled giddy anticipation for the journey about to unfold. I'm raving, perhaps emotionally off-kilter. Whatever. I hope everyone can enjoy a nice book tonight, and thanks in advance for anything you end up sharing.

3q7nxz,Could someone discuss John Steinbeck's East of Eden with me?,"I've never really felt like this before, I'm only 17 and I really haven't read for fun in a long time. We just finished *Of Mice and Men* in my english class and I thought it was fantastic. On my English Teacher's reccomandation, I picked up a copy of *East of Eden*. Over this weekend I was completely sucked into the book, I read nearly non stop and I finished it just 10 minutes ago. 

I'm not really sure how to describe how exactly I feel right now... I can't even put into words what exactly I liked about the book. All I know is that it is by far the best book I've ever read. I'd really love to just... discuss it and to just hear about what other people thought about it. I searched on this sub and on the internet before posting this and I just can't seem to find what I'm looking for. I'd really just love to hear anyone else's thoughts on this piece by Steinbeck. 

I feel like, being so young, and reading it so quickly I missed out on a lot of subtle things Steinbeck was saying. Is there any sort of video or article I can read that will go further in depth and analyze the book? I don't know what I'm looking for but I'd love to discuss this with some of you.

kq33rf,Child of the Dark: The Diary - twos days bad and changed me,"Anyome read the Child of the Dark: The Diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus?

I am curious to see the opnion from someone that read the english version
And also to share my thoughts

I read the original and I got bad for two days. 
In a good way. My eyes changed I see people that I never saw before. People that I never laid attention. I changed for good

The book was a pain to read and I continue. 
First strange thing happend.
I never did this before, I avoid suffering at all costs. I am watching korean dramas because is not so explicit violence.

I know life is not easy. But this book holds me on a thight grip. I read the book in two or three days at most.


I got a little bit crazy but other day I was thinking how I am going to disposal my garbage in a way I can help. 
I got furious when my apartment building put locks on the garbage bean
How is the people going to get the valuable garbage? 
All cans and cardboards I put outside the trashcan.
After some weeks I received a message on the apartment group that the locker for the trashcan was broken. And I got happy ( sorry)



The second bad day(about to finish the book I think) . As I leave my apartment. I saw a street guy collecting garbage out of the can and I give all my money in the wallet ( not much). 
Almost cried. I even dare to think "" how is the coincidence to find this guy just as I am reading the book"" and I cursed myself. You see people like this everyday but you don't ""see"" then

I remembered his name. 

Over the course of some days not so distant.
I encounter him again and greeting him
I encounter him again and I greeting again.
I bought sugar cane juice and I bring to him. 


He thanks and he finds difficult to remember me. 
I know he could be memories problem. Also there is so many invisible people in his life. Why all the sudden one bastard(me) decides to remember him. But I remember and I will probably never forget

We have a small talk and I go my way.


Since the book is about street collectors I cannot see one and think how his life was. 


I cannot change the world. But my charity money from now on goes direct on their hands. 

Anyway, I talked with friends, girlfriend but I didn't find anyone that read as well. 
I am not expecting to find and I am not recommending the book. Not because is not good but I don't know what to think in open the eyes of someone else so brutal. 

If you asked my before person explaining the book, I would not read for any reason on my life. But curiosity and I didn't read about. 

Do you read the ""abouts book""? Because if I earn a book, usually I just start to read and complete ignore what the book is about. 
I cannot avoid this complete but I get my fair chance of read mind blow boks that I wouldn't. 


Thanks for reading.sorry for all mistakes.

lgpgt4,"Songs that make me think of Normal People, by Sally Rooney","Hey so these two songs remind me a lot of Normal People, by Sally Rooney, and I was wondering if you guys maybe agree :)

**Cardigan by Taylor Swift**

*""And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed, you put me on and said I was your favorite""*

In the book, the first time Connell tells Marianne he loves her, it says that “She has never believed herself fit to be loved by any person. But now she has a new life, of which this is the first moment, and even after many years have passed she will still think: Yes, that was it, the beginning of my life”

""*Vintage tee, brand new phone""*

Their Socioeconomic differences: Connell is the vintage tee and Marianne is a brand new phone.

*""High heels on cobblestones... Sequin smile, black lipstick Sensual politics""*

Classic Marianne: ""came to college and got pretty"".

*""When you are young they assume you know nothing""*

Everyone from Marianne's life had looked down on her at the beginning. Even though she was the smartest student (other than Connell), her family and high school classmates continued to belittle and mock her.

""*A friend to all is a friend to none. Chase two girls, lose the one.""*

Connell was always popular in high school, but he later says that he never ""clicked"" with any of them. He was in a relationship with Marianne for months and then proceeded to ask Rachel to the dance, which was the last straw for Marianne.

*""To kiss in cars and downtown bars was all we needed""*

That perfect point in their lives during college before they broke up because of their inability to effectively communicate with each other.

*""Leaving like a father,""*

Connell's dad hasn't been a part of his life.

*""Chasing shadows in the grocery line""*

When Marianne comes back home and they unexpectedly meet in the grocery store

**Strawberry Blonde by Mitski**

Okay, honestly only some of the lyrics of this song really make me think of Marianne and Connell's relationship, but I think the song works better thematically. The melody is kind of Gaelic and reminds me of rolling hills in a small town in Ireland. I imagine the song coming from Marrianne's perspective at different moments in their relationship.

*""When you stood up, walked away barefoot, and the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape, I looked over it and I ached""*

Connell, in the beginning, continued to walk away from her making her feel like there was no place in his life for her, but still the imprint of his life on her's remained (and obviously vise versa, but I'm thinking from Marianne's perspective).

*""I don't need the city and I don't need the proof. All I need darling is a life in your shape, I picture it, soft, and I ache""*

Connell never proved to her when they were young that he loved her. She let him ignore her at school, because she loved him, but not herself. When he didn't invite her to the dance we see how much she truly craved to be a real part of his life, but he never let her.

*""Look at you strawberry blonde.""*

Connell isn't strawberry blonde, but to me it's more of the idea of seeing someone as perfect: Although she outwardly rejected the idea of conforming to her peers expectations of ""normal"", this didn't come from a place of self assuredness, rather it was a defense mechanism to keep herself from getting hurt (""reject them, before they can reject you"" mentality). She really wanted to be loved and accepted, but didn't think she was good enough. She longed to be a part of his ""strawberry blonde"" world.

Then in the second part of the song I think about that time when they were in college.

*""Reach out the car window, trying to hold the wind.""*

Marianne feels like she is trying to hold the wind every time they get back together only to break up. Their relationship is ungraspable and unstoppable, it couldn't be contained. It came and went like the wind.

*""You tell me you love her, I give you a grin. All I ever wanted was a life in your shape, so I follow the white lines, follow the white lines, keep my eyes on the road as I ache""*

Connell tells her that he loves Helen, and it breaks her heart, but she won't step out of line to reclaim him in any way. She just grins and lets her heart break.

&#x200B;

Yep that's it!

Full Disclosure: I didn't know where to put this, so if you have a better place, let me know

94aih0,Can someone help me understand something with regards to an author's feelings about his book?,"Forewarning, this is going to be very confusing because I've had a tough time articulating my thoughts.

Okay, so I just got done reading The Book Thief - great story by the way -, and at the end there is a Q and A with Zusak. One of the questions asks him who he thinks the MC's greatest friend is, and he replies with Rudy, additionally noting:

>Rudy is just my favorite character. From the moment he painted himself black and became Jesse Owens, he was my favorite. Liesel kissing his dusty, bomb-hit lips was probably the most devastating part of the book for me to write... I was a mess.

I don't understand a few things here. (beware, this is going to sound stupid). One, when he says something like ""from the moment he painted himself black..."", it just feels like he's acting like a reader watching the story unfold - dude, *you* made the guy paint himself black and probably knew you were going to put that into the story a while before you even got to that chapter. And two... the whole ""devastation"" part confuses me. It just seems like he's acting like he had no choice or decision crafting the outcome of the character - almost like it *had* to happen that way. Like, no one forced you to do that. *You're* the author after all.

So I guess what I'm getting at is, authors essentially play ""god"" in their stories because they get to decide everything that goes on, but do they sometimes make ""sacrifices"" (as in, insert ideas or events in the book that perhaps go counter to what they actually want to happen) to make things more dramatic or enhance meaning?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/94aih0/can_someone_help_me_understand_something_with/,2018-08-03T15:25:43Z,8,2,books,Me Before You,POST
gzkqg3,This Book that helped me to pass a tough phase of my life.," **How to Stop Worrying and Start Living** by Dale Carnegie

This book is my recent favorite as it was from my favorite author.

Some books are worth keeping on your desk all the time, that they teach you something new every time you read them.

As the title suggests, this book teaches you how to stop wasting your time by thinking about your past and worrying about something that long gone.

It has taught me many valuable things, some of them are as follows:

1. One of the worst features of worrying is that it destroys our ability to concentrate.
2. Have no anxiety for tomorrow, have no thought for tomorrow. - Jesus Christ
3. The most relaxing recreating forces are healthy religion, sleep, music, and laughter.
4. Never have leisure times, it brings evil thoughts.
5. The law of averages says that 99% of what you fear does not happen. (*The teacher you dread the most when you’ve not done the homework, he/she won’t show up to the class. :D*)
6. Analyze and criticize yourself before someone does that in a harsh way.
7. A wise man walks away from a fight instead of staying and fighting.
8. When you are good to others, you are best to yourselves - Benjamin Frankin
9. God created you and all your actions! - Koran
10. If you hit the bottom, just stand there and relax. There is no place to go now, but up!

&#x200B;

This book surely helps you if you’re struggling to get over from your past.

And my poetry to protect me*

My girlfriend whispered in my ear, “That’s you.”
And then when they sang those lyrics, it hit me so profoundly, I had to fight back the tears.

Hiding in my room, safe within my womb

I am an island

And a rock feels no pain

bbxtc1,Just finished reading Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door yesterday. It still messed me up...,"Probably the second time I feel messed up this year (after cristchurch shooting), and I still can't get rid of that feeling, so I write this to share some reasons why it messes me up:

For one thing, it's like that [SPOILER](#s ""Junko Furuta murder""). Just not only being told to you, but makes you feel like you're watching the whole tragedy before you and nothing you can do to stop it, unless you stop reading ofc which only means you stop watching.

Worse thing is that it's told from David's POV. Teenage boy who just hit puberty with his curiousity for sex, his feeling towards Megan, his loyalty to his best friend, his courage to change things and his powerlessness.

Another worse thing is, _IMO_ it's so well written. How Megan is introduced and portrayed make me feel insurmountable sympathy for what happened to her. And no matter how frustated I am with some David's choices, Jack ketchum always presented good reasons for those choices, so in the end, I just thought that those are probably the best David could think and do. [SPOILER](#s ""And how Ruth written as villain with mental illness made me feel genuinely conflicted, how can I hold this much grudge towards someone who was mentally sick after her husband left her with 3 kids and at least 2 of them psychotic"").

Yet another worse thing, and probably the worst, is it's based on true story. I just can comprehend how [SPOILER](#s ""a middle aged woman with helps from her kids and whole kids in town were capable of doing such things with little to no consciences"").

Probably one of the best books I'll never read again...",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bbxtc1/just_finished_reading_jack_ketchums_the_girl_next/,2019-04-11T09:31:08Z,3,8,books,Me Before You,POST

My mom says I loved reading before learning the letters, I would pick up kids magazines and create a whole story based on the pictures. She rarely read to me.

A student transferred to our school and after talking for a while she recommended (angels and demons) by Dan Brown and lend me a copy which I spent the whole day reading. It's been almost ten years since then, but I still remember her from time to time for introducing me to his books, even tho we didn't become friends and I don't like the books as much now.

I remember this because I just ended a relationship that lasted only a month after being friends for about 7 months. He introduced me to The Name Of The Wind which I liked very much, and I finally got into fantasy, after putting it for long, because of him.

I feel like books recommended by other people hold a special place for that person even if we don't see/talk to each other anymore. And I love that.

I love that a piece of me will always stays with people I knew during my life.

The blurb; Lou Clark is back in the ALL NEW Jojo Moyes novel Still Me, follow-up to the Number One international bestsellers Me Before You and After You. Read the first chapter here! Lou Clark knows too many things . . . She knows how many miles lie between her new home in New York and her new boyfriend Sam in London. She knows her employer is a good man and she knows his wife is keeping a secret from him. What Lou doesn’t know is she’s about to meet someone who’s going to turn her whole life upside down. Because Josh will remind her so much of a man she used to know that it’ll hurt. Lou won’t know what to do next, but she knows that whatever she chooses is going to change everything.
I absolutely love Jojo Moyes’ books, she writes in a way that gently pulls you in without you even realising, then by the end of the first chapter you know you’re completely hooked.

I’ve only read the first chapter of Still Me but already I feel as if I’ve met up with an old friend – Lou Clark – and can’t wait to see what’s next for her.

The story begins with Lou arriving in New York, about to start a new job as a companion to ‘a rich mans wife who gets depressed’.

I’m looking forward to reading about life with the Gopnik family and the adventures Lou will have on Fifth Avenue New York.

The only trouble with reading the first chapter of Still Me is that now I have to wait until 25th January 2018 to read the rest of the book.

5mme38,Writing has made me a WORSE reader,"I have heard it said that the more you read, the better you write, and my experience has been largely consistent with this maxim. However, in recent months I've found that the complimentary idea is not true: I feel that my writing has made me a *worse* reader. Let me elaborate.

I remember a time, not reliant upon youth or naivety, when I had little trouble sinking into that blessed immersion of altered reality we lovingly experience whilst reading. Be it fiction or non fiction, within a few paragraphs of a well (or even adeptly) written words, I was completely enraptured by its purpose, never breaking my mental engagement to consider reality or practicality. If you frequent this subreddit then you know exactly the phenomenon I describe. It is the mark of successful writing and aspiration of every budding writer.

And yet, as I grow in my personal experience of writing original material (that is to say, the more I am forced to create my own narrative through diligent practice), I find that aforementioned submersion into a book eludes me. Now, before you decry my supposed problem as rooted in arrogance and superiority, hold fast. 

It seems that as I consume line after line of paragraphs pages and volumes, I find myself pausing at unbearable intervals, stuttering and stammering gravely as I consider the author as he penned the words I now read. I am forced to consider how I might have communicated the same thought or event, and often find my mind roaming so listlessly that I can scarcely see the ink for the story. It is my flawed insight into the process of writing and editing which conspires to rob me of my enjoyment of quality writing.

Now, undoubtedly I become a more rounded writer as I dissect others' writing, it would be impossible not to. And yet I miss the days when I hadn't seen the proverbial man behind the curtain, when I could bask in awe and stupid enjoyment of another's hard work.

My idea is that you create an account, and either select a list of books you want to read, or import a list from goodreads.com or some other set.  You then set a budget (e.g., $20 / month) and the website will use some sorting algorithm to buy a book for you.  If a book costs $40, then it will wait one month and then purchase the book the next month.

Another add-on to the program could be notification to an e-mail account / smart phone, so it will say for example ""These three picks are available for you, which would you like"" and the program would then purchase the one you select.

I'd love to hear your thoughts, and please feel free to tell me this is a terrible idea.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/md7eq/give_me_your_budgets_and_books_you_want_and_ill/,2011-11-15T16:33:04Z,4,1,books,Me Before You,POST
3r8bk1,"Hi! I’m thriller writer Jack Soren, author of THE MONARCH and THE TOMORROW HEIST – Ask me anything!","Hi everyone! I’m Jack Soren, internationally published thriller writer, Netflix addict, and cheeseburger connoisseur. I’m the author of THE MONARCH, book #1 in my debut thriller series. THE TOMORROW HEIST, book #2 hits e-readers tomorrow.

THE MONARCH was mostly written during a Nanowrimo a few years ago and I sold it to Harpercollins without an agent (yes, it is still possible!).

I live in Toronto. Before becoming a thriller novelist, I wrote software manuals, drove a cab and spent six months as a really terrible private investigator.

THE MONARCH was nominated for the Kobo Emerging Writer national book award and the Silver Falchion Reader's Choice Award.

I’m thrilled to be doing my first AMA! I’ll be here today answering questions from 3:00pm until 4:00pm Eastern Time.

Proof it's me: [Jack Soren Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/jacksorenwrites/).

Thanks for spending some time with me this afternoon! Now, go ahead, ask me anything! =)

Edit: Thanks for hanging out with me this afternoon, everyone.  I had a blast!  I'll check back  tonight for any questions from stragglers and answer them the best I can.  I'm looking forward to doing this again in the future.

7fnltq,"As a Late-30’s American Male, Here’s the Novels I’ve Read Which Have Stuck With Me (Long)","This is a long one.  As anyone in their late 30s who’s been a lifelong reader can say, I’ve read a lot of books.  This list is just about novels, so forget about any non-fiction up front.  I went in thinking this might be a long list (maybe it’s a lot of writing for a Reddit post), but as I finished it, I realized it’s not really that long.  These are the books that, as I have thought about and written this post, have stuck out.  For about 3 decades of reading, I wouldn’t say this is a monster list.  There are plenty of other books I’ve read and liked, but I’m focusing here on those who have left some “special” impression in my mind.

This is in as close to chronological order as I can make it.

THE THINGS I’VE READ WHICH HAVE LEFT A LASTING AND POSITIVE IMPRESSION:


1.  “Catcher With a Glass Arm,” by Matt Christopher.  I read this book, over and over, in approximately 1986-1987.  I was maybe 8 to 9 years old.  It was given to me as a gift from my aunt.  I’ve read a summary of it to refresh my memory of what it’s about, but any reason I give now for why it has left such a positive impression on me will be tainted.  The reality is I can’t remember.  I remember loving the book, and being excited by it.  Not the most interesting explanation to start off, I know, but I’m trying to be as honest as I can with this list.  Also, I know this isn't a novel, but it's fiction and was an important book for me at such a young age.

2.  “My Brother Sam is Dead,” by James Lincoln Collier.  I read this book in approximately 1988, and I would have been about 10 years old.  This is probably one of the first “novels” I read.  I was somehow connected with it through school, but I can’t remember if I just got it in the school library or had to read it for a class.  I remember (probably more of an impression now) laying on the bed in my early-childhood bedroom, reading this book and just being taken away emotionally by the story.  I remember telling my mom about how good it was.  I have always remembered the title and at least part of the premise (war, etc.), but I haven’t re-read it in adulthood.  Out of curiosity, at some point in the last year I looked it up and learned it had even been nominated for a National Book Award.  Apparently, it’s also been a frequently-challenged book.  Nothing in particular about it sticks out to me as memorably violent or otherwise, and I can’t remember now if that’s how I felt back then.  I only remember that I really loved this book, and that’s it’s left a lasting impression on me, and to be honest, probably played a major part in my lifelong love of reading.

3.  “Ender’s Game,” by Orson Scott Card.  I was about 12 years old when I read this, in around 1990.  I’ve read it many times since.  I just felt that I related so much to Ender’s social situation, because I was starting to get at that age when you really notice different social circles forming, etc. and I was going through my own experiences with the cruelty of children.  Also, I just loved the story and the page-turning suspense.  I guess just like anyone else who read this book and loved it.

4.  “Streams of Silver,” by R.A. Salvatore.  Kind of a memory gap here, which really means the books between the last one and this one didn’t leave an impression, or that my timeline is screwed up (possible).  I read this around 1991, and would have been about 13 years old.  I can’t remember for sure how I got my hands on it, but it might have been given to me by my older sister’s boyfriends at the time to read.  It’s not even the first book in the trilogy, and I doubt I knew that at the time.  I remember just being swept away by the fantasy elements of the story, feeling page-turning suspense, and falling completely in love with The Forgotten Realms Books, and I guess I’m cheating a little here, but I’ll just allow this one number to encompass all of the Realms books I read for the next four or so years.  I don’t know how many that is, but it’s a lot.  R.A. Salvatore has always been my favorite of the many authors that wrote those books, but that whole phase of my reading life has left a huge impression on me, and definitely made me a reader for life.  I’ve gone back and re-read many of them, although I don’t read as much fantasy these days.  This genre basically puts me up through high school and into college.

5.  “Night,” by Elie Wiesel.  I read this in about 1999, when I was in my second year of college.  (I was a little older though.  After one year I dropped out for 2, then went back).  I was about 21 years old.  I’m sure I was reading between high school and this point, but maybe only a little.  This part of my life is more heavily associated with music than books.  Also, as much as I loved reading, I was always reluctant to read class-assigned books, no matter their merit, and I often didn’t do it.  I don’t know why I was like that, given how much I love to read, but I was, and so frankly I put myself quite behind in having read many “classics” and probably also set myself behind in having a basic foundation for understanding literature.  “Night” was just heartbreaking.  I still vividly remember specific scenes from the book.  I won’t go into them here, because I’d rather simply recommend this book to anyone, regardless of what genre(s) you like to read.  It is a book I would consider “mandatory” reading for any adult who wants to think of themselves as a well-rounded person.  Actually I’d recommend it for others, too.  Just any adult who can read, should read this book.  This was a book that was assigned to me in a literature class, and I’d grown up enough by then (and the class was an elective) to read what I was told to read.  My professor had timed the class reading with an appearance and speech by Elie Wiesel at my university (which was a genius move, and let us all know who was actually coming to speak).  I was lucky enough to be at the speech and dinner afterward, and it was an experience I’ll remember for the rest of my life.  So.  Read “Night” if you haven’t.  It’s even a quick read, even for a slow reader like me.

6.  “The Stranger,” by Albert Camus.  I read this in about 2003, during college, about 21 or 22 years old.  This one wasn’t assigned to me by a class.  I was a philosophy major during college, and I started to get more interested in broadening my literature interests around the same time I was introduced to existentialism.  The ideas I learned in college definitely shaped who I am today (although I can feel that my views since then have sometimes changed), and when I discovered that there were philosophers who wrote literature, I was automatically interested.  So I call this my “Camus Phase.”  I read The Stranger maybe 3 times, I read The Plague, and a bunch of other Camus (actually, I read all of his novels, but none of his other short stories and none of his non-fiction that I can remember).  I specifically remember just laying on my back, staring up at my dorm ceiling after finishing The Stranger, and being amazed that such a book existed.  This is the time when I started to pay more attention to language, and to deeper ideas in books than just the plot.  I still don’t have a great understanding of the ideas underlying “deep” books, but I think about it now.  This started with Camus, and I remember liking The Stranger the best.

7.  “Invisible Man,” by Ralph Ellison.  I also read this in about 2003, and it was assigned for a class.  Man, this book is intense.  I remember thinking at the time it was long.  I was feeling pressure to keep up with the assigned readings of it for class, in part because I’m such a slow reader.  I did love this book though, and still have my college copy (I sold back many, many books, because college, and broke).  I haven’t re-read it, but I probably will at some point.  At any rate, I had to keep it.  Just seeing it on my bookshelf brings me back to specific scenes in this book.  I remember thinking that prior to reading this I had no real perspective on being African American, and thinking after I’d read it that at least I was aware I had no real perspective on being African American.  This book did nothing less than shape my entire world view.  I am convinced that literature is the best way to show others how the world is for you, and forgive me the political opinion (I said it shaped my world view), but this book convinced me that if you don’t read literature, it’s questionable whether you are qualified to lead in a political role.  Literature, like Ralph Ellison’s novel, has taught me that we must dialog with each other and approach each other with the knowledge that the world is a different place for everyone.  Without that starting premise, we’ll always fall into the traps of simply believing that other people don’t have any common sense, are simply stupid, or are basely criminal.

8.  “Angels and Demons,” by Dan Brown.  That’s right.  Dan Brown.  This was around 2003, I’m about 25 years old.  I’m in grad school at this point.  I didn’t read many novels in grad school because I wasn’t studying literature and I was just too busy.  I borrowed this from a classmate who recommended it as an entertaining and quick read.  I read it in a weekend, which for me, is amazing.  At this point I was just looking for a guilty and hopefully quick read to give my brain a rest, and this novel hit the spot.  It also broke a sort-of spell I had put on myself telling myself I should only read “high brow” novels.  This has left a positive impression on me because it was a memorable and fun read, and I associate it with a change in perspective allowing me to feel more open with myself about just reading anything I thought looked good.

9.  “The Satanic Verses,” by Salman Rushdie.  I read this one around the same time as Angels and Demons, and they’re the two novels I remember positively from my time in grad school.  This was the first time I had read language like this.  Salman Rushdie’s writing is so unique and powerful, and the plot!  I remember thinking what struck me was that these extraordinary things were happening and everyone just acted like it was normal.  I read more on the internet about those ideas and learned I was thinking about magical realism.  This book made me a huge fan of the genre, but did more than that.  The kind of writing Salman Rushdie does in this book changed my idea of what a novel could be.  It was like he didn’t follow any of the traditional rules or formulas that I could recognize.

10.  “Midnight’s Children,” by Salman Rushdie.  I was going to include this with the last post for concision, but that’s really not fair to this book.  It deserves it’s own spot on my list of specials for Reddit.  I’m out of grad school at this point, and it’s maybe 2005.  In fact, I can place it specifically at summer, 2005.  Just out of grad school, studying for licensure exams, and spending any free moment reading this awesome book.  It’s thick, and I’ve only read it once, but I want to read it again, because I can’t remember the story almost any at all.  That’s odd to me, but I remember loving it and thinking literature would never be the same (just like after The Satanic Verses - seeing a pattern?)  I’m sure it’s deeper than I can recognize, but the language, the characters, the plot, I remember loving it all.

11.  “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,” by James Joyce.  This was 2005, right after I finished grad school.  I read it during a vacation in Florida, and I remember loving the language, but it is too thick for me to have completely understood.  I’ve been afraid to tackle any more Joyce since then, but this small book is a really great one.  Maybe someday I’ll get the courage to open more Joyce.  If you want to experience his writing, though, I’d recommend this as a good starting point.  It’s left a lasting impression on me specifically because of the beauty of his writing.

12.  “Interview With the Vampire,” by Anne Rice.  I read maybe the first four of The Vampire Chronicles right in a row.  I had gotten a box set of maybe those four.  I had already seen the movie, but really enjoyed all of these books.  They were well-written, placed in interesting times, and were easy to read.  Lots of fun.

13.  “The Road,” by Cormac McCarthy.  This was maybe 2006.  I was about 28 years old.  I lived alone in a small town I moved to for my first job after school, and spent a lot of time reading.  I read this in a weekend, and it just devastated me.  It’s such a great book.  I’ve recommended it many times over the years, but I’ve honestly been surprised how many people started it and didn’t like it so they stopped, or read the entire thing and told me they didn’t like it.  People how do you not like this book?  It makes you feel real emotions.  By putting words on pages.  Real, actual body-response emotions.  That’s magic.  McCarthy’s writing was (and still is) so cool to me.  It’s much different, of course, than Salman Rushdie’s, but I put them in the same category in my mind.  If I could write 1/4 as good as either of these guys I’d be a genius.  I remember thinking how odd it was that you never got inside the heads of McCarthy’s characters.  Later, when I read “Child of God” I remember being struck by this even more.  You had to just watch these characters do things without having any perspective as to why.  It’s still such a unique way to approach writing, and McCarthy is the master.

14.  “Gravity’s Rainbow,” by Thomas Pynchon.  It’s true.  I struggled through this, but I did finish it.  It was around 2006 as well.  This novel is unlike any other I’ve ever read, and if you feel you’re up for the challenge I say give it a shot.  I won’t even pretend I understood even a fraction of its references, and that’s OK to me.  It was written with incredible language and I love the paranoid, Alice-down-the-rabbithole feel of the entire thing.  There are so many memorable scenes in this book, even for those of us who can’t understand it all.  In fact, I was so enthralled by it that I started a little collection of different printings and copies of this book.  I also have “Pictures Showing What Happens on Each Page of Thomas Pynchon’s Novel Gravity’s Rainbow,” by Zak Smith, and a companion reader I can’t remember the name of right now.  I’ve read other Pynchon novels too:  “The Crying of Lot 49” and “V” in particular.  I started Vineland but didn’t finish it.  Really liked V, and I thought Lot 49 was good but not great.

15.  “A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,” by Dave Eggers.  Read this in about 2006, soon after grad school.  I was about 28.  Maybe it’s cheating to call this a novel since it’s autobiographical, but I think it counts.  This is a book that, to me, is just like the title says.  But it’s another that, like The Road, I’ve been suprised by the number of people who’ve read it and didn’t like it.  All I can say is I just don’t have that perspective at all.  This book left a huge impression on me.  I remember thinking Eggers was a genius (still do) and that his voice was so developed and moving.  I still recommend this book to anyone.

16.  “The Naked and the Dead,” by Normal Mailer.  This is the only Norman Mailer I’ve read so far, but I really loved it.  This was also about 2006.  I don’t remember many specifics from the plot, but a few memorable scenes still stick out.  It’s another one I want to read again.  I think I could get a lot more out of it now than when I read it.

17.  “Beloved,” by Toni Morrison.  I think of this as one I probably should have read before 2008, which is about when I read it.  I was about 30 years old.  Wow.  Toni Morrison.  What a writer.  You know I’ve learned my experiences with “famous” books can vary from the public opinion, but all in all I’ve found the jury of public opinion to be pretty spot-on when it comes to what constitutes timeless, wonderful literature.  This book is like that.  When I finally read it, I knew instantly why it had such a reputation, and why Toni Morrison is a genius.  This book instantly left an impression on me, and I remember asking myself why I had waited so long to experience this amazing story.

18.  “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” by Douglas Adams.  I read this about 2008 too.  I hadn’t read it before, by this point I’d seen the movie.  I loved this book.  It’s so full of humor and insight and it’s so witty.  This is a great read, but I wouldn’t think to recommend it to just anyone.  I feel like it might be one of those “you’ll know it if you see it” situations.  If you think it looks interesting, then you’ll probably love it.  If you know a little something about it and aren’t intrigued, you probably won’t.

19.  “2666,” by Roberto Bolano.  I read this book in about 2008 as well.  I don’t want to spoil anything, but for those of you who’ve read it, I remember just sitting in my chair reading that one chapter with just graphic description after graphic description and thinking, my goodness this is powerful.  It’s a really dense and amazing story, and it had me completely enthralled.  This book is dark, but very powerful and an amazing read.

20.  “The Story of Edgar Sawtelle,” by David Wroblewski.  I read this novel in maybe 2012.  I was about 34 or 35 years old.  This novel just drew me in.  I loved the story and felt very emotional when it was over.  Many scenes from this book have kept a prominent place in my memory, and I’d recommend to almost anyone.  Has Wroblewski written anything else yet?

21.  “The Kite Runner,” by Khaled Hosseini.  This book I read around 2012 as well.  I don’t remember the entire storyline (I do remember some of it), but it left a remarkably positive impression on me anyway.  I haven’t read anymore of Hosseini yet, but it’s on my list.  I remember reading this book on the front porch of my house and just having to stop, put it on my lap, and think about what I was reading.  The language is beautiful.  I’d recommend this book to anyone at all.

22.  “Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West,” by Cormac McCarthy.  I initially started to feel like I was cheating you all by re-listing some authors, but that can’t be the case since I’m being honest.  I read this about 2012 or so too.  By this time I had read The Road and Child of God, and decided to tackle this one.  Boy am I glad I did.  This is one of my favorite novels of all time.  It’s so violent and mysterious, and the entire idea of the character of Judge Holden is fascinating because of how McCarthy used him in the story.  This book isn’t for everyone (it’s quite violent, so if that isn’t your thing, be forewarned), but it’s a masterpiece.  It’s one of those books I feel like I could always be reading, over and over, along with anything else I happen to be reading at the time, and very few books have made me feel that way (Gravity’s Rainbow might be the other).

23.  “Everything is Illuminated,” by Jonathan Safran Foer.  This book I read about 2013, and I was maybe 35.  It’s a fun read.  I can understand why there’s some controversy surrounding whether Safran Foer is a “great American writer,” but the truth is I really like his writing (I’ve also read Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close” but not his newest novel, yet).  I know there are traces of some cliche to it and all that, but there’s no denying he knows how to put an entertaining story down on paper.  Again, this is a book I can recommend to anyone.

24.  “American Pastoral,” by Philip Roth.  I read this about 2013 too.  This book is so good and the story is so powerful.  I read this and knew why Philip Roth is Philip Roth.  It’s not a book for everyone, but for anyone who likes some literature that you can really think about, it’s a good one.

25.  “The Corrections,” by Jonathan Franzen.  I read this about 2013 too.  This book made me a Franzen fan (I’ve since read “Freedom” which I also thought was very good, and some of his essays).  I thought the story was so funny and touching.  I tried to get my wife to read this but she just couldn’t get into it, so I guess it’s not for everyone, but honestly I can’t understand why.

26.  “The Pillars of the Earth,” by Ken Follett.  I read this about 2013.  Man this is a page-turning, awesome read.  I think the story is so compelling, and this book has one of the best villains I’ve ever read.  It’s an easy one to recommend to anyone.  It’s not too “deep,” it’s entertaining, and it’s a can’t-put-down type of read.

27.  “All the Light We Cannot See,” by Anthony Doerr.  I read this in 2014.  About 36 years old.  This is such a powerful novel, and I enjoyed every bit of it.  The language is beautiful, the story is beautiful and eye-opening, and it’s left an amazing impression on me.  It’s touching and sad and I could go on and on, but I’ll just say read it.

So those are the books that, right this moment, I’d say have left the biggest impressions on me.  I’ve obviously read a lot more than these, but this is a pretty solid list of amazing books in my mind.

ulc63i,I just finished reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and it was a bit of a mixed bag for me.,"Title. I'd heard of the book (and both the Swedish and Hollywood movie versions) before and a couple weeks ago, having run out of reading material, I decided to give it a shot. Overall, I enjoyed it: The characters were fleshed out and intriguing (Lisbeth Salander in particular I'd heard described before as ""wicked smart"" and she definitely lives up to it), the plot and overarching themes were well-executed, the mystery at the centre of it all was captivating and well-crafted, and the book does a good job of conveying the dark, sinister tone and atmosphere that everything is set in.

On the other hand though, I have some rather large hang-ups regarding the general writing style and pacing. Some of the choices of words in the lines of dialogue felt a bit stiff and clunky, but I can cut some slack there since I know the book was originally written in Swedish and no translation is perfect. However, another thing I found that I couldn't get past as easily was that often times, it felt as though the book got completely sidetracked giving the backstories of characters or describing some historical event, the setting of a scene, what a person was wearing or eating, or a sequence of events leading up to a scene. Most of the details provided in these instances were, in my opinion, largely irrelevant to the plot and character progression, or could've at least been conveyed in a more concise manner. I actually like stuff that's a bit wordier and more detailed, but that preference only goes so far. If a story is being wordy and detailed without actually moving things forward and keeping the relevant parts of the story in mind while doing so, then it just feels bogged down to me, and that was definitely the case with this book.

As well, going back to the dialogue, it felt somewhat dry in many places. I get that a good number of the characters are generally more reserved and stoic in demeanor (especially Lisbeth), but the book often had long runs of back-and-forth dialogue that weren't broken up by actions, expressions, gestures, or really much else that could've helped to paint a picture of how the characters were reacting or feeling or what they were thinking in the moment. As is, there were parts that just felt like the scene was being played out by a bunch of talking heads rather than living, breathing characters.

Finally, the back half of the book, in my opinion, suffered from the climax being reached too early (yes, I know: phrasing). The whole sequence with them solving the mystery, Lisbeth saving Mikael's life, and Martin's death was definitely the emotional height of the story as a climax should be, but the part with discovering that Harriet was still alive and her returning to Sweden felt more like a proper follow-up and denouement than what the book actually ended up providing. I feel like the final section about Mikael restoring his reputation and Lisbeth deciding how she feels about her relationship with him still needed to exist, mind you; it wrapped up the story's plot and character threads well, but the fact that it occupied what felt like an entire third of the book after the major conflict had been resolved made it seem more akin to a very extended epilogue rather than the natural ending of things.

Ultimately, like I said, I enjoyed reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and felt it was good, but the writing style and pacing were done in ways that kept me from truly loving it. I'm unsure whether or not I'll read the rest of the trilogy, but the Swedish and Hollywood film adaptations are definitely on my list of movies to watch now. I'm rather intrigued to see what they do to potentially address the problems I've outlined, if anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ulc63i/i_just_finished_reading_the_girl_with_the_dragon/,2022-05-08T21:52:17Z,13,8,books,Me Before You,POST
is5cn8,Not what I bargained for but it is now something that defines me to the core...,"I love travelling and exploring different places and cultures. I attribute my love for travelling to Enid Blyton's The Famous Five books that I used to read in grade school. Enid's description of the different adventures the famous five went on drove me to a goal of wanting to explore a world beyond my immediate surroundings, and motivated me to work hard in school to secure a scholarship to study overseas. I didn't make it overseas but I got a scholarship  to study locally... I have been travelling ever since. And it all started with a trip to the library looking for a book to occupy me during the school holidays.

bxt2s4,My Great Uncle left me some Books before he died.,"Please let this be the right sub.


He died a few years ago but I only found time now  to unpack the books and have a little read.

The oldest book is from 1937. Its called ""Der Admiral"" and was written by Eberhard Wolfgang Möller. It has ""only"" 54 Pages.
But before I could even start reading I found a little note in it that says: In true Companionship your Friend Heinz. It is signed by his Friend (I imagine). And has the Year 1939 (Christmas) left to it. So this was in World War II. It is quite Hard to read since it is written in Deutscheschrift.


Then there are 3 Books written by Janusz Meissner. 

-Das Grüne Tor   (The Green Door)

-Die Schwarze Flagge (The Black Flag)

-Die Roten Kreuze ( Red Crosses)

They were written in 1963 and are absolutly Beautiful. I can write a Summary if you want.

The rest of the ""Books"" are shortstories and are written by a Variety of Authors from GDR and USSR. The Time they were written in vary from 1953 to 1989.

68snvb,Raymond Carver short stories are hard to understand for me...,"Hi everybody! I started reading Raymond Carver short stories, specifically _Where I am Calling From_ collection.

I have read amazing insights from this author and his short stories, and for me, it was a new genre I am wanted to get into. However, I am having a hard time trying to gasp the meaning behind the stories because most of the time I find them rather cryptic and usually I dont know what is going on.

When I finish one story I usually have a big ? Over my head, and have to look for some analysis online in order to understand it, and it has been like that for all the stories I have read so far, I have been enjoying  much more the analysis than the story itself.

What am I missing here? Should I probably read some other subgenre of short stories maybe from some other collection of Raymond Carver that is not that hard to understand before attempting this specific collection? Or look for another author?

I would really appreciate your comments and feedbacks or maybe personal experiences regading this issue. Thank you so much to alll of you!

98zgjs,"I read, but most books don't make me feel amazed me","So, after a life of not reading books at all, two years ago I decided to start reading, by today I've read a total of 48 books, and even tho I'm glad I've started reading I feel like I might not be getting what I was hoping for

My first book was ""Gone Girl"" and I've gotta say I loved it, or at least the first half of it. It was thrilling, intriguing and entertaining, I loved the writing style, specially the diary bits, heck I remember I even had dreams about the story wanting to know what happened with Amy, then the second part of the story came and it felt a little plain, I kinda lost interest in the story, I finished it and felt like ""It was okay"", but I loved so much the first part that I decided I loved the book overall

That motivated me to continue reading, and even though I enjoyed the books I've read I'm always left with a ""plain"" feeling (I don't know if I'm expressing myself properly because English is not my mother language, but I think you get it), I end up with a feeling of ""That's it?"", Besides Gone Girl another book that hooked me was Shutter Island

I mean, I've read awesome books, for example I know ""Brothers Karamazov"", ""It"", ""The Shining""  are good stories, I think of the moment when I read those and I think ""These are good"" but it's my lack of emotions while reading what makes me write this, I should be feeling emotions while reading, no? Instead I feel like I'm advancing a story and that's it, like when you read something for school, you just go through it and remember the information but that's it

Maybe is the way I'm reading? Should I use more my ""imagination""? How? Is the problem the books I'm picking and I just haven't found my cup of tea? Has anyone else felt something like this?

I think I went deeper than expected, but I hope someone in here can give me a recommendation

1bbtwwx,"Fade to black/low spice MF romance between doctor-patient/ caretaker-patient like Me Before You, 50/50","Just saw Joseph Gordon Levitt's 50-50 and it brought all the feels back from Me Before You. 

Looking for a book where either MC is a sick patient and the other MC is a doctor/caretaker/therapist and they fall for each other in a really sweet way(I realise it's extremely unprofessional 😂 but hey it's fiction) 

 No smut please. I'd like a cute well developed relationship if possible 

 
I was just rooting for Anna Kendricks character to get together with JGL's and I squealed when it happened. 

Bonus if the FMC is quirky, weird, adorable and ends up embarrassing themselves like Anna Kendricks in 50/50 and Emilia Clarke's character in Me Before you. (P.s. I've read the Me Before you book/s ages ago) 

It doesn't have to be that the MMC is ill and the FMC is the doctor/caretaker, if can be switched.

I've actually searched doctor-patient tropes before but always end up with really spicy, open door content which I'm not looking for. 

So TIA :) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1bbtwwx/fade_to_blacklow_spice_mf_romance_between/,2024-03-11T03:44:51Z,1,5,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
q96glg,Question about Me Before You,"TW sexual assault 

I’m reading me before you, and there was a part where the MC talk about the day she stopped being fearless. She mentions that at one point when she is young she is out with female friends and some out of town guys but suddenly her female friends are all gone. It does a small time jump where her sister comes and finds her. 

To those who have read this, did you interpret that as her being simply abandoned by her friends or as her being sexually assaulted by the guys? My first thought was assault, as it would make sense with her general discomfort around people and intense dip in confidence, but I want to know if that was my more pessimistic outlook on reading.

Edit: ok, I just need to be more patient.

Edit 2: *spoilers*
I’ve just finished reading where Lou tells Will about her experience in the maze, and I wish the author had called it what it was. So often I feel like authors are quick to use tragic backstories to create character depth, but when it comes to actually addressing those experiences they shy away from the reality. I wish Lou had straight up said “I was raped in that maze.” That would remove any ability for more resistant readers to say “oh she was just a little harassed,” and it would give her a strong voice regarding the issue. 

Sure, including it in your story is representation, but the fact that the main character doesn’t even use the word for it just feels like it’s further pushing the idea that this isn’t something that should be openly discussed. I mean the FMC clearly feels ashamed of talking about it to anyone, and her boyfriend has already shamed her for it too. I’m hoping there are some good conversations in the later chapters that really tie Wills positive response and Lous finally being able to open up together into a more pleasant message. Right now this book is more problematic than not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/q96glg/question_about_me_before_you/,2021-10-16T06:29:26Z,10,17,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
jebtni,Curious: Angsty books sort of in the same category as Me Before You.,"I was looking at the description of Abby Jimenez new book (possible ALS diagnosis in the synopsis) and my brain somehow went to Me Before You. It's been a few years since I read it but I realize I've bumped into nothing even sort of like it since? Well that's not entirely true. I've read a few YA books that could fit in somewhere along the same lines.   


Anyway I'm wondering if there's anything sort of like this out there. I'm okay with hidden spoilers. Actually if there's a death I would prefer a hidden spoiler.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/jebtni/curious_angsty_books_sort_of_in_the_same_category/,2020-10-19T21:57:05Z,8,4,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
th0z1r,Tell me your experience of how romance novel change you to become a better person. Or realize the value you hold before was completely bullshit…,"Ok… I guess because I am the one who put up this question, I think I should go first. 

I lived in an Asian value household. We value tradition while also excepted the world is changing and we need to adapt. I alway thought to myself that I am a progressive person in a way. I love my country value such as: loyalty, hardworking and try to be your best, while excepting people no matter their race, gender or life experience.

And as a result, I grew up reading old Asian romance novel. Where the woman are usually kind, sweet, do no wrong and mostly a Mary Sue. Whether she was described as sassy, strong, or icy cold, she has to be virginal and do no wrong. If another woman who like sex, dress pretty, love fashion, don’t like to work on desk job, that woman has to be a lazy, slutty, evil step sisterof the FMC or a love rival who worship the ML to the point of ruining her life for it. 

And for a long time I carried that thought to myself. I get wrap up in an ideal of a “ perfect “ woman that I secretly judged other woman for it. I alway said that I am ok with woman having previous relationships, yet I told myself I will never have many flings like them. I distance from woman who extroverted, pretty and  outgoing just because I think they may have a nasty thought for me. 

That is all change untill I found this sub, and read my first English novel that you guy recommendedfor me. I was put off immediately with the FML introduced to me. She sweet and kind, the “ type” of character I would like. Yet she fail at many relationship, not a virgin and struggle with her feeling.

I was immediately put off by the book. Return it and say I am not going to read smth like that again. Yes for a simple bullshit reason that the female lead is not a virgin. 

I look for another book on the sub, but multiple books just hold completely value to my “ideal woman” . The number then grew too large, too much to ignore, and I soon realized if I kept this mindset, I am just gonna leave out multiple great book for such a small detail. So I close my eye, pretending that I don’t the detail I don’t like and just try to focus on the storyline .

First book : Still don’t like it, but their relationship is respectful, so that is sweet

Second book : Ok I get why she make so many wrong choices in her previous relationship, but in the end she learn a lesson and grow as a character. I can appreciate that

Third book: I get it now, these flings before shape her the woman she is now, so I as a reader should not hold that against her…

Fourth book: Yo yo man… Calm down, she just done with you… She give you a chance and not attracted to u. Dont call her a slut just because you guy don’t work out….

Each book, each character, each motivation, I learn something new. I encounter great female character and awful female character. Picking out things need to be criticized and praised from the same FML. Slowly but gradually, I learn to view a character not on some bullshit, outdated female value but as a value of a good, unique and awesome character. Yeah, it doesn’t matter what type of relationship the woman has, hold different view than me, as long as that woman is a good person and an awesome character… Why should I care about that ?

I also learn to put the ML, who previously just a brooding, handsome eye candy for the reader under the same magnifying glass as well.

And when my Kindle is filled up, I started to reflect more and I realized how much of an asshole I was. I started to smile more, show my feeling better, not judging people for small and unimportant thing, talk and compliments other female friend who like more girly stuff then me ( who r really nice and sweet to me).

And this not just only me. The Eastern romance scene also change. Many authors also put these issues out, criticized them and try to put new value to the old market. 

I am not gonna lie, I still got lot to learn and more to improve. But I really appreciate this sub for the wonderful books you recommended. For many comments tell me your opinions and view of different subject. To show me how to reflect myself and improve myself. I really appreciate you guy and I will try to be the best I can. 

But now the post is long, so I want to here your story, your journey. How you change big or small. I think this will be an interesting thread for others to see. Because there are no judging. No one will judge of trying to become a better person. It eveb become motovation for other in their time of need…",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/th0z1r/tell_me_your_experience_of_how_romance_novel/,2022-03-18T13:10:02Z,15,75,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST

rrlhze,"Please recommend me romance books where they say ""I love you"" before they jump into bed","I'd say 90% of the books I've read seem to be the other way around (10% of which are series that start off as YA). There's nothing wrong with jumping into bed before you've sorted out your feelings of course, but I've just read too many of these already. It's strange how common this is even in HR books, which again is probably 75% of the romance books I've read. Or maybe this isn't strange at all; it probably takes less time to squeeze in a quick fuck than go and fall in love with a whole man, all in the time it takes for your chaperone to get back from the powder room. 

I'm not a big contemporary romance fan unless it's more women's fiction like Beach Read. Preference for Historical Romance, although I'm reading The Hidden Legacy series and thoroughly enjoying it, so Fantasy is good to go also. 

My only requirement is that both FMC and MMC say (or show, but preferably say) they love each other. I guess they can also imply that they love the other?

You were right.   I can tell this book is never going to leave me.   My heart, my mind,my sleep is already in tatters.   I’m mad at everyone in this book at different times and my HEART can’t take it.   
This is it.   This is the one after Land of the Beautiful Dead that is forever gutting me.   That one gutted me at 91%.   This one has been doing it from about 6%.    I want to scream at the characters.   
I want to call out from work.    How can I be expected to go in when much bigger things are happening in my book?   It’s so bleak and can only get worse at this point.    I don’t even know where I am but I guess around 70-80%.   

So thank you for real.  This is the one.   Well potentially the 3.    I’m literally counting down to my lunch break to get more in.   

My personal life right now is an actual disaster with my son.   I’m devastated for him.  It is the worst thing to watch your kid go through something so horrible and feel so helpless.    He is in an impossible situation and I can do NOTHING to help him other than watch and support.

Other woman shenanigans. It's like ordering a dessert and getting served a tiny, bitter pill instead.😒

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not opposed to a good dose of drama in my reading material. Bring on the love triangles, the betrayals, the heartbreaks, I can't get enough all that angst!  But puhlease make it worth my while. Give me a full-length novel where I can sink my teeth into the juicy drama, where I have time to get invested in the characters and their messy lives.

Angsty novellas are just..too...short. 😭I want depth, complexity, and enough pages to properly unpack all that drama. So, excuse me if I'm not jumping for joy at the prospect of squeezing all that emotional turmoil into a couple dozen pages.

Give me the full story, the epic saga, the literary marathon. Save the soap opera for the big leagues, where there's room to breathe and room for the drama to unfold. Because life's too short for mini melodramas, and I've got better things to do than waste my time on a novella that leaves me wanting more... of everything but the angst.

I’m looking for a recommendation from any category except reverse harem (will accept poly MMF) or omega verse - with characters who have a love that is soft and intimate and gentle. 

I’m thinking of a romance along the lines of Radiance or Master of Crows by Grace Draven. Maybe even something like Preferential Treatment by Heather Guerre or Halfling by SE Wendel, where the sex is spicy but the dynamic underneath is just soo soft and tender. I’m just looking for a lot of intimate scenes that don’t necessarily need to involve sex, like the hair brushing scenes in the aforementioned Grace Draven’s books, scenes of comfort (like the sick scene from Preferential Treatment omg), lots of cuddling etc. 

I think I’d especially enjoy a friends to lovers or marriage of convenience/arranged marriage trope with a gentle slow burn. Maybe even grumpy/sunshine with a grump who just completely melts. Hurt/comfort/angst welcome as well as long as the angst is not directly between the characters, but rather them working through angst 💘

I really value beautiful writing and mature characters. Characters 23+ preferred, or at least written in a way where I can pretend they’re older in my head lol. Please no pregnancy as well sorryy :)

Fantasy is my favorite genre but I’m open to anything, including sci fi, CR, and possibly even historical fiction. Will also take queer book recs but M/F is my preferred :)

I’ve also read damn near 250 romance books in the last 2 years so the less commonly recommended the better, I feel like I’m running out of things to read LOL.

Yes it is a SLOOOOOOW burn, but the tension release is 🔥

Yes it is obvious that MZ is paid by the page-turn. Facts are uttered 2-3 times.

Yes the MMC is kind of dick at the beginning. I almost DNF because he was so terrible.

I am a sucker for a sweet, straightforward MMC POV. I would pay an NFL salary for a retelling from Aiden's POV. Anyone else with me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/18wqx05/the_wall_of_winnipeg_and_me_by_mariana_zapata/,2024-01-02T14:39:43Z,35,79,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST

17ikobh,Please Help Me Understand What *Slow Burn* Actually Means,"I've seen the term used to describe various different types of books, with various different types of storylines.

There's the Mariana Zapata variety of slowburn, where the MCs aren't in any sort of relationship and you get to see them slowly develop closeness, attraction, feelings culminating in a love confession, and potentially sex at the end. 

There's the Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold/Marriage of Convenience variety, where there's a relationship that starts at the beginning, with/without sex, and then the relationship slowly deepens and intensifies.

There's the Mary Balogh formula where there's a sexual encounter in the first half of the book, and the the MCs pine over each other and develop feelings before the HEA ensues.

And lots of other books I've seen described as 'Slow Burn'

Does slowburn necessarily mean there's simmering sexual tension and pining? 

Does it mean that it takes time for the MCs to develop feelings/get into a relationship? 

Is it more about the pacing of the story?

11n1myf,Suggest me a book that is OVERWHELMINGLY sweet,"I am looking for your recommendations for books that have overwhelmed you with sweetness. I'm talking about books with quotes that have literally had you closing your eyes and giving a mental scream, they are so lovely and precious.

I know this is truly more of a vibe than an actual request. Here are some example books and quotes that have made me feel this way before:

Marrying Winterborne by Lisa Kleypas

>!“Try to leave me, and see what happens. Go to France, go anywhere, and see how long it takes for me to reach you. Not five fucking minutes.” He took a few vehement breaths, his gaze locked on hers. “I love you. I don’t give a damn if your father is the devil himself. I’d let you stab a knife in my heart if it pleased you, and I’d lie there loving you until my last breath.”!!<

Keturah and Lord Death by Martine Leavitt

j297is,💪 r/Romancebooks has made me a (better) feminist,"# r/Romancebooks has made me a better feminist, and it’s about time I thanked you all for it.

# ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍

# [TDLR; Thank you, to each and every one of you. ](https://images.app.goo.gl/qFP8E67YhhqLMd4W8)

Hiya everyone, u/PenelopeSummer here 👋

Kinda embarrassing appreciation post comin’ up.

(So.. wut? How did a romance sub where half the front page is usually infested with recommendation requests accomplish this? 👀)

Ok well before I explain, this probably isn’t going to be the most sophisticated or well worded post. I’m kinda at a loss for words really, and I couldn’t make this organized and coherent even if I tried. But I’ll try not to get too sappy and stick to facts (and less emojis).

&#x200B;

**Before I found this sub....**

Yes. Of course I believed in feminist principals, feminist ideologies, and tried my best to to act accordingly to them, before ever even coming here. Yet I was very underdeveloped, had weak spots, and was not fully realized.

&#x200B;

**And then I found this sub...**

🌈 And an unbelievable miracle started taking place.

Gradually, spending more and more time on here, it’s like all those feminist ideologies and principles that I *knew* all about, were in the process of being nurtured and coming to *life*. Something which I’d never come close to experiencing before discovering this sub.

Because all said and done, textbook knowledge and knowing you should act a certain way because you wish to bring about a change, is totally different from *embodying something,* and *feeling it pumping in your veins.* It’s a way of being that you don’t even realize is possible, until it just clicks.

&#x200B;

**How did this happen?...**

I’m not sure how this happened (or actually, how it is happening) but it has me in surprise, wonder, and amazement.

Sure we have plenty of conversations which are directly related to feminism. But that’s not the only thing which I’m talking about here.

&#x200B;

**So what am I talking about?...**

So you wanna know something crazy? Your feminist ideals and empowering belief systems have managed to reach me through random things which are (seemingly) unrelated to feminism.

Through book discussions, random opinions, off topic conversations, funny jokes, silly rants, the really shitty shit posts, even the recommendation request infestations, all technically having nothing to do with feminism. Maybe it’s the way you articulate yourselves. Maybe it’s the unconditionally accepting, supportive, and encouraging environment you all foster, no matter where we are in our journeys or what we enjoy. I know it probably helps very much that this sub has none of the toxic bitterness that one could find on other feminist subs. It leads by joyful inspiration and gentle example, not by force or imposition of beliefs.

But basically to all of you here:

Who You Are and What You Stand For really shines through your words, as unrelated as those words may be to feminism at that given moment... (and you people need to know that about yourselves. 🥰)

You’ve gradually infiltrated through my inherent thought processes and outlook on life for the better, simply by being You, and talking You.

&#x200B;

**And I’m talking about each of you**

I’m not just talking about a group of members, or the regular participators. I’m being completely and totally honest when I say that when I started becoming more observant, I was noticing that even the unrelated comments from random lurkers were making a positive impact on me. No exaggeration. I couldn’t begin to list the different users who have unknowingly and indirectly touched me. I think to comments of specific users who probably don’t even know me. So if you’re reading this, I’m speaking to you, one on one.

I’ve learned a lot from the incredibly strong women (and supportive men) here. You guys are like my big sisters/siblings, even those of you who are younger than me 💕

Because in all honestly, feminism is something I wasn’t aware I’d been struggling with my entire life until this sub. And that’s a pretty dramatic impact to have on an individual’s life.

One day I came away from the environment of this sub and into the real world and thought, “Is this really how things have been working around here? Is this what people accept as normal?”

And this was a magnanimous shift in me, for someone who has never really felt “feminist enough” and deep deep deep deep down could never bring myself to this space of deservability due to blind spots and mental blocks.

Does anyone else here ever feel that distinct difference between this sub and outside of it? Does anyone else feel like they can be a better feminist for the world simply after being infused with the empowering, progressive, positive energy of this sub?

&#x200B;

**What made me realize the changes in myself...**

How did I come to know of these subtle changes in myself? It happened through small realizations on a day to day basis.

Maybe a situation would happen where I would realize that I (surprisingly) really wasn’t ok with something. That I was angry, even. I would become *aware* of the fact that what I wasn’t ok with was perhaps a product of sexism. And most importantly, I would truly feel it, not just “know” it.

More distinctly, I would come to realize it with media and entertainment I’d been consuming. Good, well accepted, “decent” movies for example. The sad truth is that there is objectification of women everywhere, and for the most part it’s accepted as “normal” and harmless. And examining myself, at one point I *kinda* thought it was harmless too. Without realizing, I had accepted this behavior, thinking that this was “just a part of life.” Thinking it was an overreaction.

But once positive shifts started taking place within me due to the influence of this sub, for the first time in my life, my inner being *revolted* against even the subtle instances of objectification of women, not willing to tolerate it. The strains of these new feelings started emerging in me. (And I kinda started feeling really proud of myself too 🙈) because this was something I’d been trying to achieve, and it has now become a naturally occurring thought process for me thanks to this sub.

To be honest, I had always been in awe of women who could be perceptive towards very subtle forms of sexism, and admired their ability to call it out with no hesitation. For me, I think I had subconsciously resigned myself to the fact that I’d only ever be able to demonstrate “learned” feminism, but never reach these heights of conviction in my belief. And this sub is changing that.

&#x200B;

**And you know, this sub has helped me improve with regards to all kinds of issues.**

My family has been biracial for some generations now, and that was something I’d always felt strong and sturdy in, but this sub managed to improve me even further in that regard. And, even though I was brought up to be unconditionally supportive and encouraging of all queer culture, I do not have direct personal experience with being queer, so romances have given me the chance to be in the shoes of people of all sexualities.

But... feminism was a weak spot for me. Maybe due to certain early on experiences that paved the way for harmful conditioning. I’m still young, kinda impressionable, and nowhere near perfect, but the changes are taking place now. Thank you r/Romancebooks. 💖

&#x200B;

# Has anyone else felt that this sub positively shifted their outlook or belief about anything, even minimally? Be it racial diversity, LGBTQ positivity, feminism, body positivity, self acceptance, mental health, etc? This is judgment free zone about whatever your old belief systems were, or whatever current beliefs you are struggling with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**It’s a wrap folks.**

Reading this over, this is an embarrassingly sappy, off topic, TMI post which I’d originally wanted to make from a throwaway, but I didn’t want to anyone figuring out it was me using a throwaway. So maybe, delete this from your memory if you wish to save me the acute shyness and embarrassment. 😅

And whoever read all this word vomit, you da real MVP. 🥇 I just needed a space to get it out really.

&#x200B;

**Warning: I might be late getting back to any replies if there are any, because I’ve a been a bit tied up lately. But thanks so much for commenting, even if you didn’t actually read the post (which is totally understandable)**

PS...

I love all of you ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

wr20vm,"Can folks who have read the inimitable Draco Malfoy and the Moritfying Ordeal of Being in Love have a ""dis-gush-ion"" with me about how freaking wonderful this story is?","I have no romance-reader friends IRL.  You guys are my happy place.  I have recently finished this incredible fanfic, and I need an outlet for all the wonder in my soul.  We can talk about anything related to this beautiful story.  I mean, my God--I've barely read any fanfics really (this was my second), and the plot, writing style/voice, and development of two full-bodied characters in heart-melting , life-altering *freaking* LOVE easily put this story in the 95th percentile of all the romance I've read in my lifetime.  I AM AFLUTTER.

Here are some parts/lines I loved:

\--the competency kink . . . I love how Draco mooned over how capable Granger was (exploding inkwells), and *I* mooned over his badass Auror-y (counterpoised to his complete ignorance of most things Muggle)

\--their deliciously oblivious idiocy regarding their feelings, Amortentia potion and all 

\--heart-shaped sunglasses

\--their tour of the Malfoy rose gardens, especially this description:  >!""The sweet paralysis was coming over him again, of not wanting to move, of lightness in his veins, of limbs feeling weightless and eyelids feeling heavy. He wanted to put his chin where her neck met her shoulder and just stand there. He wanted to say things in her ear and feel her shiver against him. He wanted to linger here, being stupid about kiwi, for an age or two. He wanted to float.""!<

\--nuns

\-->!""Tell your cat I said pspsps."" !<

And so, so much more.  But I want to hear what you all loved too.  I feel immensely grateful that I found this story thanks to a few posts on this sub yet simultaneously gut-wrenchingly woeful that I'll never get to read it for the first time again.

sx57d7,Lemonade by Nina Pennacchi has changed me forever,"(This may contain spoilers and some taboo subjects, please keep this in mind before proceeding)

Since childhood, I've always been more attracted to sexy and naturally domineering (using the word natural because i don't want it to be confused with the ultimate alpha bros, if I make any sense) hero pursuing his lady by cornering her, placing his hands on either sides of her to not let escape, and confess that he loves her or say that she loves him too. If the hero is just too sexy, I liked it if he forced the heroine to give him a chance (Note: I hated this when a villain did it, somehow when a good looking hero did, I was fine)

I also liked slightly unhinged anti-heroes who were absolutely obsessed with the female lead, even though, in most of the films I've watched, they almost always died.

As I've ventured into fanfictions, I've always read stories featuring rough sex, obsessed lover, and MMC exuding the absolute masculinity.  

In short, I enjoy MMC's who are domineering, crazily in love, and maybe a little bit alpha. Soon, I've been exposed to ""forced"" trope and I enjoyed almost everything about it. Since I've read too many mafia fictions as a teenager, I blamed them for igniting somewhat a darker side of the spectrum that I might have liked since childhood.

When I discovered this sub and explored various genres, I came across Lemonade by Nina Pennacchi and casually started reading it. I fell in love with the book shortly after at just around 10%. The scene in the library where Christopher corners Anna? That's right up my alley of my favourite MMCs. However, my excitement didn't last long for the book turned extremely dark immediately after; the rape scene was truly the most graphic depiction of any non con I've read in my life. I had to keep my phone down, take a deep breath, watch a nice song, and continue. I couldn't brush past the shock and the tears while reading that segment of the book. Soon, I finished the book. The book ended abruptly and I still loved every part of it. 

I love how I loved Anna. I loved how I hated Christopher. I loved how I questioned myself when I found myself hating him a little less. I absolutely love everything about the book.

Now, I am not able to move on from Lemonade at all! It's concerning me. I've never been so hung up over a book before. I've never reread anything so obsessively before. I recognise that Lemonade ticks off everything that I like:

✓Dark

✓Non-mafia

✓FMC marrying MMC unwillingly

✓FMC truly being repulsed by MMC

✓MMC being domineering

This could be why I am not able to move on. 

I do have some problems with the book like I sometimes wonder why Anna didn't confess that Christopher raped her to Daniel, sure he wouldn't have let her marry him. But then I don't understand why she rejected Daniel in the first place. Let me just stop here before I continue to ramble about what I don't like about the book.

Back to the point, I'm worried. I don't know if something is wrong with me for liking and rereading a book like this. I have tried reading more non con, assuming maybe the graphic non con surprised me and that could be why I'm reading the book all over again, but I just couldn't do that. I don't have a problem with non con, so the other books I've read, they've been a nice read but they didn't move me at all. 

I don't have anyone to share this turmoil with because I just can't tell anyone IRL that I read non con and like it when FMC is absolutely cornered. 

Did anyone of you face this with any book before? How did you move on? 

I'm sorry if this isn't appropriate. I'm also sorry for the very long post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/sx57d7/lemonade_by_nina_pennacchi_has_changed_me_forever/,2022-02-20T16:37:07Z,77,110,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
l8ka2v,"this sub has never let me down, i need a slow burn (enemies to) friends to lovers where we see the first meeting","my favorite trope is probably enemies to friends to lovers but i know that’s very hard to find lol, they don’t HAVE to be enemies it’s just a bonus for me at this point. i NEEED it to be a slow burn too, from both sides so i don’t want the guy to have been pining for the girl for years or anything, i want them to fall slowly in love with each other. my favorites are when the H and h become best friends and kinda toe the line between a relationship and a friendship with the jealousy, the touching and what not. i don’t like childhood best friends tropes, or books where they’re already best friends before the book starts. i’ve also read all mariana zapata books and i personally don’t like HR. i knooow i sound so picky but i’m desperate, if you could suggest anything for me i’ll owe you 

i liked;
the deal (a favorite) 
the wall of winnipeg and me (a favorite)
beard science (love love love this one, a favorite)
the friend zone by kristen callihan (i need exactly that but a slower burn)
josh and hazels guide to not dating (it was nice but wouldn’t call it a favorite)

i disliked:
a girl like you (writing fell flat for me)
before jamaica lane (they were best friends before the book started)
from lukov with love (checked all the boxes but mc was annoying)

I also thought {It Happened One Summer by Tessa Bailey} was fine, but didn't particularly like it that much. I've struggled with her writing in the past, especially her sex scenes and dirty talk which I found cringy and jarring. These 2 books still had sex and dirty talk, they just felt like it matched the characters, they weren't too over the top and they didn't take me out of the story. I'm not opposed to explicit sex or dirty talk at all, I just want them to match the characters and not seem to be completely out of the blue. 

I've tried other Tessa Bailey books in the past that were really not for me. I dnfed {Getaway Girl by Tessa Bailey} after the first sex scene and {Fix Her Up by Tessa Bailey} I dnfed even before the first sex scene since I just hated the writing and what was happening in that book. 

Anyway, I really enjoyed Hook, Line and Sinker and I'm wondering whether that was a fluke or maybe she has more books that I would like.

Okay, *okay*, I'll stop evangelizing. It's obvious I love this book. The real question is, will *you?* I can't promise that - but l can give you all the tools you need to decide:

❶ **The biggest tool you need: Carter Beckett.** First and foremost, it's *The Carter Show*, and he owns the stage. If you're charmed by him, you'll love it. If he's not your cup of tea, this book won't be.

He is... adorably arrogant. Basically, imagine if Gaston was reincarnated into a Golden Retriever puppy. (You'll understand when you see the quotes at the end of this review.)

198mix6,Take Me With You by Nina G Jones,"I feel like when this was recommended I thought it would be unnecessarily gross and demented, in a way that wouldn’t compliment the story and stay true to the characters. But let me tell you, easily one of my TOP 3 ever!! 

The characters do change but in a natural way, that still flows with the story line and they both really just get more demented, no traditional redemption arc. Super well written, in a way that is harder to find in some romances, very articulate and calculated in its own right. The level of suspense is perfect, the twists and surprises are well done, and the author doesn’t allow the story to be too predictable until she tells you it can be. Genuinely, genuinely, hats off to Nina G Jones.

The way that you see the transformation of Vesper to someone perfect for Sam is truly enrapturing! The mirror of their lives, and their inverses and compliments, I know the author said this isn’t a romance but the kind of passion in this book is truly like no other, in ways that I’ve never read before. I don’t gasp and get up to walk around my room to just any book but this book did it for me!! 

If you listen to the true crime type podcast because they fascinate you, and you like aggressive romances, and I mean DEMENTED this is the romance for you.

1ajmfrh,Help me find: A story where enemy MMC saved FMC and takes care of her,"Hi, 

This is my first time posting here so I hope I'm doing this correctly. I have searched a bit but could not find anything like this that has been posted before. I am looking for a book/story where the MMC is fighting in a war as a soldier (preferably higher rank) for the ""enemy"" side. The FMC is from the other side and is part of the victims but MMC saves her and takes her as a sort of ""war trophy"" and takes care of her in a very kind and loving way. To the outside world (his fellow soldiers) he makes it look like he is treating her badly so they won't suspect anything but in reality he takes good care of her. 

Can be main plotline or part of a plot.

yw2y7d,Hear me out…Megamind…?,"For anyone that hasn’t watched it before you should. But I’m more interested in the romantic aspect of it. 

A quick summary of it is basically, megamind is the villain of the movie, and he likes this woman named Roxanne (the louis lane of this movie except sarcastic). But she ofc doesn’t like him bc he’s the villain of the book and ends up *killing* what is basically Superman in this book (however they never dated like in the original comics/movies). 

So he ends up (on accident at first) changing his appearance and pretending to be another man and him and Roxanne end up kinda dating. They kiss, she eventually finds out it’s Megamind, she’s upset, blah, blah, blah. 

But this is what I’m interested in. A villain mmc pretending to be someone else to get closer to the FMC.

1axgiuz,Can someone who’s read Bride by Ali Hazelwood tell me if these aspects of her writing changed,"Hey all!
I am a big big fantasy fan and really enjoy all forms of it, but I have had an awful time with Ali Hazelhood, and was wondering about whether these two things happen in Bride before I read that too:
1. I read her book about the chess players and the Love Hypothesis, and I found the FMCs soooo unbearable - they were stubborn and unaware beyond forgiveness, were characterized as geniuses in their field but had no actual critical thinking skills
2. In line with the first item, the conflict in both books was just driven by FMC-caused-miscommunication, where her lack of awareness of her partner’s thoughts/feelings for no understandable reason was the only source of conflict

Reading these two books put me in a huge reading slump right after, and I really don’t want that to happen with Bride as well, since I don’t have that much time to read anyway. Can anyone tell me if the conflict is driven by miscommunication? And/or if you felt similarly about other Ali Hazelwood books as I have if you’re internally screaming at the FMC to get her act together in Bride? On face value I think Bride is right up my alley, but I have just had such a hard time with Ali Hazelwood.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1axgiuz/can_someone_whos_read_bride_by_ali_hazelwood_tell/,2024-02-22T20:18:51Z,15,21,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST

I recently read a book where the 2 main characters hadn’t had a single personal conversation before their first kiss, I DNF’d at 51%. There wasn’t even sexual tension between them. 

I want a book with so much build up and relationship building before the relationship starts. I want them to get to know each other (preferably on page), I want sweet tender moments, I want friendship, I want sexual tension. Basically I wanna be the third in their relationship, I wanna feel like I know them too. 

I’ll take any trope as long as it’s contemporary.  It has to be at least new adult, I’m too old to be reading about high schoolers. I’d prefer at least one sex scene that’s not fade to black.

19cx2fy,Thanks to {The first and last demon by Hiyodori} for getting me out of my book slump,"I made it one of my 2024 goals to read more FF. Despite this being my preferred type of real-life relationship, I was having trouble finding a book that I vibe with (Somwhow I keep picking up books where the MCs do war crimes for some reason???). But yall. This book.

I read 200+ books a year so I normally see the plot points coming a mile away, but I could not figure this book out. It kept me on my toes the entire time. And I loved the MCs dynamic. 

Some of my favorite quotes from the book:

> ""That’s the beauty and wonder of magic. No internal consistency? No problem.”


> “Your life is my life,” she pronounced. “You think I would let anyone else have a chance at you? They won’t touch a single flake of your skin. I’d devour you whole before I let them shed a drop of your blood.”


> >!I’ve done everything I could possibly stomach. I dropped you off the top of that godforsaken tower. “Still you look at me mildly. Perhaps a touch warily. No real resentment. No fire. No matter how hard I’ve worked to deserve it.” She sat back. Her fingers loosened. She spoke plainly now, a limp weight atop me, emotion draining out of her and down into the pavement like old rainwater. “No matter what I do, you won’t hate me.”!<


> “Your nobility is wasted on me,” Vesper said. “I despise your selflessness. I spit on your restraint""

vnvl2q,The moment when The Bridge Kindgom made me want to crawl out of my skin (SPOILER),"What do you mean he pulled out a clean sheet of paper TT-TT

What do you mean he won’t tell her about the letter he sent ..

What do you mean that she counted 26 sheets because his old sheet was hidden…

When I read about him pulling out the fresh sheet my jaw dropped and I literally had to look away from my kindle and stare at the wall for a few minutes to regain my composure. I’m pretty new to reading as a whole but a book has never done this to me and I hope it never will again because the anticipation and anxiety is making it so hard to read on :,)

Edit: okay here’s what happened for those of you who wish to be spoiled lol- sorry i probably gave too much info ahah

The FL (Lara) was raised to marry and spy on the ML (Aren) who is the king of the bridge kingdom. When she gets to the bridge kingdom Aren tries to hide the secrets of the bridge kingdom from Lara to keep it safe from her father who is a king of Maridrina (different kingdom) and anyone else since if these secrets are known, the bridge kingdom can basically be invaded. Lara has no way of reaching out to her father since her letters are read and any code can be intercepted so she uses invisible ink to write the secrets on all of Aren’s parchment sheets so that if any letter is sent to her father, the secrets are on it. Throughout the book Lara falls in love with Aren (obviously) and eventually learns the truth about the kingdoms and finds out that her father is an oppressor and lied to her. Lara then tells herself she needs to destroy all the sheets with the invisible ink but something traumatic happens so she doesn’t do it straight away and during the time she’s recovering Aren writes a letter to the king. The problem is that Aren had already began a polite letter to the king ages ago before she used the invisible ink but hid it in a hidden compartment but this time when writing it he didn’t wish to be polite so he took out the letter he had begun and left it on his desk and then decided to start again on a “clean” sheet (the one that has the invisible ink). He sends it but doesn’t tell Lara. Lara then goes in to the study counts all the sheets (she wrote in the ink on 26 of them) and the total she gets is 26 so then she ruins all of them and thinks she was successful, problem is that one of the sheets she counted was the one that was hidden before and didn’t have the invisible ink on it so she doesn’t even realise she needs to stop the letter that does have the ink.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/vnvl2q/the_moment_when_the_bridge_kindgom_made_me_want/,2022-06-30T01:09:21Z,63,69,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST

11h6h9i,"Just read a blog post about an author ""writing for market"" and its put me off their books - anyone find this happens?","I'm in the middle of reading the authors book and did a bit of googling about them. They have an ""advice for authors"" section on their website that is basically like ""write what people want, but do it well"" and it's left a bad taste in my mouth.

I obviously want authors to make money, but they kept going on about ""how to get a six figure salary"" etc. and I hate how much hustle culture is embedded in writing (especially self-publishing).

I was really enjoying the book, but now feel played and not sure I can finish it. Anyone else had a situation like this?

Edit: This is so I don't keep repeating myself.

First off, thank you to everyone who commented, I've upvoted everyone because the discourse has been varied and respectful ✌️ (sorry if I've missed you, I feel a bit snowed under with the comments).

I just want to reiterate, I don't grudge authors a livelihood. The thing that got me was this author was already earning tens of thousands of dollars a year and wanted to get a six figure salary. They are also in a two income household.

They have written other books and felt their sales were low before, so gamed it out with the trope thing and went on an expensive course that the author of Twilight apparently did. So this use of multiple trendy tropes  combined with what the course said (epic cliffhangers at the end of each book, make one popular series not lots of standalone books etc.) and I felt played by it.

The reason I went on the blog in the first place was because I thought the books were a duology but the latter half started to spin out a bit and I wanted to see if it was a series. Sure enough, it is.

The author said they were an avid fantasy romance reader but had to look up tropes that are obvious to me. I'm also a voracious fantasy romance reader and I'm the same age as the person, and the fact they had to research the tropes made me think they were actually not into fantasy and just looking to make money.

The long and short of it is, this thread was a great way to talk this out and has made me reconsider. I will probably finish the book/rest of the series after all. 

P.S. I live in Scotland and a six figure salary would be loads here - it's five times what I earn and I live in a major city and own a flat with my partner.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/11h6h9i/just_read_a_blog_post_about_an_author_writing_for/,2023-03-03T17:12:39Z,152,65,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST

v2zsrj,"Would you consider me as someone who is ""well-read"" when it comes to romance novels?","Here's an introduction about myself. I'm a 25 year old guy and I started reading romance novels in 2015. Since then, I've read 23 romance novels and I can definitely say that romance is my favorite genre when it comes to books. However, most of them have been from the same author. Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author. I've read all of his novels and I always buy every new book that he releases.

As of late, I've been expanding my horizons when it comes to reading different types of romance novels. Nicholas Sparks novels are mostly romantic dramas but I wanted something more. I really enjoyed watching Bridgerton on Netflix and I'm currently in the process of reading the entire series.

I'm also going to read the six book versions of romantic comedies that I've loved on Netflix such as The Kissing Booth (3 books) and To All The Boys I've Loved Before (3 books). Last but not the least, I'm going to read ""The Last Letter from Your Lover"" by Jojo Moyes because I loved the movie on Netflix and I enjoyed reading one of her previous works (Me Before You).

So yeah, that's basically who I am when it comes to being a fan of romance novels. I've read 23 romance novels as of today and I will have read 36 by the time I'm done reading everything on my list. By the time I'm done reading, I will have read romantic dramas (Nicholas Sparks and Jojo Moyes), historical romances (Bridgerton), and romantic comedies (To All The Boys and The Kissing Booth).

Would you consider me as someone who is ""well-read"" in terms of romance novels? If not, what other possible sub-genres of romance novels could I read in order to broaden my horizons? (except erotic and fantasy romance novels. Books like Fifty Shades and Twilight aren't my type. I prefer fictional stories which take place in the real world and aren't too focused on sex )",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/v2zsrj/would_you_consider_me_as_someone_who_is_wellread/,2022-06-02T03:36:23Z,27,0,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
vr8s9z,Prisoner Of My Desire by Johanna Lindsey was the darkest romance book I ever read.. hear me out!,"Ok so I know people who love Dark themed or taboo romances are rolling their eyes at that title, but I'm not joking, reading that book had me uneasy!

For those who haven't read it, it gets recommended here a lot of when people ask for books with the characters being tied up or forced. So I knew going in that I was going to get some noncon. 

Side point before I get started on my explanation, this books cover is soft pink with a nice flower on it! So right off the bat I had my guard down!

So I've read my share of Dark romances, but this one just hit me in a different way. >!Basically a Lady has to get impregnated immediately, to secure an Inheritance or her mother's life will be taken. A man is kidnapped and brought to her and she is forced to rape him. He is actually a knight and seeks revenge for her stealing his ""seed"" and forcing him to find pleasure in the rape. He escapes and comes back to capture the castle and imprison the FMC. He then proceeds to do the same to her that was done to him, so tie her to a bed and rape her (but he gives her unwanted pleasure from the act). But he also keeps her in a dungeon, makes her a serf, belittles her, threatens to have her raped by other men, etc etc.!<

So i think it was the year that threw me. I've never read a medieval romance before, but it being set in the 1100s made this all seem so much harsher than books with similar themes set in modern times, or even the 1800s! I think it's because maybe books set in modern times where the woman is being mistreated, you know she has *some* power, and she has her own money and people will listen to her (for the most part) and she basically isn't completely helpless to fight him off.

This book the FMC has literally no power! She was completely helpless. Yes, she had her *feminine wiles* to manipulate him, but when he threw her in the dungeon to get raped by the jailor, until he changed his mind at the last minute there was nothing she could do. 

Basically I just found the setting to make this book 100 times darker than anything else I read. It made me very tense reading it. I couldn't get out of my head enough about the horrible times those woman lived in, to just enjoy the plot.

I personally despise unlikable heroines. As one example, I threw the book Outlander across the room and refused to watch the series for years after after trying a few episodes before I finall came around (huuuuuge fan now) because I despised Claire so much. 

But what I'm noticing is that there seem to be a good number of readers who actively want an unlikable heroine. What's the appeal?

I’ll be forever indebted to you. 🙏,"This is reminiscent of the very first post I made on the sub. And still nothing. (But oh the memories 🥰)

I write to you of this burning need in my heart at 4:30am, (after awakening with the idea of this post at 2am). 

I know you guys have generous hearts in there. Please try it out for me and recommend something as funny?... I’ll love you forever and ever. ❤️ (Or simply acknowledge my plight, I’ll eat it up with gratitude like a sad, lonely little puppy dog 😞) 

Please?

Please please please please please?

Pretty please with a cherry on top? 🍒 

(Prostrates self before thee) 

Link to book: [What Happens in London](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5500109-what-happens-in-london?from_search=true&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;from_srp=MYqHSalAkW&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1)

So far the only book I’ve been able to find with kinda the same sort of humor style is [The Autumn Duke ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51260711-the-autumn-duke) by Jillian Eaton. And some ever so brief humorous fragments of other JQ books here and there. (LK too to a very small extent). Whereas What Happens in London has me laughing *almost throughout.*

I’ve read Tessa Dare’s Goddess of the Hunt and Wallflower Wager (which the latter is said to beat all in Tessa Dare’s humor department?). 

Basically, for me, What Happens in London was like the Goat Scene over and over and over again. 

*Let that sink in.* 

Glad you understand. 

Thank you so much for your time lovelies. 😘

(The moment I’m done with the romance I just started, Storm Winds, I’m hopping right on the recommendations! But beware I naturally pay more heed to ones which come from people who’ve read What Happens in London in comparison. I can’t help my bias).

Taking all genres. (Even non-romance is alright if you feel I should know about it)

Edit: I would like to say, the WHiL kind humor is a silly kind of humor I think, and a mockery of British high society.

Edit: I also wanted to say, PLEASE don’t be nervous about recommending or think that it might not live up to my expectations. Lay ‘em on me.

Edit: Will begin with [First Comes Scandal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42874513-first-comes-scandal#) by JQ and update you all. - I decided to try an audiobook which I never do, and realized that JQs humor doesn’t translate very well in audiobook format. But I’ve had some chuckles/smiles and one hearty laugh so far. At ch. 6. I still have 7 more hrs to go! 😥 god I had no idea audiobooks were this slow

Edit: if you would be so kind, please let me know if you’ve read WHiL before recommending. I’m open to trying all, but just need to know 😁

Edit: OK it’s settled. You guys are fucking amazing. This sub is fucking amazing. Love you guys🤘 thank you in advance for all the people trying it out. Don’t want crowd the comment section with my thank you’s.

Edit: for the CRs recs, thank you for those! I’ll try them when I’ve exhausted a few HRs. Thanks in advance!

Edit: thanks guys! I’ll read these within the next few weeks and update in the WDYR!

o37p2q,"The People We Meet On Vacation by Emily Henry reminded me what it felt like to fall in love with my husband. The banter, the giddy rush of excitement, the pangs of uncertainty and longing - GAHHH this book - it speaks to me!","This is my 66th romance novel this year and I haven't written a single review, but I absolutely have to gush and gush *and gush* about this book. I happy cried. **IT. WAS. BREATHTAKING.**

**TL;DR** Emily Henry, take all of my money forever. I will read anything you write. PLEASE. MORE.

You know that feeling of belonging that makes your heart constrict with happiness when you’re a part of an inside joke? How *special* it feels to be included, particularly if you've been excluded before and know how shitty it feels? *That*, my romance lovin' friends, is what reading this freaking book felt like. I was included in not one but **MANY** excellent inside jokes. With past and present timelines, Emily Henry gives you the jokes' origin stories *and then* does call back after hilarious call back in the most subtle way. It’s something I didn’t even realize I needed until now. 

**(FMC)** Poppy is my favorite kind of heroine. FUNNY and often lacking in filter. Unapologetically herself.

**(MMC)** Alex is a kind Beta hero. I LOVE KIND HEROS! He's hilarious and secretly weird, but only lets Poppy see his weird *(fans self).* He’s attractive without being vain and is adorably unaware of the effect he has on women. 

**Only a little steamy** (similar level to Beach Read).

**Tropes:** >!Slow burn, Friends to lovers, Forced proximity/only one bed, and my personal favorite: the even more spoilery “he’s been in love with her the whole time” trope. OH and it has dual timelines like the second chance romance trope though I wouldn’t really classify it as one.!<

So often when I’m reading romance it seems like the author gives the characters just enough personality to make them believable while still being vague enough for the characters to be considered attractive to as many readers as possible. This book though, you guys, *these* characters feel *real* to me. They're unique. If you were to tell me that this book is based on a true story I would 100% believe you. I *want* to believe you. 



**Things that make this book so special: (definitely probably contains more spoilers than tags)**

* How quick witted and fun their banter is.
* Trip descriptions good enough to make any travel writer proud.

* The body positive comments from her mom that make me want to do this for my children someday: >!”Vanity is something he was raised to avoid. Whereas my mom used to write little notes on my bathroom mirror in dry-erase marker: Good morning to that beautiful smile. Hello, strong arms and legs. Have a great day, lovely belly that feeds my darling daughter. Sometimes I still hear those words when I get out of the shower and stand in front of the mirror, combing my hair: Good morning, beautiful smile. Hello, strong arms and legs. Have a great day, lovely belly that feeds me.”!<

* Poppy’s reasons for loving The Bachelor.

* The games they make up together.

* *What in Sam Hill was Buck saying on that GD water taxi, amirite?*

* **Have I mentioned that I love a good call back???**

* How much Poppy loves her family and struggles internally not to be embarrassed by them. 

* How much the main characters click despite how different they are. 

* They both go to therapy (*hellooooo* self-awareness and character development).

* *“Naked Alex”*

* Alex’s sensitivity to Poppy’s teasing. Emily Henry really caught me with the feels when >!Poppy realizes that Alex has stopping doing certain things in front of her for fear that she’ll make fun of him.!< It’s such a real aspect of any long lasting relationship, and I love how Poppy learns to think before she speaks more often as she grows up.

* Alex confessing that >!he remembers everything (all their little inside jokes she thought he had forgotten).!<

* I LOVED hearing what Alex was thinking and feeling. The angst when >!Poppy confronts Alex about having bought an engagement ring for Sarah and he tells her how much her pregnancy scare effected him and how EVERYTHING is because of her.!<

Now, I’m not just saying this because I grew up near those giant Cabazon dinosaurs or because I first started to fall for my husband in a grove of giant redwoods or because he makes this exact joke >!“When our server left us with our menus, Alex did that old-man thing, where he opened it and reared back from the prices with widening eyes, like a startled horse.”!< and I find it hilarious EVERY TIME, **BUT, I feel like this book was written just for me. Or, you know, for Poppy and Alex who are definitely real human beings who exist on earth.**

And while I did think the conflict >!in Croatia was a bit anticlimactic and not a good enough reason to let a friendship that important fade away!< I did feel that Poppy needed those two years to focus on her career and realize she wasn't happy. Long distance friendships *are* really challenging. I felt the ending more than made up for it.

Damn this magical book. . . so relatable. It just freaking *speaks* to me, you know?

**Editing to add anecdotal update:**  After posting this I told my husband that I mentioned him in this post and he asked if he could see what I wrote. *Weeeellllll*, I’ve since been properly admonished (mostly joking) about how I probably shouldn’t use terms like “alpha and beta” because **toxic masculinity**. Which, okay, he’s totally right about. BUT it’s also how we talk about characters on this sub and referring to them in their simplest form helps us find the kinds of books we are actually looking for, right? Anyway, I responded with some equally classy version of, ”You don’t even go here!” (here obviously being this sub) in true Mean Girls fashion. However, I’m not changing it because *apparently* I’ve found the metaphorical hill I’m willing to die on. **He also insists that he is, and I quote, “Waaaay funnier than that Alex guy.”** I then asked if he was dying to print out my post so he could copy edit it with a red pen (another way my husband is eerily similar to Alex). *le sigh* marital bliss, amirite? 🤣🤣🤣",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/o37p2q/the_people_we_meet_on_vacation_by_emily_henry/,2021-06-19T04:02:36Z,59,395,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST

Instead of a glimpse into the past, or the POV of unknown/unusual character- the prologue is a climactic scene in the story itself. You get to the official start of Chapter 1 and realize now you’ll be reading the story until you reach the point *you’ve already read.*

I have read prologues that not only show the peak (future) conflict of the story, but genuinely destroy a plot twist I would not have seen coming otherwise. Why?? I was so frustrated I skipped all prologues for a long time afterward before I started carefully reading them again and avoiding any obvious warnings (chapter 1 starting with “6 months earlier…” etc). But sometimes there is absolutely no warning. 

I feel like there should be a “spoiler warning” in front of these or something so I can allow myself to go in blind if I want to.

vxbzj8,The Lord I Left suprised me in the best way,"{The Lord I Left by Scarlett Peckham}

I've never reviewed or gushed about a book before but I felt like I needed to for this one! 

I went into this book expecting it to be similar to {Priest by Sierra Simone} and got something much better. While I loved Priest, The Lord I Left just hit so much better for me.

I loved that Henry, the MMC, was not this overly macho man who had plenty of sorrid affairs, but instead was a sweet, inexperienced, sometimes over excited virgin. He fumbled with his sexual desires as a man of god. You could tell he genuinely struggled with overcoming his beliefs to come to terms with being a sexual being.

The FMC, Alice, on the other hand was accepting of her sensuality from the start. She left home to work at a whipping house with the intent to maybe become the Mistress. I loved how comfortable Alice is with herself and I love that the author had one of the first scenes be a solo one. Alice boldly admits to maturbating and having lovers. 

My absolute favorite thing about this book is how Alice will not sacrifice who she is for Henry's love. It's so refreshing particularly for a HR. 

I would say the only fumble would be the lack of detail when they finally have sex for the first time, but the scenes before were well detailed and steamy (particularly the scene where he walks in on her, and then the following chapter or 2 🫠🔥).

fuzysx,"Is it me, or is the Kindle Unlimited recommendation engine a trainwreck?","I don't know if that's even the right terminology, but whatever KU uses to find recommendations is super hinky. Of course lots of the top listings are paid promotions, and i know it's a saturated marketplace, but it's like the Augean stables of book titles.

There's a section for ""improve your recommendations"" in your amazon account, but only applies to books purchased, not borrowed. 

The app can track how many pages you've read in a book, obviously can track your ratings and viewings, but i feel like this is what i see for recs, in order of frequency:

You liked that book? Here are 30 more with the exact same plot and cover, mostly of a lower quality. You have to sift through these in order to get to the rest. And it's the same crap batch every day for a month or two, you can't mark them as ""no thanks""

Here are 20 terrible looking books in subgenres you've never read, that appear to have been churned out of a word factory. No way to say ""never show me this shit again"" because Amazon is probably making bank on the promotion fees or something. 

Here's every book ever by an author you gave three stars to once. We know what you like. 🤨

Here are five books you've already read. Wanna read em again? Huh? We know you do.

Here are three books you returned before 20%, perhaps you'd like to read those again? While you're at it, want to call a toxic ex and ""try again""?

Here are two books that look good. Grab them now cause we'll never suggest them again.

Here are two books that look passable for when you're bored. You're welcome.

Here's a political nonfiction for the hell of it. 🤷‍♂️

Ope, that's the end of our recommendation page! We know there's 83,000 books in your genre here, but we'll show you the same few dozen titles over and over until you die. There might be new authors buried in the stables but you'll have to find them some other way. You can try Goodreads but we own them too lol. 🤦‍♀️

umrhce,Looking for Fantasy Romance suggestions that don't make me want to strangle the main character's necks every 5 minutes,"I am very new to FR and only used to read HR before. I read Night Circus a few years ago and adored the book. I recently reread it and I love it so much. I love the longing and yearning between the FMC and MMC. Ideally I'd like something similar.

I also read Uprooted recently. The prose in the book was beautiful and apparently I'm a sucker for beautiful prose. I didn't like how the book didn't have enough romance in it but overall, I enjoyed it.

I was recommended From Blood and Ash. I read the first book and the FMC is one of the most annoying characters I have read in a while. I finished the first book because I was curious about the plot but I really don't feel like picking up the second book. Does it get any better?

Anyway, so I'm looking for FR suggestions. I am not particular about tropes. I like well-written books. I also like books where the  FMC discovers that she has powers (e.g: Uprooted).

I know the request is vague but I don't know enough about FR to understand what I am looking for. I already have ACOTAR on my list after seeing so many recommendations. Please help?

tv7xjl,Credence by Penelope Douglas made me want to throw up,"*Sorry for any mistake/typos.

Just finished reading this book and I feel sickened. I have read countless taboo/dark romance stories and none of them made me feel like this.

What honestly disturbed the most me was the fact that PD romanticizes all the abuse the girl goes through. And constantly justifies it with the character's shitty past. 

The female character convinces herself all the abuse she goes through is somehow love. The dude she ends up with (spoiler /TW): almost raped her, gets physical with her in countless occasion, spits on her face and writes ""slut"" on her forehead. She is truly terrified of him but we are supposed to believe that deep down he loves her and they get their HEA. In real life she would have ended 6 feet under either because he kills her in one of his violent episodes or she just ends it herself.

I was so disturbed I skipped all the streamy parts because I just couldn't read how this girl confused sex with being loved. It was just sad.

This isn't my first PD book and to this day Birthday Girl is one of my favorite romances, but to me this was just awful. 

If you liked this novel don't come at me. It's just my personal experience. 
If you have never read a PD novel I would recommend going through some reviews before reading  her books. They could trigger a lot of people.

EDIT:

Just wanted to add my biggest issue is the ending. 
If the author really wanted to give us a HEA with one of the MCs then I believe she should have made the girl realize she was being abused. Made her leave, go to uni, make friends, have for the first time in her life a healthy relationship and years later reconnect with on of the MCs (not Kaleb, he can burn in hell). And ONLY if the guy had truly undergone a major transformation as well. Honestly, the only character this could have worked with is Noah. I have read many reviews saying he was the best character, but let's not forget he was also horrible to her. Yes, he saved her from being raped but completely justified his brothers actions, allowed his brother to continue mistreating her and also sexually assaulted her himself when he got drunk. 

This being said the best ending for me would have been if she had left them all to rot and never looked back. 


So my next read will be a sugary sweet romance. Any recommendations? I need to erase this from my memory.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/tv7xjl/credence_by_penelope_douglas_made_me_want_to/,2022-04-03T12:14:56Z,70,150,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
1af5063,"Loser of the love triangle loses FMC for moral reasons (it's a sort of complicated request, let me explain)","So we all love villains, right? The obsessive heroes, the ""touch-her-and-you-die"", the *shadow daddies.*  Everyone knows the whole ""a hero would let you go to save the world but a villain would burn the world to save you"" thing. Similarly, I think most of us are also all familiar with love triangles and the romantic false lead - the one who's set up as the MMC but turns out to be a dick before we meet the real (villain) MMC. >!Tamlin!<from ACOTAR, >!Dain!<from Fourth Wing.

This might be too specific for me to have a chance of finding it, but what I'm looking for is an at-least-two-books series that hits two main criteria:

1) There's a love triangle with two guys, the Villain MMC and the more traditional ""good guy"" type, and the good guy loses the FMC not because he's an asshole, but over a moral judgment he makes. Maybe the villains held the FMC hostage and offered to exchange her in return for a deadly world-threatening-superweapon and the good guy refused to hand it over, maybe there was a group of people in danger and she was the one who was put on the wrong side of the Trolley Problem, maybe he wanted to put some people who attacked her in prison but refused to kill them himself, maybe he was just disturbed by her continued corruption by the Villain MMC. Whatever it is, he picks the ""good guy side"" over his love of the FMC, and then the Villain MMC swoops in and snatches her up for shadow daddy sexy times.

2) The Good Guy is then the MMC of a following book where he finds love with a different girl.

11kjcta,{You & Me by Tal Bauer} is my new favorite CR,"I’ve been reading romance books for years now, but today I just finished the best contemporary romance book I’ve ever read. I usually only stick to MF or RH books, but I’ve never been more glad that I tried something new. You & Me is a MM friends to lovers romance, with both MCs being single fathers. I LOVED watching their romance progress, and I couldn’t stop smiling while I was reading this book. They were just so adorable together and they had so much chemistry. The author also did an amazing job showing the growth in the relationship between MC1 and his son, who he hadn’t had a great relationship with since the death of his wife (not a spoiler, this is very obvious right off the bat). 

I just want to say, I’ve never written a gush post before now, but this book was absolutely worth it. By the end, I was crying because of how perfect the MCs were together 😅.

At the end of my library’s copy, there was a discussion question - “At the end of the book, Ama and Elliot’s views on marriage seem to have flipped, with Ama proposing to Elliot everyday and Elliot saying no. What do you think Elliot is waiting for? Do you think Elliot thinks Ama is still opposed to getting married? What can she do to convince him otherwise?” 

I didn’t think that Elliot was necessarily saying no because he thought Ama didn’t really want to get married, my view was more that they both learned to see the others perspective (albeit in a more healthy way) - Ama learned to not to assume a relationship had to end and to plan for the future, whereas Elliot learned to enjoy the moment and not live in the future. As for what Elliot was waiting for, I just assumed he wanted to enjoy that dating phase of the relationship before they got married, after having spent so long apart.

qm586s,Can someone suggest to me a slow burn fantasy romance book (or short series?),"Hello!! 

I’ve been trying to find a fantasy book that’s a slow burn romance but I haven’t been able to find something that quite scratches the itch I’m looking for. 

I looooove slow burn romance, I love the relationship building up and the main characters starting out indifferent towards each other but then slowly falling in love. I am ok with insta-lust but definitely like the fight to not give in. I don’t like insta love, so much. I prefer friends-to lovers but enemies to lovers is good too! 

I just finished reading the first three books in Ilona Andrews series Hidden Legacy. I love that it took a few books before the main couple was official, and I love that there was some spicy tension between them. I prefer my male leads to be a little jealous and definitely protective. I thought the books were fine- they weren’t (in my opinion) amazing but they were good. Sort of like how Janet Evonavich books are fun reads, these felt similar. 

I don’t really like young adult books, and I don’t really like books where there are love triangles (it makes me anxious lol). That being said I am looking for a fantasy book (or series) that’s long enough to give that good slow burn feel! I want to say like under 5 books would probably be my hope. 

I don’t care what time period it takes place, I don’t care how many books it takes to lead up to intimacy (but if it takes awhile I want the spicy scenes to be open door).  

I am open to most things, I like magic, I like smooching and I like smouldering, a little possessive main love interests. Mostly I just want to feel invested in the love story and have it feel genuine (and hot).

I made a post awhile back about slow burn books and I read most of them(I have a few to go still) but right now I’m itching for some spicy slow burn sorcery! 

Thank you so much in advance, I will check out every recommendation. (Also I searched the subreddit first before posting but couldn’t quite find what I was looking for)

I also read the Rhapsodic series by Laura Thalassa awhile ago and remember thinking it was fun, and I read the bird and the sword books by Amy Harmon and I didn’t like them very much but I read those awhile ago and I remember liking the idea of the books but not liking the love story of that makes sense. I read the mistborn books a looooong time ago and loved the writing but don’t remember the romance (I saw that being recommended a bit).

vkppm5,Help me find a happy world to disappear into?,"I read to escape reality, especially global politics. It’s just too depressing at the moment. So I avoid UK and US-based novels if I can but also HR (I’m a history professor and so this just doesn’t work for me). Most European settings are also out (unless written by authors from those respective countries), because often the inaccuracies irk me too much (you can tell I’m a grouch!).

I therefore really love fantasy: paranormal, urban, high fantasy, anything. Especially if it’s not just a focus on the couple (werewolves and fated mates tend not to work that well for me because of that) but an entire world in which you become immersed. Ideally a happy and quirky world. Not relentless violence and misery (or bad grammar. That’s nearly as bad. See grouch and professor above) but magic and humour. No angst either. I’m middle-aged and overworked and have no energy left for teenage angst.

What I adore (and 100% recommend!) are:
Ilona Andrews (everything)
Thea Harrison
Elizabeth Hunter (the elemental series)
Sherwood Smith
Helen Harper (I adore the slouch witch and the fairy godmother series. Some of the earlier and current ones are a bit too dark and tense for me)
Ursula Vernon
Nicole Peeler (why did she stop writing?!)
Hailey Edwards 
Rachel Aaron (the dragons series and the DFZ one)
KM Shea
Devon Monk (Ordinary Magic)
Camilla Monk (no relation, I presume, and also not really fantasy, but so gloriously funny)


I also loved WR Gingell and Victoria Goddard (and Diana Wynne Jones of course) though those aren’t strictly-speaking romances.

I quite enjoyed (& would also recommend) Rider’s Sundance series, Patricia Briggs, Janiene Frost, Meljean Brook, Karen Chance (before she started self publishing that is), AJ Lancaster, Olivia Atwater, Intisar Khanani, Anne Bishop, and Heather G Harris.

I recently finished (and reread) all of Victoria Goddard (when the Pali Avrampoul book came out), then the latest in Monk’s Ordinary Magic series and finally the latest in the Black Hat Bureau series. And after that I felt bereft. Partly because I wanted to go and live in Victoria Godard’s world - or failing that at least have a friendly demon housemate - and partly because I felt that there is no series or world out there left for me to escape into.

Is there? Could you recommend anything? I read very quickly and am terribly impatient, so something that’s already complete would be wonderful!

So.... I just finished Requiem and I am blown away. I have not emerged as the same person I was before I started reading. However, I have some lingering questions I hope a Redditor will be able to help me solve as they're burning a hole in my brain. MASSIVE spoilers ahead obviously.

\>!WHO THE F WAS MEL???!!! At the beginning, now I know the twist, I don't understand who Mel was and why she is never mentioned again. President Ford says last year's junior year was transferred elsewhere to finish their senior year, and that most of the students in Sorrell's year (apart from Beth, Ash, Theo, Lani, Callum, Sebastian) are all new students. So who is Mel? Also, at First Night, Sebastian acts as if he recognises the girls, but allegedly the seniors are all new. Also, in homeroom, Sorrell overhears everyone reuniting after the holidays, but this wouldn't happen if everyone was new. They are the main things I'm confused about! I guess none of the teachers or years below let the secret slip, but I am so confused who everyone else was. Also, how could Theo be popular if everyone was new? How did everyone know him? How did people know each other? Did Mel know Sorrell's story?!<

Any discussion welcome about this, thank you in advance!

11mujcb,books like the song 'cowboy like me' by Taylor Swift,"Hi everyone, I really hope you can help me out with a book rec!!!

One of my favourite Taylor Swift songs is 'cowboy like me' and it tells the story of 2 con artists accidentally falling in love. I love the whole vibe of the song, it's romantic, dark, sexy and just beautiful. I imagine the 2 MC's meeting in a dark bar and trying to out swindle eachother before slowly falling deeply in love. I would love a book like this with them maybe trying to out swindle eachother and maybe it has ranch vibes?

If your not aware of the songs the link is https://youtu.be/YPlNBb6I8qU and I particularly love these lyrics that makes me feel like I'm listening to a Romance book:

""And you asked me to dance
But I said, ""Dancing is a dangerous game""

""Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one""

""You're a cowboy like me
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it""

And my personal fave😭😭-
""Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con""

mfdpbt,The Wall of Winnipeg and Me Rant,"Let me start off by saying I thought I really disliked Mariana Zapata. The eternal inner monologuing and little dialogue is not my cup of tea at all. When I started The Best Thing I honestly think I read 20 pages of inner monologuing about some guy she didn't like before even finding out who the hell she was talking about. On top of it I find most of her FMC's inner thoughts to be insufferable and bitchy. Every FMC also has some ""dark background story"" that they constantly reference internally for the entire book before you finally found out what the hell it is. 

However, I decided to dive into The Wall of Winnipeg and Me because 1) Everyone talks about it literally all the time and 2) I love sports romances.

So far I'm really enjoying it. I find Vanessa slightly better than most of her characters, I enjoy forced proximity, I love fake marriages, all of it. Then I suddenly realize about 40% in that the fact Aiden is some football star has absolutely no bearing on the story. Normally this wouldn't bother me but it's literally labeled and clearly marketed as a sports romance. You could change his job to literally any type of famous person, movie star, billionaire entrepreneur, hockey star, president, really anything and the book would be the same. I will say I'm only 40% in, and will I finish it anyway? Absolutely. Thinks might change.

But to me, why do authors feel the need to categorize books and market them a certain way if it has no bearing on the story whatsoever? Maybe I'm just being nitpicky and annoying but if I pick up a sports romance I want a sports romance. So far the only thing remotely talked about sports wise is his injury or working out all the time. Which again, could be literally from anything. 

Feel free to nitpick my nitpicky-ness!

Edit: After finishing the book I will say towards the end it definitely felt more like a sports romance. She actually went to games, they talked about him playing, the possibility of him getting traded. 

I will also throw in that I enjoy slow burns but I don't think I'm a fan of BAM we had sex, the end. Epilogue: We're happy and had so many babies. I wish we could see more of the relationship after they get together.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/mfdpbt/the_wall_of_winnipeg_and_me_rant/,2021-03-29T00:24:42Z,20,25,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
18b3h3s,"Well, I haven’t cried from a book in quite some time and this paragraph from Lion’s Share by Rachel Vincent got me sobbing!😭","“Well, I like to think of virginity
as a state of sexual inexperience, and I believe that it can’t be taken. It can only be given, in exchange for a consensual,
illuminating, and hopefully really fulfilling introduction into the carnal arts,”…

I don’t want to give any more context because I don’t want to spoil anything but if you read her Shifter series years ago like me, and loved it, I definitely recommend diving into her Wildcats spin-off series! Which I just discovered, and have been devouring. 

A Trigger warning for the book includes a FMC character with a history of SA and  instances of this are peppered throughout both the Shifters and Wildcats series. This is a sensitive topic for me and I have to say, I really appreciate the authors approach to it.

I definitely recommend reading her short story {Hunt by Rachel Vincent} before starting {Lion’s Share by Rachel Vincent}  as it illuminates a lot and makes the first few chapters of the book much clearer.

It’s a M/F age-gap, cat shifter romance with lots of pack drama, secrets, and politics. As well as a being a bit violent, a little gory, and peppered with some light mystery. And might I say that the MMC, Jace is just…wow! 😻🔥

Oh and it’s also not Omegaverse!

{Blind Tiger by Rachel Vincent} and {Wild Card by Rachel Vincent} each with different couples in the same world.

l4hs3i,The way men are portrayed in many romance novels has really annoyed me lately - I am so sick of the underdeveloped cookie cutter alpha male,"Tell me if you’ve read this one: Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl because she’s smart and beautiful and courageous [insert more adjectives] and he’s utterly devoted to her. Girl falls is love with boy because.....like he’s hot? Oh and he’s protective. Aaaand he has the biggest cock she’s ever seen. Did she mention he’s hot?

The guy’s point of view is all about praising the girl and though her body is always praised, there’s also always more to her personality....but the girl really only talks about his body and things that embody the stereotypical alpha male [confidence, bossiness, protectiveness, etc].

This isn’t a rant against alpha males as a whole. I’ve read a number of stories with complex alpha male heroes, and those stories are *not* the ones I’m complaining about. 

What frustrates me is that I feel like I have read many stories with the cookie cutter alpha male - the hero who has no defining personality traits or interests beyond “I’m alpha”. With stories with these heroes, it really makes me question whether the two characters belong together. Like, if we hit rewind and made tiny adjustments to the circumstances, would fate still bring them back together because they’re so truly compatible? Or could the girl just as easily fall in love with any other attractive alpha-type and leave her original hero hanging? When I get to the end of a story, I want to look back and say “Yes, you two are MEANT to be together; this HEA really is forever.” And if the characters appear to have nothing in common (interests, values, sense of humor) then I have a hard time believing it.

**Loving that a person loves you isn’t enough; you have to actually love the person.** (And lusting after their body doesn’t count either.)

Also, I don’t know how I got this far without saying this, but super shallow portrayals of men are **incredibly** sexist. I get that romance as a genre is primarily consumed by heterosexual women and that a little fantasy is part of the appeal of the genre. But this argument really isn’t that different than those made by some men for shallow female characters as side pieces in action movies. In both cases, we as consumers should ask for better representation. 

End rant.

yv3rjq,Forget Me Not by Karissa Kinword,"I started reading {Forget Me Not by Karissa Kinword} last night and found the POV really strange. It is written in first person but then the main character (FMC) will start talking about the MMC in a way that is usually used in omniscient. I guess this would be first person omniscient, not something I’ve come across before. 

For example: *It’s Silas’s turn to gawk now, and somehow I’m even more beautiful to him in the flesh. He can’t help himself from looking directly into my eyes, mapping them from the deep blue pigment of my irises to the flutter of long eyelashes batting against my cheeks.*

I don’t know how I feel about this. I find the main character talking about themselves and then transitioning to talking about how someone else feels about them a little jarring. Why not just use third person omniscient? 

Have others came across books with this POV? What did you think? 

If anyone has read Forget Me Not let me know what you thought. 

I’m going to continue reading, I’m only 6% in so can’t tell if I like it or not.

199fwj8,Help me name this book: Arranged marriage kind of? Sisters force the eldest sister to get married so they can also marry,"Hello, I'm having a hard time finding the title of a book I read years ago. 

What I remember of the plot:
-the heroine was the eldest daughter in her family
-the heroine's name might have been Ella or Elena but I'm not sure. The hero may have been Alexander?
-the heroine's grandmother(I think) thought that the eldest should be married first and as a result the heroine's younger sisters all had to wait for her to get married before they could get married themselves
-the heroine's younger sister's all had boyfriends and each couple was eager to marry 
-the heroine's sisters decide to kidnap a man and force her to marry him; if I recall he was a doctor or a lawyer maybe
-the sister's boyfriends help to kidnap the bride and groom and assist in this ""arranged marriage""
-the hero and the heroine were not dating and didn't know each other very well when they were forced to marry

I believe the book was set in America, and I think in the West but it wasn't a cowboy genre if I'm remembering correctly. 🤔 

I remember the hero and the heroine having a falling out and she travels by train either to him or away from him. I think they have a son at some point in the book and there is a HEA. 

I appreciate any help in naming this book! Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/199fwj8/help_me_name_this_book_arranged_marriage_kind_of/,2024-01-18T03:05:37Z,2,7,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
zzdah1,FF Book Club Discussion: Kiss Her Once for Me,"Hello!

Wondering what this is?

It's a romance book club on this sub dedicated to books that feature an FF (female-female) pairing. Everyone is welcome to participate, regardless of their gender or sexuality.

**WARNING: This discussion will include spoilers for the whole book, so please avoid this post if you don’t want spoilers!**

#About the Book:

> A Best New Holiday Romance by PopSugar, BuzzFeed, Refinery29, and more!

> The author of the “swoon-worthy debut” (Harper’s Bazaar) The Charm Offensive returns with a festive romantic comedy about a woman who fakes an engagement with her landlord…only to fall for his sister.

> One year ago, recent Portland transplant Ellie Oliver had her dream job in animation and a Christmas Eve meet-cute with a woman at a bookstore that led her to fall in love over the course of a single night. But after a betrayal the next morning and the loss of her job soon after, she finds herself adrift, alone, and desperate for money.

> Finding work at a local coffee shop, she’s just getting through the days—until Andrew, the shop’s landlord, proposes a shocking, drunken plan: a marriage of convenience that will give him his recent inheritance and alleviate Ellie’s financial woes and isolation. They make a plan to spend the holidays together at his family cabin to keep up the ruse. But when Andrew introduces his new fiancée to his sister, Ellie is shocked to discover it’s Jack—the mysterious woman she fell for over the course of one magical Christmas Eve the year before. Now, Ellie must choose between the safety of a fake relationship and the risk of something real.

> Perfect for fans of Written in the Stars and One Day in December, Kiss Her Once for Me is the queer holiday rom-com that you’ll want to cozy up with next to the fire.


# Discussion:

Here are some thoughts and questions about the book to get the discussion started. You can talk about them in your comments or not, as you like! Any other thoughts also welcome.

1. How do you rate this book? Any scales and star systems welcome. Any general impressions - good/bad/ugly?
2. What did you think of our main character Ellie? What about her love interest, Jack?
3. Why do you think the author chose Kiss Her Once For Me as the title?
4. Instead of a love triangle, this book has a trapezoid - and a subverted fake relationship. How did you feel about the way those tropes were used?
5. There's a big cast of side characters, from Jack and Andrew’s family to co-workers to Ellie’s mom. Who was your favorite? Least favorite?
6. This book includes a lot of mental health rep.  What did you think about how the author handled it?
7. This book has a little steam. Did you enjoy it? What did you like or dislike?
8. What did you think about the scene with Claire?
9. Did you enjoy the time jumps or do you hate them?
10. We have two villains in the story - Ellie’s mom and Jack’s dad. We’re you satisfied with the resolution with these characters?
11. Did you enjoy the way it ended?

Thanks for reading with us! I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you again in 2023 for our next FF Book Club read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/zzdah1/ff_book_club_discussion_kiss_her_once_for_me/,2022-12-30T22:18:54Z,18,15,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
kq6ek8,Recommend me my first romance novel?,"Title.

I am a reader (and an aspiring writer) albeit usually fantasy and science fiction with the very ocassional bit of historical fiction. I haven't read a straight romance novel but I do really like a good romance sub-plot. 

Why this post now? 

I just finished Bridgerton. 

What I think I want?

A regency romance.

No smut. It's just unnecessary. There are enough places on the internet for that and I read in public. Before and after the deed, yes. Innuendo, yes! I have a real life talent for making almost anything an innuendo. 

Developed characters. One thing that I think Bridgerton got right was making everyone feel like a real character. 

At the bare minimum, PoVs for both leads. I want to guess that this is the norm?

I would strongly prefer that both characters start in the same place with their view on the relationship. Either they both want it or they both don't. I don't think I'd be a fan of one person doing a lot of chasing or only one partner being forced into the marriage.

Anything else that you could do with knowing?

I'm a man in my mid-late twenties. I say this because I'm aware that I am not the target demographic for the overwhelming majority of the genre. Not sure if it'll change your recommendations though.

I'll be able to deal with Heroes that are well muscled with abs. Mine are just hiding, I swear! 

If you guys know where I could discuss the Bridgerton TV show, that'd be great... Nobody in my life is going to watch it so...",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/kq6ek8/recommend_me_my_first_romance_novel/,2021-01-04T10:50:15Z,55,9,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
tkdbvm,The perils of challenging midlifecrackers by me OR Unsolicited Duke Pic by Nico Rosso,"In a recent discussion about the usefulness of GoodReads ratings, [I foolishly stated](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/tk28sx/comment/i1nqwjk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that I would read anything that u/midlifecrackers recommended. This novella was her swift response, [Unsolicited Duke Pic by Nico Rosso](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51048735-unsolicited-duke-pic), which I duly purchased forthwith, devoured and am here to foist on you all unapologetically.

&#x200B;

The steam is medium, possibly even high for historical, the premise is silly, the book is short at 130 pages, and my point is proven. Midlifecrackers is my book paladin, and her rec's are to be followed, for this was *awesome*.

&#x200B;

As a consequence of a lost wager, our MMC requires a portrait of his Ducal Dick that he can display to his curious club colleagues, before hanging in his dressing room. The FMC, a bisexual painter that has been blacklisted by an evil earl, is just desperate enough to take the commission. Unsurprisingly, a full day of banter over his manifest member puts a little sexual tension in the air, and our main couple get down and dirty right there in the studio. The sex is so good. So, so good. The scene where she, fingers entwined with his, teaches him exactly how to touch her clit? Fire, pure fire.

&#x200B;

I'm not going to spoil the rest of it, but damn this little book was fun. Oh, and u/OhMercyMercyMe84, you asked what good books you were missing by only reading books of 3.9 or above on GoodReads?

yp2rbc,help me please!,"I'll be honest, it's been ages since I've read this book and it could also not be a book, but a short story or something.

I remember the story was about a queen, whose husband died and had to remarry for political reasons.

As a last wish before the wedding, she wanted a night of pleasure and to be in control, since she never had it during the marriage. She ordered the palace guards to bring her a man and to have him tied to the bed.

15fbpby,Bring Me Your Midnight by Rachel Griffin releases today! Super cozy fantasy!,"I was lucky enough to read an ARC of this book and have been obsessed with it ever since.  To me it was the ultimate cozy fantasy with a super angsty forbidden romance!  It gave me Little Mermaid vibes almost! This was my first read by this author and I honestly just want to run away and live in the this little magical world she has created because her descriptions are just so enchanting and beautiful! 

This isn't a heavy world building fantasy, it's super light and fairytale esque so even if you don't normally read fantasy I would still check this one out! 

Readers are introduced to Tana, a young witch whose destiny has been predetermined since before her birth. She is meant to enter into a marriage with a human to secure an alliance, safeguarding her coven and forging connections with the non-magical mainland. However, as her wedding day and the inevitable binding to her coven draw nearer, Tana begins to question the truths she has been taught her entire life. In her blossoming relationship with Wolfe, a member of a secret coven, she confronts the ultimate choice: to adhere to the prescribed path and meet everyone's expectations or to forge her own destiny, even if it means disappointing her entire coven. 

I binged this book in one day and I just needed to share it with everyone! I already know this will be a cozy comfort re-read for me! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/15fbpby/bring_me_your_midnight_by_rachel_griffin_releases/,2023-08-01T12:50:27Z,8,13,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
18wk376,Does anyone read Call me Irresistible - Susan Elizabeth Philips? I have an urgent question,"Hi y’all!

So I just finished reading Call me Irresistible by Susan Elizabeth Philips and a part of the book get me scratch my head. I would really appreciate if you took time to let me sort this out as I read the book in English and am not native so maybe I’m missing a point - such as may be “they kissed” doesn’t mean a kiss to lips (I also don’t read other books in this series). The context is;

As you may remember there was a scene where the MMC (Ted) kissed his friend (Torie - his best female friend, as later revealed and a married woman) in his car in the gas station and FMC (Meg) seeing them from a far. He then also kissed Torie to make a point to Meg in Torie and her husband’s hotel room and Meg thought he was having an affair with a married woman. Later on, Torie revealed that her husband (Dexter) was in the room and that she told him about the kiss in which he replied that he draw a line at kissing basically, as far as I understood, informing them not to do it again. Although it was never discussed between the characters I think why Ted kissed Torrie the second time was because Meg was communicating with Lucie (the woman who left Ted at the altar 11 days prior to “gas station kiss”) and he was being petty hence his line before kissing Torie in the hotel room, something in the line of ‘Tell Lucy I missed her’. 

Sooo what I don’t get is didn’t they still kissed in the car in the gas station and didn’t tell Dexter? It was implied many times in the book that Ted has a very strong moral compass, and even if the kiss with his best friend wouldn’t mean anything to the either of them it still something they hide from Dexter (plus kissing in a car in a gas station seems a bit sketchy for bffs lol) as Torie only told him about the second kiss so either he wasn’t as noble or he saw Meg and was putting another show (consequently it was the day Meg told him how Lucie never mentions him in their phone calls). Or maybe I totally misunderstood what “they kissed” meant or maybe it was just Meg wrongly assuming they kissed although I would assume the author would pick another way to describe the situation if that was the case? And if Ted wasn’t aware Meg was at the gas station (which he didn’t give any indication that he was) how would we know he wouldn’t go around kissing Torie whether it is for comfort or for whatever, and even if it’s platonic? Torie’s husband was bothered by it so it kind of implies author at some level acknowledges it’s not something you would want your SO would be doing with their best friends. 

I would love love love if you share your thoughts and insights about this with me! I’m aware it’s on the side of over-analyzing but it’s fun! Lol! And happy new year to everybody!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/18wk376/does_anyone_read_call_me_irresistible_susan/,2024-01-02T07:55:06Z,2,6,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST

v7beoi,"I read a couple HR's and LOVED them, and then I've hated everything since. HELP ME PLS.","Guys, please go on a journey with me because I need help. A little over a year ago I read my first historical romance, **Bringing Down the Duke** by Evie Dunmore and absolutely loved it. I followed it up with **A Week to be Wicked** by Tessa Dare and was officially converted. Contemporary romance what?? They were both so fun, I loved Dunmore's political themes and Dare's smut!

Except every historical romance I've read since has been varying shades of disappointment. Excluding the other books in Dunmore's series, **A Rogue of One's Own** and **Portrait of a Scotsman**, which I loved dearly.

Here's what I've read and haven't loved:

**A Wicked Kind of Husband** by Mia Vincy - This was...fine, but it was my first encounter with the marriage of convenience trope and I realized I'm not a fan. I also didn't care for the dynamic between the two leads, FMC was too ""good"" and willing to ""fix"" the MMC too readily.

**One Good Earl Deserves a Lover** by Sarah MacLean - I wish I could tell you what I liked and didn't like about it, but it was one of those reads where I didn't feel much of anything. Someone really hyped up a smutty scene in here and it was a big letdown.

**Scandal in Spring** by Lisa Kleypas - I know this is everyone's least favorite in the series, but I tend to gravitate away from alpha leads, which I hear Kleypas' heroes tend to be. Honestly, I was LOVING the first 30% of this. Matthew Swift is one of my favorite romantic leads I've ever read, but then their feelings are resolved around the 50% mark (way too soon for this slow burn lover), and then a ridiculous far-fetched plot takes over towards the end. Really disappointed because the banter and dynamic at the beginning was really promising to me.

**Brothers Sinister** by Courtney Milan - I recently read The Governess Affair and enjoyed it, though it's only a novella and I much prefer longer stories. I wasn't completely won over by the two leads, but the plot was one I hadn't encountered before, and that hairpin scene was...HOT. I was excited to continue with The Duchess War, but I'm about 20% of the way in and it's just not grabbing me. I will definitely finish it, but I was so sure I'd love this series. There's just something about Milan's writing that isn't meshing well with me, I don't feel a spark between the characters.

**Do You Want to Start a Scandal** by Tessa Dare - Another one I've started and am not sure about. I love Dare's writing, but so far the connection between the two is developing a little too quickly for me.

If you've gotten this far in my drabble I thank you, because I am desperate. Please recommend any books, series, authors you think I might love. Some of the authors I've mentioned above seem to be the most recommended on here and like....is it me?? Am I the drama?? I don't think I'm the drama... \*cries\*

**TLDR;** Looking for historical romances/authors that I'll like. Things I really like: slow burn, modern themes and characters, MC's who aren't over-sexualized ass-hole rakes (can be a bit of a charming ass), FMC's who are independent and NOT naïve pushovers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/v7beoi/i_read_a_couple_hrs_and_loved_them_and_then_ive/,2022-06-07T23:48:11Z,61,22,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
heaow3,Zac from The Wall of Winninpeg and Me by Mariana Zapata is getting his own book!,"I haven't seen a post about it, so I thought I'd share! 

I'm so excited! please don't ban me, but I liked Zac a whole lot more than I did Winninpeg and I've been waiting for this book for so long

there's no exact release date but it's expected to release next month :D

here's the synopsis:

""Before he was Big Texas, he was Zac the Snack Pack.

Bianca Brannen knows time—mostly—heals all wounds. Including those your once loved ones might have unintentionally given you. (Those just take longer.)

She thinks she’s ready when a call has her walking back into her old friend’s life. Or at least as prepared as possible to see the starting quarterback in the National Football Organization. Before the lights, the fans, and the millions, he’d been a skinny kid with a heart of gold.

Waltzing out of Zac Travis’s life should be easy. Just as easy as he walked out of hers.""

I love a data project, and I had a super fun time last year compiling this [Best Romances of 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/r6eleo/best_of_the_best_romance_of_2021_lists/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) spreadsheet.  I started with all of the “best romances of 2021” lists I could find.  I put them together to see the overlap and make one mega-list of great books for the year.  Then, I read as many as I could before the end of the year - I think I ended up with 43 total out of 57.  

I already saw one list out from [Publisher’s Weekly](https://best-books.publishersweekly.com/pw/best-books/2022/), and I’ll check the same sources I used last year, but if you see a list I should include, let me know!  I’d particularly love to highlight lists including diverse reads or marginalized authors.  You can leave a comment if you see one, or shoot me a chat or DM.  I’ll share my 2022 spreadsheet as soon as I get a few lists on there, and keep adding as more lists come out.

woa9g0,Give me your best recommendations for “submissive”heroine,"So I’m kinda desperate. Idk what’s wrong with me but for abou 2 weeks every book I touch is a dnf😫 and I’m tired. Why? For me if I can’t relate with the heroine then I don’t like the book. I want a submissive heroine but not in a bdsm kinda way. I want for her just to not be bratty, mouthy or speaking before thinking and putting herself in dangerous situations bc of her stubbornness. I want a quite type of heroine. Who doesn’t complain and can have a conversation without being rude. Authors portrayed these heroines as bad ass but for me is not working😫😫 I want to but I just can’t. An example is Twisted emotions by Cora Reilly, the h is very sweet and kind. I like mafia romances but you can recommend anything except hr or rh. I hope I was very descriptive and I’m kinda desperate. 🙏 thanks

Edit: here is a list with books that i read (other than twisted emotions) who have this type of heroine:
Making Faces-Amy Harmon,
King’s Fancy,
Binding 13,
Trade-Catherine Miller,
Serpents touch,
Naked Edge,
Cry Wolf-Patricia Briggs,
Nikolai-Roxie Riverra (one of my favs),
Kiss an Angel,
Without Words-Ellen O’Connell,

u2wl8h,Unwanted Wife was a miss for me (A rant),"** I'm sorry if Unwanted Wife is your favourite book, It's just not mine. I hope my opinion doesn't offend you ** 

I wanted to read some angst and picked up Unwanted Wife because it has been recommended to me many times before.

At first I was hooked but the writing reminded me of my Wattpad fanatic era. I still pushed through but at a certain point, I was done with the FMC or maybe the story even. MMC clearly showed how he was changing but it felt like the author wanted FMC to drown in her sea of self-pity. 

When I was done with the book, I thought that I read fanfictions that are way better than the book.

Edit 1: 

I haven't read books with a lot of angst which is why I picked up The Unwanted Wife. 

Some fan fictions with a lot of angst are:

1. 10080; 

Summary: Chanyeol wanted a divorce. Baekhyun asked for a week.

(MxM) 

(This FF is an absolute legend. It's well written and by the end, you would definitely cry the hardest.)

🔗[Read here](https://exobubz.livejournal.com/929.html)



2. Anterograde Tomorrow; 

Summary: Kyungsoo is stuck in the hours while Jongin begs the seconds, because time stops for someone who can't remember and runs from someone who can't miss the last train home. 

(MxM) 

(This is a one shot and should be published as a book. It's so well written and structured, I'm surprised how the author didn't publish it yet and oh, you WILL cry) 

🔗[Read here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/25135804)



3. Even the midnights are better; 

Summary: Baekhyun, the son of the palace’s servants, has been waiting for the moment he discovers his soulmate. He just doesn’t expect his soulmate to be that particular crown prince who despises him ever since they were kids.

1agxrqo,Looking for Book Recs With a Great Cast of Characters to Help Me Through a Tough Time (No Grumpy/Sunshine or Pregnancy),"Hello! 

I’m a long time lurker, first time poster! Sorry if this is long! I am attempting to repost again with more detail in the title.

I am having a pretty rough time over here and could use some “easy reading” book recs. I have about a month to go before I have surgery for my endometriosis (so much fun!) and then I will have two weeks off for recovery. I’ve been stressed and anxious all while feeling pretty freaking horrible. So, I’m looking for some romance recs that will turn my brain off.  

**Some things I like:**

- I do love monster and fantasy romance. I really liked Kathryn Moon’s RH Tempting Monsters series. I know I’ve read a ton of other monster stuff, but nothing else is coming to mind. If you have a good werewolf rec I’d love to hear it! 

- Dark romances are usually the only contemporary romance I enjoy lol. Give me mafia arranged marriages, BDSM, the good stuff. I liked Den of Vipers, Her Soul for Revenge, Neva Altaj’s Perfectly Imperfect series, some of Jessica Gadziala’s mafia romances, and a smattering of MC romances.

- Clare Kent’s Hold and her dystopian series were fun for me. In fact I’ve been looking for another good prison or prison planet romance! 

- I put some work into Ice Planet Barbarians and Ice Home series Lolol. To help, my faves were Liz and Raahosh, Harlow and Rukh, Raven and U’dron and Devi and N’dek. (Edit to add: Strange Love is another alien romance that I absolutely loved. So funny and the characters were endearing and hilarious! This is the vibe I think I’m going for!)

I don’t know if that helps lol. **But here are things that are Nos for me:**

- Please no surprise pregnancies or even a big emphasis on pregnancy right now. Big trigger for me at the moment. 

- I’m a bit over grumpy/sunshine. Unless maybe the FMC is the grumpy one? How about a grumpy and grumpy? Or grumpy and angry? I don’t know, but I just feel like many sunshine FMC lately have been falling flat.

- I often struggle through or DNF books where the author is really bad at “show don’t tell.” Don’t *tell* me she’s quirky, *show me* please! And please let it be more unique than being clumsy and liking comics. 

That’s a whole lot of information to say that I am looking for an fun, brainless read with dynamic characters.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1agxrqo/looking_for_book_recs_with_a_great_cast_of/,2024-02-02T07:02:05Z,16,8,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST

z8a2yk,"Looking for ""Hallmark-like Christmas movies...but books"" that my partner can read to me as I fall asleep","# Context

I have trouble falling asleep and I often listen to audiobooks. However, when my partner is off work (seasonal) he will read to me!!   


He is super good at reading aloud, gives great expression to the character voices, and we can chat with each other about what he is reading. He also knows what I find funny, and will add in his own sentences or change character names without skipping a beat (to which I say ""It does NOT say that"" and he says ""yeah...it doesn't). In short — it's my favourite!

If the book is ""too good"" he gets too invested and is disappointed when I fall asleep/lie about falling asleep (""I'm awake!!"" I say to him — I don't realize I'm lying, in my defence). He finds himself wanting to read ahead without me.

Our solution? ***Books that are entertaining, but also are a tiny bit bad***. This way if I fall asleep, he can just give me a quick summary instead of actually re-reading chapters. We have been doing subpar horror novels (think: R.L Stein's Fear Street series) but with the Christmas season coming up he suggested reading ""Hallmark-like Christmas movies...but books"". 

# What Would Fit

  
**Christmas Themed (Obvs)**  
He knows about hallmark-like Christmas movies from watching movies such as [My Christmas Inn](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9058820/) and [The Knight Before Christmas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10060094/) with me during previous holiday seasons. We had a lot of fun watching those.

If you are familiar with those and have movies of a similar vibe — perfect! If you read something once where you said to yourself ""I bet my mom would love this"" — also perfect! It's just gotta have Christmas cheer!

**Something Clean or Low Steam**

He knows I am a romance fan, and I have been slowly educating him throughout our relationship that romance isn't just all about erotica or ""daydreaming about your dream man"" and that the attraction to the genre goes beyond that. Therefore I would like to slowly introduce him to the genre, and not get too ""weird"" too fast (if you know what I mean) so as to not have him be like ""but you said...""

  
He knows I read books with that type of content, but it just isn't what I want his first experience to be. We'll slowly work up to that.

  
**Not ""Actually Good"" but not ""Real Bad"" either**  
This is a fine line...but you know those books where it might not be a literary classic...or even a shining star of what a ""good romance book"" is — but you still read it cover to cover in one sitting, enjoying every minute? Kinda like that. Low stakes, fun, with room for silliness or unrealistic plot lines.  


For example, we will watch a bunch of cringey hallmark-like movies, but [Puppy Swap: Love Unleashed](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7159616/) was too much...we couldn't go forward with watching it.   


**Open to Different Genres/Tropes**  
Contemporary is probably the closest to hallmark-movie vibes as we can get. However, our go-to genres are sci-fi, fantasy, horror, historical, and mystery/thriller so those are more than welcome (as long as they don't get weird...no descriptions of alien peens or hulking orc bodies...he isn't ready for that, folks! No shade, I myself AM ready for that..just not him)

I feel like he enjoys a cinnamon role just as much as I do — think: Guillermo from What We Do in The Shadows) so bonus points for that!   


A character he doesn't like: ""A man's man"" — think: Agent Booth from Bones

The right amount of drama is: having to potentially go back to your Big City Job even though you fell in love with the local Pie Maker in the small town you visited over Christmas and he runs to the airport just as you are about to leave.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/z8a2yk/looking_for_hallmarklike_christmas_moviesbut/,2022-11-29T23:35:34Z,28,58,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
16zdpdr,MMM Two Wolf Shifters find their Human third - help me find it!,"This is a long shot, but I am shooting it!

Two werewolf shifters, living in a pack of other werewolf shifters.  They are best friends who love each other, and they would be together, but there is an issue around dominance.  I'm pretty sure the beta partner wanted to be dominant (which basically meant be the top in this book), so he wanted to be with an omega, not an alpha.  While the alpha was willing to be flexible, but could not be truly an omega for his love.

Then they meet a human man.  I *believe* he had just gone through a bad breakup.  I don't know if he knew about shifters before this, but they basically rescued him from something and brought him home with them.  He was the perfect third, as they both could top him.  Definitely references to how ""cute"" they found it when he moaned about how they were too big and it hurt :blush:

I *think* there is a scene at the end where they are on a beach together, and he is happy his ex will see pictures of him with his two gorgeous lovers.

It was a short,  quick read.  And I'm *pretty sure* it had almost a Harlequin-esque cover.  You know, when there is like a frame/banner.  So probably from one of those low budget presses that puts out a bunch of basic LGBTQ romance.  Like [this](https://www.goodreads.com/series/108330-luna-werewolves). I would definitely qualify it as romance, not erotica, because there was a relationship.  But it definitely was fun trash, not a deep, emotional read.

ph34i1,The Mindf*ck Series truly deserves its title for it has 'mindf*ck'ed me QUITE thoroughly... in a good way!,"It's an adult dark romance. **The Heroine is a serial killer and the Hero is a FBI Agent who** ***catches*** **serial killers...** he doesn't know the girl he thinks is *perfect* is actually the serial killer who tortures men and kills them heartlessly. SHE thinks he's pure and goodness personified and she will only continue to taint him with her darkness. She thinks of herself as a monster and feels as if being with him is the only time she manages to heal a part of her soul. 

Now, it IS a dark romance, which means it has some dark contents. There are vivid descriptions of sexual assault, gruesome torture. **There are a lot of trigger contents.**

You know, before reading this series, I never thought there would be a day when I would root for a *serial killer* to win. I did root for her. You want to know why? **Because she was a victim, once.** What happened to her... it's far too twisted  and dark to be able to put into words. Those men she tortures and kills? They *deserve* it. Trust me. They *absolutely* deserve it. It fact, they deserve *much* more. She was only 16 when it happened! I don't blame her for wanting to take revenge for herself and her family! **I never will! I am** ***not*** **ashamed to say that I ENJOYED reading about the torture she put them through. I smiled in glee when she** ***castrated*** **them.** 

Lana is a QUEEN and I love her! I have no idea how I'll go back to reading about the average heroines after her.... She ruined me, this series ruined me! **I am RUINED!** Oh God, is this what they call a **'Book Hangover'**? 

I know, I barely talked about the romance and the MMC but the thing is, the entire time reading this, I was far too invested in Lana's break in's and her torturing those men and the overall suspense. Romance is my favourite genre. I don't remember the last time I've been interested in anything more than that. This is not to say the romance wasn't good. It's just that, Lana has a great life outside of it!

sxtzoc,The Worst Guy by Kate Canterbury gave me all the feels and I might never get over this book,"Let me start off by listing the trigger warnings (taken from the author’s site) so I don’t suck anyone in only for them to realise they won’t be comfortable reading it!! Here are the content warnings: >!Chronic illness, absent/negligent parents, toxic/narcissistic family system, history of disordered eating.!<

It took me, like, 3 days to gather my thoughts enough to write this post and even now I’m still a jumbled ball of feels and thoughts but I’ll try my best to give a somewhat cogent argument for why you should read this book!!!

Tropes:

* Workplace enemies-to-lovers
* Grumpy (MMC) / sorta sunshine (FMC)
* Forced proximity (They are forced to go to therapy together and do team building activities together outside of work.)
* They run in the same social circle and their friends try to set the FMC up with another guy at a dinner party they are all attending and the MMC is super grumpy about it. >!(The FMC only talks with the other guy casually at the dinner party & the other guy is not a significant character in the book at all.)!<
* MMC is protective over the FMC but not obnoxiously so. He defends her more than once.
* The MMC falls first & recognises his feelings for the FMC before the FMC can come to terms with her own feelings.
* Hurt/comfort (They both feel unwell at different points in the book and the other comforts & takes care of them. They’re both surgeons.)
* They have hate sex.
* Dirty talking MMC & he calls her good girl
* There is also a scene with period sex

**Why I liked this book:**

Firstly, it was hilarious. It made me laugh but also gave me *all the feels*!!!! The MMC’s dry humour was kinda unexpected because of his grumpiness which makes him even funnier and more attractive!!! Also funny: the MMC’s name is Sebastian. I find all MMCs named Sebastian hilarious, even in CR books such as this one, because it’s the name of so many HR heroes. I digress. Anyway...

The MMC also says the **sweetest** things!!!! Examples:

1. >!“You could walk away from me now and take""—he slapped a hand to his chest—""everything I have to give and keep it with you as proof that you are deserving of all the love I have to offer.”!<
2. >!I wanted to show her off tonight. Stand in front of all of our friends, loop my arm around her waist, say, ""Do you see? This one's mine."" At the same time, I wanted to barricade us behind locked doors and under cozy blankets, press her hand to my chest, and say, ""Do you see? This one's yours.”!<

Furthermore, I related a lot to the FMC and all her baggage, self-esteem issues and unhealthy coping mechanisms. But she also showed me that you can be strong *and* dysfunctional, and strength doesn't always look pretty. The author put into words a lot of things I felt but could never quite verbalise. I especially related to this line: >!I still hadn't sorted out the contradiction inherent in desperately, desperately wanting to be deemed worthy—my pick me problem—and refusing to believe that anyone could ever want me because I was an epic mess.!< 

I think what really got me is that this book didn’t try to push the unrealistic fantasy that *love solves everything*, but instead gave me hope that there is someone out there who would love what you think are the most unlovable parts of you. Someone who would accept you for who you are instead of trying to save you or change you. That even people with baggage can find true love and what this love could look like!

I highlighted *the shit* out of this book and I can’t stop going back and rereading those parts (which is a large chunk of the book). I think Dr. Sebastian Stremmel (the MMC in this book) might be one of my favourite romantic heroes named Sebastian. He's definitely my current favourite Sebastian 😂",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/sxtzoc/the_worst_guy_by_kate_canterbury_gave_me_all_the/,2022-02-21T13:51:37Z,34,108,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
rvthrb,Danika Brown is pissing me off.,"I'm halfway through the book and I LOVE IT. It's so funny and the dialogue is really cute and entertaining, but Dani is getting on my nerves. Which is another thing I oddly appreciate because I'm used to flawless main characters so this is nice.

Anyway her reason for her aversion to relationships is just how she isn't willing to put effort into them so now when which ever significant other gets mad because she ignores them it's their fault. She's just too busy. I haven't gotten to the part that explains what Mateo did so maybe that'll shed more light to it.

This thing she said >!""I don’t have the necessary qualities to make a ‘good girlfriend.’ ” She made air quotes around the words, rolling her eyes as if that would hide the vulnerable edge to her voice. “I’m too work-focused. I don’t say the right things, or remember romantic little anniversaries. I find excessive affection obnoxious and I don’t enjoy putting other people’s priorities before my career and my family. These facts tend to disappoint prospective partners, and I’m too busy to deal with someone else’s disappointment or the punishment that comes along with it. So I avoid the dynamic altogether.”!< . Had me like?????? In real life how do you expect to build a relationship with someone if you keep them on the back burner, or at least don't achieve some sort of balance. It's like she expects people to be there for her without her having to put in any effort or give anything back. Anyway back to reading.

Trust me, friend-to-lovers is my least favorite trope. I hate arriving at a story where the point of conflict is “we know each other TOO well!! our lives are TOO intertwined!! we’re TOO perfect for each other!!!” like go post on facebook about it, I don’t want to read a full-length novel of this. 

Also, I know some people are like ‘ummm IDK if I could ever find a bald MMC attractive’. First of all, to each their own but you’re wrong. Second of all, FN mentioned that her headcanon for George is modeled after Mark Freaking Strong!!! so yeah, George is hot.

First of all, let me try to set up the premise:

* Phoebe, our darling heroine is literally just figuring stuff out as she goes!!
* George, a stern idiot who pretends to be super competent and serious but really actually thinks that the thoughts enter his brain more easily when his bald head is uncovered.
* They are lifelong friends. George literally helped Phoebe learn how to walk and throughout the years they’ve cultivated a sort of teacher-and-student dynamic.
* Phoebe recently got engaged and is kind of nervous about her lack of knowledge in how to make a husband happy. She thought she was going to die a spinster because no-one showed interest during her previous 4 seasons but got a proposal *from a Duke* out of the blue.
* Completely unrelated, George has been feeling out of sorts. Maybe since he heard the news. What could it possibly be?
* Disrupting his (neurodivergent levels of rigurous) schedule, Phoebe eschews their usual weekly chess dynamic and instead makes a wager with George: if she wins, he must teach her how to please her husband.
* George is disturbed but accepts. He gives it the old college try but he loses.
* They have sex.
* George discovers that actually, Phoebe is super hot and sexy and maybe she should marry **him** instead?
* Phoebe discovers that actually, having an orgasm is amazing and being married to a Duke will be fun. She thanks George and leaves.

THIS ALL HAPPENS BEFORE CHAPTER 5, PEOPLE!!! From here we are taken on a roller coaster of emotions and feelings so deep and complex that from the 50% mark I kept asking myself “is this about to become my favorite Felicity Niven novel???” over and over and over again.

Phoebe is just so delightful. She’s genuine and earnest to the point of being transparent which makes her fragile sometimes. But she’s So Brave! She wants to succeed in all she does and so she practices and goes for it and if she doesn’t get it she regroups and tries again. Throughout the novel we get to see how she grows and develops in real time (and once or twice during a flashback) and you can’t help but to feel endeared to a girl who feels so deeply and genuinely.

>Phoebe wondered why she had not argued she herself would not do anything improper. Because it’s not true. After yesterday, I’ve become a wanton. And I want everything.

&#x200B;

And George. He’s an idiot (affectionate) (but also derogatory). He is so set in his ways and routines that once he is jarred out of them he spends a lot of time blundering around and quite frankly fucking things up. But I was won over by his inner dialogue because he was so serious and deadpan but then he had a thought that had me going like “yep he’s an idiot and he’s a man”. An example:

>Even now, with no intention of dallying with this courtesan, he was glad she had breasts. They just made women so beautiful. A little crying was worth it, if it meant breasts. Like Phoebe’s.

He also had a lot of internal dialogue about how after that first time with Phoebe, he discovered that he loves having his bald head touched and I found it sooooo endearing:

>Nancy, she said her name was. She was quite lovely, with large, sympathetic eyes and a shapely bosom. But even more importantly, large hands. Perhaps if he lost Phoebe to Thornwick, he might come back to Madame Flora’s in defeat and ask Nancy to rub his head as consolation.

Most importantly: y’all know I live for a good grovel rec and I am pleased to say: this man GROVELS!!!! And he does it not once, but TWICE.

**OK HEAVY SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT:**

When I say he is an idiot I mean it. He literally negs Phoebe thinking it’ll bring her back to him if she thinks she’s not good enough for the Duke but by this point Phee has done some growing of her own and she realizes her own worth. She also realizes she’s been setting her wants and needs based on what she thinks other people think of her, especially George. So my baby girl picks up and leaves (**as she should!**) and George spends a lot of delicious chapters driven crazy with the need to have her forgiveness and her love. He’s like *I wish I had hair so I could RIP IT OUT.* He tries and he tries and he tries with mixed results because Phoebe does love him and she especially wants him! But she really believes that it’s been a little too late. But then >! her beloved father dies super unexpectedly and she literally goes catatonic with grief and she has sex with him just to feel something AND SHE GETS PREGNANT so they’re forced to get married but she’s SUPER UNHAPPY ABOUT IT !< . And these are chapters where you can feel both their sadness, grief and angst. It was nearly unbearable, I loved it.

Let me leave you with a quote from the very end so you can *feel* how much he loves her and cherishes her:

>“Shall we play chess? Finish our game on a real chessboard?”  
>  
> “No.” He gathered his wife into his arms. “I just want to hold you and look at you and whisper all my secrets to you.”  
>  
> “You have secrets?”   
>  
>“I don’t want them to be secrets anymore. I love you. I’ve always loved you. You’re the one who taught me love. You’re everything good in the world. You’re everything to me. You.”

137z47i,Rant about Anna Zaires’ Twist Me Series. (Spoilers included),"So I recently read Twist Me series and I just have to rant about a couple things, didn’t mind the dark, as I’m a lover of dark romance and a bit desensitized, but a few things did bother me.  First the fact that they couldn’t go no where for even a few days, without being attacked.  Did anyone else find this just a tad too much?  Like, I could understand with the one terrorist group, but then they happen into the club of Chicago’s crime families’ hunting ground for rape victims.  Was I the only one that felt like this was overkill?  Or did people enjoy this aspect?  I guess it was too much suspension of reality for me.  Thoughts? 

Next was Nora’s family.  Anyone else feel like this also was way outlandish?  How would you remotely be able to have dinner with the man who kidnapped your daughter?  Have him in your house?  As a mother to boys, this was just absolute nonsense.  My mom, dad, step dad would shoot him, before allowing that to happen. Are my parents odd?   Then throwing them into another over the top battle and making them see that Nora belongs with Julian now vs I don’t know, basically anything else.  Am I the only one who felt like this series just was too much on these ways?  I know it’s fiction, but I guess I still want it to have some actual realistic scenes, emotions, etc., within.   Guess I’m just not a fan of this series. But know I also didn’t hate, as I finished quickly, just found a bit overkill and outlandish in many ways.

10q07zw,Help me find carefree flirts or play dumb MCs!,"I am really in the mood to read some books with MCs who are carefree, flirty, and/or play dumb. 

I'm talking Therion from Bane by Bex McLynn. He is absolutely ridiculous, over the top, and plays dumb beautifully (read book one to fully appreciate him and the greater story arc). He is ""the bane"" of his families existence. He goes to great lengths to be seen as dumb but he's been scheming all along. He announces his plans to take over a whole base in such a joke way no one takes it seriously until he actually takes over.

Also look at Arc from Shielded Heart. He doesn't necessarily play dumb but he is over the top ridiculously flirty and jokey. 

I'm looking at you Halla from Swordheart. Halla has a tendency to be seen as a simple chattering woman to disarm, confuse, and distract those around her. Halla is very smart and conniving in her own way. She wants people to see her as dumb so she isn't a threat or she talks a merchants ear off to get them to sell their wares cheeper just to get her to leave. Thr MMC can't decide for the longest time if she's dumb or not, or if she genuinely doesn't know when a merchant is flirting with her or if her ""ignorance"" is ""Halla being Halla"". 

To an extent Taren from So I Accidentally Became an Alien Outlaws Mate with his carefree go with the flow nature is what I'm looking for. This man was naked as can be after killing a whole group of less than reputable people, MFC says before they leave something along the lines of "" should you cover that up"" indicating his dick, and he says more or less ""oh yea I suppose I should"" and looks around the room. 

Also to some extent Leila from Crown of Shadows. She has a plan and sees it through. She acts entirely ridiculous, jokes, and pokes fun at everything to break down barriers between her and her court (half human half fae picked by magic horses to be the next queen). People underestimate her and she uses it to her advantage, she never stops joking. 

Genre request: anything that isn't our normal human world as it is. Give me monsters, aliens, magic, fae, urban paranormal, sci fi, etc. Just no straight up normal earth stuff.

MF, MM, FF, MMF, RH, Non Binary; any and all gender makeups are welcome. 

Smut or no smut (though I do enjoy smut) is fine by me.

1arse86,Rut Bar by Alexis B Osborne : how feminism and consent kink made me love an OV story,"First, there is the title. Rut Bar? Really? I’m not an OV fan generally, and I don’t even know how I ended up looking past this title and deciding to read this incredible book.

I AM SO GLAD I DID!!!!!!!

Tags: MMMF, omegaverse, BDSM, praise kink, humiliation kink, dubcon

ETA: There is no cheating or OWD/OMD in this book. There is a short scene very early in the book where FMC walks in on MMC messing around with a woman, but FMC and MMC aren’t romantic yet they are just friends at that point. >!her reaction to walking in on them actually escalates her relationship with him and another MMC so it serves a purpose as a plot device too!< 

There is also an ongoing noncon behavior where >!an MMC puts cum in someone’s food without their knowledge.!< That’s discussed in the comments if you want a heads up about the details and how other readers felt about it

————-  

This post has some light spoilers uncensored i.e. who the pack members are and their relationship dynamics. This info gets revealed 20% into the book so not a huge spoiler but the surprise was fun so choose your own adventure ☺️

THE PLOT

Veronica is the owner of Rut Bar, a strip club that caters to omegas, with alpha dancers on stage a la omegaverse Magic Mike. She is an omega but has femdom tendencies and has been totally resistant to “normal” omega stuff, focusing instead on her business and an underground railroad for abused omegas that she runs through her bar. 

The Rut Bar is being audited by the IRS, and the agent assigned to the case is Brendan, a middle-aged alpha cinnamon roll daddy who suffered a sports injury in his 20s that traumatized him and left him with serious insecurities about his masculinity/alphaness. 

The other two MMCs are Anthony and Jamie. Anthony is a beta, with a tattoos and piercings punk/biker aesthetic, banter to die for, and a distinctly non-beta approach to sex. Jamie is a surfer golden retriever alpha but he is SUCH A SUB and has a lot of insecurity about it and some humiliation kinks to match. Anthony and Jamie are lovers, have an intense BDSM dynamic between them with Anthony as dom, and are also in love with each other and with Veronica although she doesn’t know that at first.

Anthony’s self-given mission as a beta is to pull together a pack within which Veronica and Jamie will feel comfortable being their true authentic selves and really letting go. With the addition of Brendan, the mission is a success.

Plot does occur, and it is decent plot, however 80% of this book is flirting, sex, or relationship talks.  The sex is kinky af and 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️


REASONS WHY THIS BOOK IS A MIRACLE AND A MASTERPIECE OF SMUTTY GENIUS 

Consent and communication on every page! 
>We get to read and hear about so many conversations between the MCs sharing their desires, fears, boundaries, and past experiences. 

>Every MC readily asks questions and actively seeks to understand the others better out of respect and care and a mutual commitment to consent. 

>Safewords are insisted upon by the dominant characters, and they check in A LOT with each other. 

>Honestly it seems like every time two of the MCs are really focused on each other, the other two are in the other room debriefing ☺️ 

>Extreme control and domination play are major themes but partner abuse is clearly defined and not tolerated! 

The A/B/O roles are all mixed up which is more realistic and makes space for really creative and hot dynamics!
>The FMC is technically omega but she Ds the hell out of surfer alpha boy and it’s his dream come true. 

>The big daddy alpha has self-emasculated and needs the beta to make him see how much he has to offer.

>Beta hottie is taking care of the alpha duties until big D gets on board, then is somewhat relieved to be off the hook from all that responsibility but also has to go through some feels to let go of the role

>Many, many combinations and configurations of who’s doing what to who, whose idea it was, and who is calling the shots.

The MM dynamics are loving, communicative, and fully developed!
>“Sword crossing” is fine by me but I rarely think MM scenes are hot. Turns out I must be demi for MM because the way these men speak to each other, and consider one another’s feelings and needs and boundaries is beautiful. 

>We get glimpses into the love that has been growing between Anthony and Jamie for years before the story’s beginning and I had so much feels for them both being misfits and how they found validation and safety and love with each other without a pack. 

>The daddy alpha identifies as slightly heteroflexible in the beginning and the way that develops into affection and 🔥between him and the other men actually reads like real human beings. 

(But they have knots on their dicks and sleep in a nest full of nasty blankets? How can all these things be true about the same book? My bias is showing but I’m having a breakthrough here so cut me some slack 🥹)

A whole new take on body positivity!
>Cinnamon roll daddy has a bad knee from a life-changing traumatic injury. Sometimes it hurts while they’re fucking. Sometimes he has to be careful about positions because the knee can’t hold weight. This is included on page alongside inferno level spice and it is not treated as a negative, it’s just how his knee is. 

>Surfer boy has angst about being an alpha who is the bottomist bottom ever. This part actually reminds me of the body betrayal trope that usually gets assigned to an omega, and the reversal of having an alpha MC who just wants to be used but his physiology wants to do alpha stuff and creates that expectation from others? 🤯

>Beta punk hottie is so 80% alpha he buys prosthetic tooth caps so he can be included in the claim-biting 😭 Seriously that last one made me cry, like is this a limb difference analogy? Gender affirming dental appliances?  Whatever it is it’s heartwarming and I want more.

Feminist alphas!
>Nobody at any point in the story suggests that FMCs omega status has any effect on her ability to run a business, and in fact by the end of the book both alphas and beta are literally her employees. 

>While the MMCs want her to be with them real bad and they do believe she will be happier, they don’t badmouth her choice to avoid omega stuff in the past and they make it clear that her life is her own. Even when talking about her when she’s not around, they don’t infantilize or patronize her

>Female  pleasure is prioritized in every scene that includes women 

>The whole concept of a club where alphas strip for horny omegas is pure gold

>FMC isn’t interested in having kids atm and draws a boundary that breeding talk is just talk. Period. Then puts the beta in charge of making sure she takes her bc every day, as an act of service. And he does. 😍

jrmlck,"You complete me; If you're a bird, I'm a bird; You jump, I jump right?","So this year I started reading romance books. I had dabbled before with popular titles (mainly books turned movies) in the past but my main jam was sci fi, dystopian novels. Early this year someone rec'd The Hating Game in my personal book club on FB and the rest is history.

With 2020 being a flaming pile of horse shit, my kid not being able to do in person school and a complete disconnect from my friends and family (living in different states) ... I've really, really retreated into my own head. I wasn't doing so hot.

Fast forward to two months ago (give or take) I reactivated my long dormant reddit account and found this sub. And it's been a GIFT.  Sometimes you guys are the absolute ONLY adult conversation I have in a day... in a week even... and it's made ALL the difference.  I don't care that it's online and I'll never have faces to go with the usernames.  I've made ""friends"" here and have never felt weird about posting. I've also found so many great authors I wouldn't have found without the help of this sub.

So thanks for the conversations and the laughs! I'm still a dumpster fire of a human being but internet friends help quite a bit!  


P.S. I've never noticed how weird the word ""jump"" looks when I type it out... I second guessed myself on the spelling... of the word... JUMP.

182ewbe,Haunting Adeline and Hunting Adeline messed me up,"(Spoilers ahead)

Yes I know, stalker romance with non-con, human trafficking, murder, death, kidnapping, and so much more. It’s a lot. I knew beforehand that it was a lot. But it was still a lot, and it still fucked me up a little. 

Haunting Adeline (4/5) was good, I liked it. When I first got it I couldn’t stop reading for awhile, I read the first 220 pages in a day because I was so captivated by the stalker plotline. It was thrilling and captivating and spooky, I loved it. The diary entries from Gigi and the mystery behind her murder was also surprisingly intriguing to me, though I am a little disappointed at how that storyline ended. 

However, the last half of the book isn’t great imo. After the second time Zade assaults Addie, the book loses some of its edge. They text regularly and even talk irl, during which they seem to be more playful than before. Any resistence Addie had seems to only be playful, aside from that one time in the woods. It just seems like they enter into a more traditional D/s relationship, just with free use and without a safeword. 

And the trafficking plotline was just not interesting to me. A lot of it was pretty ridiculous and yeah I know, suspension of disbelief and all that, but that can only go so far. Some of the scenes were extremely uncomfortable too, for instance when Zade was offered a five-year-old girl and he had to pretend to be a pedo to not blow his cover. I get they’re bad people and that bad things happening in a book isn’t valid critique in and of itself, but I just wonder if some of these scenes were really necessary and if making some of the girls literal toddlers was necessary. Would’ve been an easier read you know? 

Overall I enjoyed it, but it had its problems. Still, I bought the second one because the ending had me hooked. 

And fuck me, Hunting Adeline (4/5) was way worse. The first half was extremely difficult to get through. I read Part I in a day because while it was hard to read, I found it impossible to put the book down while Addie was still in that house. It was so uncomfortable to read how she and the other girls were treated and some points nearly made me break down into tears. A good example is Phoebe’s death. Another is the simple line: *Two months later*, which made me internally weep for Addie. 

Zade hunting her down was easier to read, so much so I was relieved whenever a chapter of his was coming up and I dreaded every time a chapter was from Addie’s pov. Still, I think some of Zade’s decisions were a little odd. For instance, teaming up with the Brotherhood, because one of the leaders literally had a girl on a leash, which as far as I remember was never resolved. His encounter with two of the girls from the house was a satisfying moment, both because they were free and because now Zade had more information to go on, including finding the house. 

Addie’s escape was extremely nervewracking, my heart was pounding so fast. I literally murmured *Please be careful* the moment she went for the door and dropped one of her bottles. It was a good suspense, though, and it was equally terrifying when she was in the train carriage, alone and freezing, and hearing voices from outside. Her reunion with Zade was what finally broke me, though. 

But Part II is… again a little eh. I loved when they were hunting down her abusers and torturing them to death, it was extremely satisfying (aside from Claire, who went out too quickly imo). That said, I wanted to scream at Zade at points. He was such a dick to Addie at several points, particularly when discussing Rio. Addie went through trauma that she will probably never get over and Zade is still berating her at times and talking about rape and abuse like it’s the most natural thing in the world. Only good thing I can say about his behaviour is that at least he didn’t rape her during this time (which was not a given). 

Overall, I enjoyed the duet, but it has some problems. I fucking LOVED the stalker plot in Haunting, it was incredibly captivating to me. But it just lost the plot in the second half. The second book was good too, but Part I fucked me up. I don’t think I can ever read a romance involving third party abuse again. 

One issue with both books is Zade. He’s a hypocrite. I get what the author was going for, like *oh he’s a stalker but he also saves women and children from traffickers*, which is a cool premise, but it didn’t quite hit the mark for me. Zade comes off as a hypocrite and an asshole, not as a morally grey intriguing hero. I just think it would’ve been a lot better had the author fully leaned in on the depravity of the stalker plot and cut out the trafficking stuff. If I could change Haunting, I would make it 200 pages shorter and have it focus on the stalking stuff and reel back the trafficking stuff. 

4/5 stars for both books and the duet as a whole. Despite my issues with the duet, I enjoyed it (well, *enjoyed* is the wrong word for Part I of Hunting) and I will definitely read more from H. D. Carlton.

here’s the thing, i have most definitely seen this book recommended to me on KU before, and know that i’ve passed up on it several times at this point. it was only upon seeing the recommendation that i decided i wanted to give it a try. i know the title had the words “mail order bride” in it, and i think it may have been an alien romance? that’s what i’m currently leaning towards bc of my memories of it having been suggested to me so many times on KU, and i’ve kinda been on an alien romance kick haha. i also want to say that the cover had a picture of one of those big buff shirtless men, and he was holding a woman across his chest i think, and i think one of them may have had white hair (???)

someone please end my torment and let me know what book this is if you know what i’m referencing. and while you’re at it, let me know if it’s actually worth the time i’ve dedicated to trying to find it, or should i have just followed my first inclination and saved myself all of this frustration (also, if anyone has any other recs let me know too! i’m always looking for new romance books).",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/w07evv/someone_please_help_me_find_this_mail_order_bride/,2022-07-16T03:54:32Z,14,9,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
r5oak8,‘Tis the season for Kringle tingles: a review of Santa Claus Is Going To Town On Me,"There is nobody in real life I can gush about this book with, but if anyone will appreciate it - it’s this sub!

The book in question is of course [Santa Claus Is Going To Town On Me by M.L Eliza (aka Marie Lipscomb)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58830350). 

97 pages of delightfully festive Santa erotica and available on KU. I’m not sure how much of a spoiler warning is required for a smutty novella but some of my points below may give things away so consider yourself warned. 

I’m a big fan of Marie Lipscomb’s writing and her heroes are always big, burly and beardy so Santa smut does make sense. 

The story centres around the fittingly named Holly, our Christmas-hating (thanks to some childhood trauma CW for >!death of a parent!<) FMC, who’s woken up one night by the big man himself delivering presents (he got the addresses wrong, which is a thing that happens despite him being a supernatural being that can deliver billions of gifts in one evening). Plenty of super steamy Santa sex ensues…

Some of my favourite elements:
- The phrase ‘he gives me the Kringle tingles like I’ve never felt before’
- His cum tastes and smells like peppermint (and it’s shimmery) 
- Claus (rhymes with house not pause, thank you very much) can also make toys of the adult variety 😉
- He can also hear all your desires and whilst I can see how that could be problematic (and this is nicely dealt with in the story), also sounds like the hottest thing imaginable. 

To conclude, a surprisingly sweet festive treat and I’ll never look at Santa the same way again.

So I'm at 67% , she's in Maine with Jesse

Overall, I like this book, but this is bothering me

Her I thermal dialogue constantly about how much she has changed

JUST TALK TO HIM

It seems like an obvious fix , tell him you don't travel and why, tell him you're happy at the bookstore and that's where your life is now and see what he things instead assuming he is also the same person from 3 years ago

It's likely he doesn't want to do all the things he did before either it's likely he also had to grow up a lot while he was missing 

Its bugging me! She's being borderline upright and pretentious about how much she has changed

xwim9y,Anyone want to read The Right Swipe by Alisha Rai with me?,"Alisha Rai is coming for an AMA in a few weeks, and I love her books!  I’m doing a reread of some of my favorites, does anyone want to buddy read The Right Swipe with me?  The book is available at a lot of libraries and on Hoopla too!

Here’s the blurb - *Rhiannon Hunter may have revolutionized romance in the digital world, but in real life she only swipes right on her career-and the
occasional hookup. The cynical dating app creator controls her love life with a few key rules: - Nude pics are by invitation only - If someone stands you up, block them with extreme prejudice - Protect your heart Only there aren't any rules to govern her attraction to her
newest match, former pro-football player Samson Lima. The sexy and seemingly sweet hunk woos her one magical night... and disappears. Rhi thought she'd
buried her hurt over Samson ghosting her, until he suddenly surfaces months later, still big, still beautiful- and in league with a business rival. He says he won't
fumble their second chance, but she's wary. Temporary physical partnership is one thing, but a merger of hearts? Surely that's too high a risk...*


If you’ve never done a buddy read before, I’ll set up a Reddit chat for us.  We’ll divide the book into sections and read on an agreed-upon schedule, discussing as we go.  It’s fun!

tzw2fs,Restore Me by J.L. Seegars,"Okay, I searched the sub for this to see if anyone else has talked about this book, but it seems it's being slept on!

I finished this book almost 3 weeks ago, and I'm still thinking about it.

It's a chonky book at almost 500 pages. This is usually an automatic no for me, but I'd seen it raved about on Twitter and was intrigued. I do think there were a few areas that could have been a little tighter/condensed, but generally, I will DNF when I'm getting bored and didn't DNF this. Getting through a near 500 page book for me is a rarity.

There's ANGST and yearning in this book, but there's also a LOT of spice.

It's about a grieving widow (Sloane) falling for her late husband's best friend (Dominic) despite the fact that she's hated him for years--and he's hated her just as fiercely, except...maybe...he hasn't hated her at all. They're not coworkers but end up working on a mutual project together, which causes them to spend more time together. That, plus a night out with mutual friends where he intervenes when another guy gets handsy with her, starts to change the dynamic in their relationship.

When she confesses to him that she's touch-starved, he offers to help her out for the length of their work project. She thinks it'll help her move on from her touch starvation, as well as get him out of her system (because there's no way she could ever pursue something serious with him, but we all know how well the Getting It Out Of Our System thing works in romance novels), but he's made it his mission to convince her to be his before the end of the agreement.

Little snippet:

>!Both of my hands come up, landing on Dominic’s chest and extracting a surprised hiss from his lips as I shove him. He backs away, and I don’t even bother feeling triumphant at breaking the moment because I know I was only able to move him because he allowed me to. I pull my dress down as much as I can before glaring at him.!<

>!“You don’t give a fuck about my well-being. If you did you wouldn’t have spent the better part of the week acting like I didn’t exist after… ” !<

>!“After you ran out on me.” !<

>!His words are vicious, biting into my skin with their truth. I did run out on him, but that doesn’t mean it’s okay for him to ice me out. !<

>!“I was upset, and anyone with eyes could see that. I mean is there some rule against being embarrassed about not having a handle on my skin hunger and losing it at work with my husband’s best friend of all people? God, Dominic—” !<

>!“Not having a handle on your what?” His brows furrow as he stops me mid-rant, and I feel myself turning the color of my dress when I realize what I just said. Talking about my skin hunger with him, or anyone that isn’t my therapist, feels like a new kind of nightmare. We stare at each other, and I know he’s waiting for an explanation just as surely as I’m waiting for him to be enough of a gentleman to forget I ever said those words. One look at him tells me that’s not going to happen though. !<

>!“Skin hunger,” I repeat, steeling myself for the moment when he bursts into laughter and makes me feel like even more of a fool. But it doesn’t come. Instead, Dominic looks at me expectantly and gestures for me to continue. “My therapist said it’s also referred to as touch starvation, and it’s something a lot of people struggle with when their spouses die, and they go from having regular physical contact, like hugs, cuddles and sex, to not having any meaningful touch for long stretches of time.” !<

>!“I see,” Dominic says quietly, his fingers flexing like my admission is his personal call to action and he’s barely containing the urge to put his hands back on me. “And this is something you struggle with?” !<

>!“Yes. Hence the whole dating thing.” Goddammit, Sloane! It’s like I can’t keep my mouth closed. Dominic’s eyes darken at the mention of my date and the suggestion that I’m using Ash for cuddles, or worse, sex. “I didn’t mean it like that. I mean, it’s not like I’m using him…” !<

>!“Use me.” !<

>!“What?” I sputter, even though I heard him loud and clear. “Use you? For what?”!<

>!“To take care of your needs. You said your skin is starved for touch. Use me to sate your hunger.”!<

Like, excuse me, how am I not supposed to DIE reading that?

Something I really loved about this book is that it felt realistic - both characters really struggle with their feelings for each other, believing they're betraying their late husband/late best friend. However, there's such respect paid to Eric (the late husband/late best friend). There's a lot of talk about what would have happened if the timing had been different for Sloane and Dominic, if she'd never ended up with Eric, but also so much understanding that he was a great love for her and she doesn't regret that, even if it>!might have delayed her relationship with Dominic.!< It's a really interesting look at grief, but also moving on while still honoring the love and relationship that was lost when a partner dies.

One thing I will say is both characters have immensely complicated relationship with parents, so if that's a trigger for you, this might be upsetting. Sloane's mom, in particular, is actually the devil. There's a trigger warning at the beginning of the book that includes other triggers, but I think the warning includes ""domestic violence"" instead of parental abuse, so just some FYI there.

v9fgic,"As someone who has read nearly every Sarah J Maas book out there, House of Sky and Breath has me STRUGGLING to finish it. *semi rant, no spoilers*","Alright y’all. It started with Throne of Glass, and I INSTANTLY fell in love with SJM. I’ve ready every ToG book at least three times, absorbing the details, falling in love with the characters (Rowan is love, Rowan is life). COTAR? Same thing. (If you don’t picture Henry Cavill for Rhys, you’re wrong)
But the Crescent City books….

I’ve read Crescent City three times, but not for the same reason. I HAD to read it so many times to try to absorb all the details because there are SO. MANY. So many lines and tangles and things going on. I love the dialogue, Bryce is the sassy queen we all wish we could be, but I just can’t get into the story line of this series because it’s constantly jumping. I struggled through it. 

House of Sky and Breath is worse. My first attempt. I got 1/3 of the way through the book before I gave up. I’m listening to the audiobook now, which is better, but I don’t know if I’ll ever re-read it out of love. 

The thing that bothers me the most is that everything is a coincidence. It feels like SJM went “oh and then this should happen”, wrote it, figured out it doesn’t really work with the story, and then just wound a unbelievable reason to explain it away afterwards. Oh. And maybe it’s just because I’ve read the others so many times, but there are so many of the same ideas… one example, winnowing and teleporting - she even uses the exact same description for the two. Without giving any spoilers, I can go through and be like “oh yeah that’s the same idea as what happened in _____”
Bryce’s reason for getting into all of this shit is weak, too. (Referring to Danika, not the other reasons). 

Idk you guys - I hope someone sort of feels the same way as me because I’m really disappointed, but I know so many people who think it’s the best book she has written. 

Wish me luck as I get through the last 3 hours of the book!

sfszlp,It took me three tries to finish the Kate Daniels series because they tried to make every book a stand-alone.,"Let me preface by saying, I love Kate Daniels. The world building, the characters - Kate has an excellent arc, Curran is amazing, and the side characters are fleshed out and numerous - the plot. It’s all very well done, interesting, and unique. Kate is one of my favorite MCs of all time, and I haven’t yet found any other urban fantasy that holds a candle to this series. 

That being said… how many freaking times are they going to tell me about the different factions of the city, how the magic waves work, and the crumbling ruins of Atlanta??? I understand that each book has its own little wrapped up mini-plot, but by the end of the series it’s kind of crucial to have read all of them. These aren’t like actual standalone series where you have a different couple in each inter-connected book. If I tried to read book 8 without reading the rest of them, half of the excellent jokes would go over my head and I wouldn’t understand the significance of half the plot. 

The first time I read the series, I quit after book 4 because of the unnecessary summarization. The second time, I got to book 7 and put it down after reading nearly the exact same description of Curran’s “coiled strength that could explode at any moment” for the umpteenth time. I had to take a break for several months and read other things before I could come back and finish it.

With every book, there’s more and more summarization that has to be done to catch you up, so it’s just exhausting by the end. Also, I’m not good at skimming. It’s very difficult for me not to read every single word. If they really wanted to make them standalones, I wish they just had a little section at the beginning of “things you need to know if you haven’t read the other books”, so I could just skip it. 

To be clear, I’m not against a little reminder here and there. For example, if there’s a riddle or detail we get in the first book that becomes significant in the second, yes, please do remind me. But in these books they restate the absolute basics of everything, and it drove me nuts. 

Anyways, that’s my rant about Kate Daniels. No hate to Ilona Andrew’s, I love their work, and I’m very much looking forward to reading more about Julie and Derek when they get around to it.

1387lvi,Can anyone help me find this Western romance novel? Help!,"I'm trying to remember the title of a Western romance novel I read a few years ago and I'm hoping someone can help me identify it. The book is set in the American West during the 1880s and features a wealthy rancher named King (or something that starts with a K, maybe that's his nickname or last name). King is dating a debutante named Olivia (?), but his feelings for the young heroine make him question his relationship.

The heroine is being pressured by her father to marry King's younger brother (possibly named Adam), but she likes King instead. I think the father is suffering from some sort of disease that makes him act more aggressively to his daughter than he used to. She says, that she remembers him as a kind and gentle father before all of this. I think he's also an investor or banker and he is trying to get the Hero's family as a client. Near the end of the book, the father goes on a hunting trip and gets a head injury, but later beats his daughter to the point of her almost death. The local priest knew that her father was abusive to her and was trying to get her to get help. The heroine is very religious and can't save herself because she feels guilty because her father used to be a good and kind man.

The book also includes a subplot where King is dating a woman who only wants him for his money, named Olivia. The heroine may have had a brother who went and joined the army or Texas Rangers, and possibly other siblings who had died in a flood or something.

If this description sounds familiar, please let me know the title and author of the book. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1387lvi/can_anyone_help_me_find_this_western_romance/,2023-05-05T02:16:29Z,2,6,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
n309kc,I just finished Lemonade and I LOVE how it hurts me,"Lemonade by Nina Pennacchi
Took me like a week and finally I finished this book. When I first heard about this book I didn’t think I would like it. That’s why it stayed in my Kindle for like a year. I am a fan of light fluffy romance and the book I read before Lemonade was the 6th or 7th of Ice Planet Barbarian so you know my normal taste. 
The first 1/4 of the book was fun and reminded me of Pride and Prejudice and if only it stayed like that... but that would be a much different and boring book. From about 1/3 into the book it took a sharp dark turn and started to hurt me like nothing else. I felt the helpless pain of the heroine and at the same time, the insanely deep deep love of the hero. The painful sweet bitterness almost got me depressed ( my excuse to eat more chocolate)  and even nightmares. 
The hero was a real villain! Not those villain masks covered cinnamon buns that pretend to be bad but actually good inside guys. Also, interestingly , he’s not a unreasonable evil a- hole that’s like to abuse just because. You know where his anger came from- but that dose not make him a good guy. 
The heroine is so strong, I got Stockholmed before she did, if she got any. It was devastating to see how she got destroyed piece by piece until there was almost nothing left. 
The ending only left me wanting for more, it can easily became a trilogy, but guess that was not a popular thing back when this book was published. 
Overall a very well written book with rich side characters. I personally strongly recommend it, also there’s strong Non- con alert. Not a typical happily ever after ending.  
Guess I’m gonna have the hang over for a while. Maybe I should read more Ice Planet Barbarians as a pain killer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/n309kc/i_just_finished_lemonade_and_i_love_how_it_hurts/,2021-05-02T05:58:28Z,7,35,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
prb79g,Help me get into the forced snuggling at the beginning of Managed by Kristen Callihan,"I bought the audiobook of Managed by Kristen Callihan so I would definitely like to finish this but I had to stop last night during Chapter Three because the forced snuggling on the plane elicited such a strong reaction from me that made me feel like I was nuts because this is such a popular book and I don’t think I’ve read anyone bring up these qualms before (specifically in this sub, which I think is really great at calling out genuinely problematic scenes). 

Anyway I’ve loved all the writing and characterization so far but when Sophie, a stranger, takes it upon herself to snuggle the MMC while he’s literally paralyzed in fear over the turbulence, it felt like such a huge, inappropriate invasion of space. I know this tactic to calm him down does eventually work (I actually haven’t gotten there yet but I’m sure it does), but it still seems like such a strange violation that he tried to ward off multiple times. 

When she first touches his shoulder, he says “Go. Away” but she persists, saying “I can’t” before crawling over to cuddle him. When he asks in shock what she’s doing and she answers “cuddling” he says, “What? No,” which seems pretty clear as a refusal and a lack of consent now. 

In the narration she says “I normally would never force this on someone but he’s already focused on me instead of the turbulence” which feels dicey as a justification for forced touching because if you’re engaging in some sort of non-consensual activity the person you’re forcing it on is obviously going to be reacting with enough shock to be distracted from the other issue at hand. 

Then she makes jokes about copping a feel of his body while rubbing his chest and I just couldn’t stop imagining this situation with the genders reversed. I feel like it’d be much more clearly inappropriate if a man coerced a vulnerable woman into snuggling him and letting him touch her body.

Am I taking this too literally? I’m usually great at suspending disbelief and understanding that in books, this is meant to be the *one* time this circumstance is going to be forgiven (i.e Bass Ackwards and Mutually Beneficial, which I loved) but I’m having so much trouble getting over this instance of forced touch/snuggling because it’s not presented as this dark, twisted situation but rather something cute and sweet.

I would really like someone to help me get over myself because I know I’ll enjoy this book once I’m past this part! But if there is anyone out there who felt this way too please let me know as well because I do feel like I’m losing my marbles a little. Thank you so much and sorry in advance if I’m clearly being too sensitive.

Enter the H, also a college student, who agrees to pay her rent/give her funds in exchange for having a physical relationship with him.

xfvh0l,The Lady's Mine by Francine Rivers left me...speechless and hopeful and just happy.,"This is my first gush post, but I just had to. The Lady's Mine was released in February and it's never been mentioned once on here, at least based on my search.

So I'll address the Christian romance part first. I'd never read Christian fiction before, as I'm not very religious, or even Christian for that matter. Faith was an aspect of the story, but in a way that felt seamless, like it was integral to some characters and their motivations. It never felt unnecessarily pushed on the reader. Also, this was a closed door romance.

But moving on to the gush part.

Setting: 1875 Californian mining town, a small one.

Heroine: Kathryn Walsh. The star of this story. Now she's a heroine you can root for - human in the face of hardships, but kind, courageous and intelligent nonetheless. It's because of her that this book feels hopeful and positive throughout in spite of what seem like insurmountable odds sometimes. One of my biggest pet peeves is a heroine who is described as plucky and smart, but ultimately leaves you questioning her illogical actions. IMO, Kathryn didn't always do the most prudent thing, but her decisions made sense based on the information available to her.

Hero: Matthais Beck. Now this was an alpha hero in pursuit. He was pushy and protective at times. But as the book progressed, his protective streak was tempered by the realization that Kathryn's independence was integral to her. He was a pining hero that was truly willing to hitch his wagon to Kathryn's star.

Also: OUTRAGEOUS chemistry. I haven't seen that kind of chemistry in a while, even in books that have plenty of sex on page. Lots of banter too.

There's so much more that I want to say about this book, but I don't have the words at the moment. This book was 450 pages, but it still felt too short. I wanted it to keep going.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/xfvh0l/the_ladys_mine_by_francine_rivers_left/,2022-09-16T16:10:12Z,9,19,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
uheqxy,"Could someone help me ID a romance book, please? Or the author who wrote what I remember?","This was a Highlander romance novel,  about a Laird who married an English woman. In order to protect their  daughter's ""virtue,"" this woman's parents sent her to a convent when she  was a small child. Due to an emergency of the estate, the wedding was  held at the convent, and the two older women who were chosen to lecture  the bride about her new marriage duties had been in the convent since  they were small children and knew *nothing*.

None  the wiser, the Laird takes his new bride home where they have a great  feast, the wedding couple adjourn upstairs to consumate the marriage,  and the Laird calls a halt to everything when he realizes this little  English bit he married knows nothing. He calls for his mother to give  her ""the talk,"" and goes downstairs to drink with his men. His men think  that his, *ahem*, manhood wasn't up to the task and take it upon themselves to drug him with the medieval equivalent of Viagra.

He  goes back upstairs, trips over a luggage chest, smacks his head against  the headboard so hard that he passes out, and she quickly turned him  over to make sure he was still breathing. Despite being out cold, he was  still *ahem* standing at  attention. Curious about this appendage she's never seen before, the new  bride reaches out and grabs it--only for it to shoot off and go soft.  Her new mother-in-law had impressed the need for this appendage to go  inside her, but that didn't work while he was soft.

Panicked,  she calls for her mother-in-law. Who comes in, surveys the scene,  laughs, then gets her ladies to come help. As the new bride stares in  shock and mystification one of the women pulls a dead chicken out from  under her skirt, slits the chicken's neck, and sprinkles blood on the  sheets. When she asks what that's about (natural question), she gets pat  on the head and told, ""You'll understand on your true first night."" The  women take the sheets and parade them around downstairs.

It  takes about a week for the Laird to heal, and then he's eager to take  (and remember taking) his new wife (who was surprisingly--or not so  surprisingly--competent at running a keep). She's also eager for this  and tells her husband that she has to go ""prepare.""

Eager to see what his wife is doing he rushes through his chores, goes back to his room, and enters it--

\--just in time to see his wife wringing the neck of a chicken.

gjxtlm,Update on my ‘Please help me find a book as funny as What Happens in London’ thread.,"Hey guys. This is an update on my “Please help me find a book as funny as What Happens in London” thread. 

I haven’t had great results (for wholly personal reasons) but I still felt really bad not updating you guys on how it’s going however disappointing my results would be to you. I mean I was so utterly pathetic and desperate sounding (still sorta am) when I made that thread.

Here’s the lowdown. I’d tried a couple of the HRs and one nonfiction humor. 

And the (temporary) verdict is:

Well speaking plainly, nothing is making me laugh. (Before you boo me off the stage let me explain)

I tried about six of the HRs, I knew the parts with *my* kind of humor that I would have been laughing or chuckling at, I could SEE those parts with my own two eyeballs, and it was so frustrating that I *wasn’t* laughing. (For clarification, I mean organic laughter. Not self induced laughter).

So then, (shameful confession) I tend to self induce laughter (ugh).. so I did some of *that* (which honestly makes me feel like a pathetic loser after a while but whatever, it’s way better than nothing and makes you feel good 🤦‍♀️😅). 

I knew something was wrong at that point. 

So I rewatched four of some of my favorite comedy films ever. Just to see wtf was going on. Aaand.. I only had some smiles, that too only at the most humorous peaks. Literally. 😐 When with one of them, I’m usually laughing so hard that it literally hurts and I’m in *tears*. (Also just an observation, I found that self inducing laughter with moves/tv shows is much harder than books)

Back to the point, originally I thought the reason why everything was going over my head was due to my (temporarily) abnormal sleeping patterns, but my sleeping patterns have sorta normalized a bit now, and still nothing.

But I want you guys to understand it’s not it’s not *you*, it’s *my* sense of humor that’s wonky tonky. Sorry for the TMI but basically, I’m having a rough patch right now. Please don’t worry, it’s not quarantine/COVID related, and these episodes come and go.

What kinda sucks is that that was the very reason I was so desperate to find a quick fix book to make me laugh, but it’s also the same exact reason why these quick fix books are *not* making me laugh and I’m left with this 😐 kinda face. Oh well. But at least silly videos like SNL, Late Night Shows, and certain stupid reddit threads are doing it for my somewhat shortened attention span right now. 😊 (for example, anyone here frequent r/Askmen and only recently discovered the phrase “[chucklefucks](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/gapp1o/dont_use_the_askmen_chat/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)?” for the first time? 🤣 totally going in my repertoire). 

I’m still extremely happy I snatched up the opportunity and made this thread *during lockdown*, because I got so many actually funny suggestions from people who may not be on here to make recommendations once it’s all over. Some of those books were quite unknown to me at least. The last times I’d made threads about WHiL, they were nowhere near as successful as this. This was fantastic. I know that the ones that I’ve tried so far are probably going to be great additions to my comedy TBR, based on the style of humor. 

For those of you who said you want to follow that thread because you enjoyed WHiL and are also trying to find something as funny: even though I haven’t had great results *yet*, bookmark that thread and try some out yourself. It’s a good thread.

The kind hearted, compassionate souls who promised to read WHiL so that they could recommend something as funny to me, you are all relieved from that request (not that you should have ever felt obligated to but yeah). Thank you so much for offering. And to those who’ve already read it at my request, and subsequently suggested a book to me based on your experience of reading it, you guys are just *awesome*. (Because of that, one of the books I was suggested was Mary Roach’s Mission to Mars, and boy is the sarcasm off the charts). 

Thank you guys, and I’m sorry I couldn’t bring more exciting news, but it’s all on me. ❤️❤️❤️

TDLR: feeling like shit, affecting my attention span and sense of humor greatly, not finding books funny right now, but don’t worry, the several of the HRs I tried had a couple of instances which were my kind of humor and I know I’m going to enjoy them eventually. Please forgive me.

Edit: this sub is the kindest sweetest thing 😘. I’m amazed that even at this size the wholesomeness is so well preserved. I know I’m not the only one in a ditch right now.

yj8xmj,Help me find books similar to Loving War by C.M Owens,"Sorry if this has already been asked, but I tried searching with the magic button putting in different wording but nothing came up so I'm giving it ago here as I've always got great recommendations from you guys before! 

So, I have just finished Loving War, part of the Sterling Shores series by C.M Owens and I wasn't sure about it at first tbh but I actually really enjoyed it!
So much so,  I'm now on the hunt for similar books with the same vibe as this one....

• I need my MC to really show her its her he wants, maybe he has overlooked the FMC time and again in the past so she doesn't believe him when he says it's her he wants.

• I want him to really fight for her. Even If she keeps shutting him out through insecurity

• I'm happy with angst and some heartache 

• And I don't want her to just roll over - Can't stand doormats in my romance books! Doesn't need to go on and on but I don't want him to just say afew words and she just accepts it.


I have already read The Something In The Way Series by Jessica Hawkins but can't remember any others that have really stood out to me!

zb843g,Bored of 6-pack abs? Tired of monstrous size differences? Yawning over spurs and other alien accouterments? Let me introduce you to the next generation of alien/monster boyfriends - gelatinous sentient KY jelly blobs.,"I came here to gush. I have been in such a book slump - I’ve DNF’d more books over the last two weeks than I have the entire year. I randomly came across this book after an author I follow gushed about it in her newsletter. Intrigued, I borrowed it off of KU and straight up devoured it! 


Dear men, you have a new impossible standard to meet - gelatinous blobs that have the ability to take on any corporeal form. Ladies, let me introduce you to your next cinnamon roll, possessive, and protective boyfriend, Lux. He’s an unassuming blob in the streets, passion-consumed empath in the sheets. 


You can find him in {Amorphous Love by Jeannette Lynn and Meri Kurie} (which is a not-secret pen name for an author that I can’t identify…) 


Single POV, the book is about a (mostly) human FMC who, in her own words… 


“We’re hand-me-down acquirers,” I corrected, taking a bit of Liz’s silly wordage. “We take from the bad guys, what they’d already stolen. We’re like… Han Solo Hood.”


Her crew-turned sort of family take on jobs in space, which includes transporting potentially seedy characters. One such character is a Polluxian - literal blob-man that sustains itself on the emotions of others. He can transform from goop form to solid states. Our heroes meet when she accidentally absconds with him thinking he was an inanimate object. Hijinks, heart, and creative heat follow. 


(Confession: I don’t get hot and bothered from reading smut, but let me tell you - this book had some extremely well written scenes. The authors turned what could have potentially been too weird to work, to me wanting a jelly-man for my own.) 

Solid 3.5/5 for me. 


But ebethie, why a gush post for a 3.5 rating? 


Look, I loved this book… except for a few things. Spoilers to follow. 


Point deduction spoiler 1: >!The reason that the two MCs get together is because FMC walked in on her then-boyfriend balls deep (actual description) in another crew mate. There was too much angst about that drama and the fact that her other crew mates knew the two were shacking up - a touch too much internal turmoil on what family means after they betrayed her trust.!<


Point deduction spoiler 2: If this book ended before the last 3-4 chapters, I would have rated it higher. >!I loved that the FMC and MMC were obsessed, supportive, and loved each other. But after the big conflict, they invite a crew mate into their relationship? I don’t mind that sort of thing, but it seemed out of character and too sudden - major change in trajectory from where the couple started and built their relationship. I think the idea was interesting from a cultural standpoint for the MMC, but it should have been introduced sooner to build up to that ending.!<


Overall, I loved it. It was fun, different, and definitely broke my reading slump. Try it if you want a new flavor of monster/alien boyfriend!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/zb843g/bored_of_6pack_abs_tired_of_monstrous_size/,2022-12-03T04:58:33Z,17,60,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
13xzydo,Happy Place by Emily Henry was really not for me. I really do not enjoy her writing style,"
Spoilers below! 

Harsh critique incoming. According to Goodreads everyone loves this book but I thought it was just fine and had a good few problems with it. 

I regretfully spent money and bought Happy Place by Emily Henry last week because it was cheaper in Liverpool than it was back home and all the reviews told me it was for fans of Folklore by Taylor Swift. I read People We Meet On Vacation before and thought it was... fine. And this book gets the same review. Its just fine. 

I actually had the opposite experience with this as PWMOV though because with that I was really enjoying it for the first 2 thirds and then the ending was a letdown. Whereas with Happy Place I found the first two thirds boring and the last part was where it started to get interesting. 

I could not connect with any of the characters in Happy Place. Everyone is really one dimensional and I feel like Emily really wanted me to think these people were all fun and interesting when they just weren't. There is nothing worse than reading parts of a book that are supposed to be funny but just aren't. Sabrina and Parth were AWFUL by the way. I have no idea why they were forgiven so quickly. They decide they know better and just meddle in their friends lives. They KNOW Wyn and Harriet would both be devastated because they broke up after years together and yet they still force them into an awful awkward situation because they're convinced they know better. Cleo was just boring. The only interesting thing she did was get pregnant and that was only interesting because it taught me that you can't get tattoos while pregnant. Kimmy spends her time squeeing and sticking up for Cleo. 

Now I don't mind miscommunication in a romance. People do this in real life ALL THE TIME. Its very realistic and a portrayal of how real humans behave. Do you always say perfectly how you feel? Do you always understand your partners needs? Of course not. So I don't mind this idea. I think it can be done extremely well like in Normal People by Sally Rooney where we know see that their miscommunication is often due to class and its used to make a commentary. It's also just realistic because they're so young and inexperienced and figuring out themselves and life. 

Here however they've been together like over 6-7 years or something right? Yet they are unable to fucking talk to eachother or like just anticipate how their partner would react to things. Yes there are real external circumstances keeping them apart but they also just seem to not understand eachother at all on like a base level (which is funny because the author painstakingly makes obvious exactly who they are by spelling it out very explicitly to save you from having to think or reflect at all while reading) Wyn can't imagine why Harriet never fights or gets emotional even though by now he knows exactly what she's like and what her parents were like. Ask her about it? Nah. Harriet can't ask him what he wants or needs either. 

Harriet is supposed to be smart and someone who overthinks but accidentally spent a decade working towards a career she didn't want. Oops! It's fine she'll get a job at a pottery studio instead even though she's bad at it and got into it like a couple months ago. Could she use her medical knowledge in a related field just with less hours and stress? Idk she doesn't think of it. Her grandkids will be paying off those student loans. She wanted an impressive career that would make her parents feel their sacrifices were worth it so she picks surgeon and that seems to be literally the only thought she put into it. She was annoying as fuck honestly. ""Hes a golden boy and Im a girl whose life has been drawn in shades of gray 😔"" What shades of grey?? You had a normal upbringing apart from that your parents didn't love eachother and you became a high achiever?? You're not Holden Caulfield 

Sabrina liking Wyn years ago was a pointless detail that just drew out him and Harriet getting together for like two chapters extra but otherwise is never thought of again.  

People often say Emily Henry writes romance with a more literary fiction style but I do not see that at all. Everything is way too spelled out and there's very little room to reflect and ponder about anything and it's all full of bad banter and just weird sentences like ""The right side of his cupids bow twitched"" ""My stomach makes a noise like a possum"" Also my pet peeve of using italics too much idk why it bothers me but it just does. Constant mentions of the cupids bow OMG. Drove me up the fucking wall!! 

Some things I actually did like 

● The MMC being insecure about his intelligence and preferring to work with his hands but really struggling with not feeling smart enough for his partner. Made him way more endearing. It feels like a real insecurity a real person would have and he comes off the most like a real person when discussing that 

● The parts about grief were genuinely emotional 

● There's some stuff in there about moving on from your friend group as you get older that's also pretty emotional and handled well 

● Wyn is cool and the most complex character here. 

● The ""you you you"" refrain and just the parts where we get to see how their relationship fell apart

● I was rooting for them to be together which means the book did succeed in that objective 

I do get why people would like this book and connect with it. For me it's mainly the writing that puts me off. It's unfortunate because I've been meaning to read Beach Read and Book Lovers because everyone loves them but I found this and PWMOV just so aggressively mid",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/13xzydo/happy_place_by_emily_henry_was_really_not_for_me/,2023-06-02T01:53:42Z,11,23,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
160714v,TikTok authors have let me down… but I’m still so excited for Assistant to the Villain by Hannah Maehrer,"I know, I know, TikTokkers turned authors have let us collectively down in the past… but I can barely contain my excitement for Hannah Maehrer’s book! I fell in love with Evie, Becky, Blade, dragon, and the rest of the motley office crew! Her book, {Assistant to the Villain by Hannah Nicole Maehrer} is out on Friday. I am both terrified that it’ll be horrible and not live up to the TikTok series, and so excited for the potential! 

Blurb here:

*Once Upon a Time meets The Office in Hannah Maehrer’s laugh-out-loud viral TikTok series turned novel, about the sunshine assistant to an Evil Villain…and their unexpected romance.*

*ASSISTANT WANTED: Notorious, high-ranking villain seeks loyal, levelheaded assistant for unspecified office duties, supporting staff for  random mayhem, terror, and other Dark Things In General. Discretion a must. Excellent benefits.*

*With ailing family to support, Evie Sage's employment status isn't just important, it's vital. So when a mishap with Rennedawn’s most infamous Villain results in a job offer—naturally, she says yes. No job is perfect, of course, but even less so when you develop a teeny crush on your terrifying, temperamental, and undeniably hot boss. Don’t find evil so attractive, Evie.*

*But just when she’s getting used to severed heads suspended from the ceiling and the odd squish of an errant eyeball beneath her heel, Evie suspects this dungeon has a huge rat…and not just the literal kind. Because something rotten is growing in the kingdom of Rennedawn, and someone wants to take the Villain—and his entire nefarious empire—out.*

*Now Evie must not only resist drooling over her boss but also figure out exactly who is sabotaging his work…and ensure he makes them pay.*

*After all, a good job is hard to find.*

I just wanted to share in case anyone else is a jumble of emotions. (No? Just me?) Oh I hope it’s good, I’ve never wanted a TikTokker turned author to succeed so badly before!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/160714v/tiktok_authors_have_let_me_down_but_im_still_so/,2023-08-24T16:39:45Z,4,6,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
yaooit,"Eve Dangerfield let me down, I wish I hadn’t read Velvet Cruelty.","I like Eve Dangerfield, she’s a one-click, auto-buy, pre-order author for me. I was delighted that her new book [Velvet Cruelty](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61427184-velvet-cruelty) released in time for me to load it up before a flight so I could have uninterrupted time to read it.

Promoted as a Reverse Harem/Why Choose Snow White and the Seven Dwarves Mafia Retelling romance and it's written by Eve? Instantly excited. Such high expectations.

… cue \~360 pages of the FMC getting sexually assaulted and the MMCs just being… mean. Not even  bully-mean. Just **abhorrently cruel** to the FMC.

(And I don't even have the energy to get started on the purity culture and the FMC’s value being 100%  dependent on the status of her virginity and it being used as a bartering chip.)

But like... what did I just read? Maybe this is my fault for not having the right expectations as I went into the story? I wasn't expecting it to be a dark romance (it's not really billed as a dark romance?), nor was I expecting it to end on a cliffhanger (yet another strike against it, as it was not promoted as the first book of a **trilogy** and I was not mentally prepared to be left with unresolved feelings, honestly none of which are even remotely romantic, towards these characters).

The MMCs treat her like an idiot while they abuse her, as if it's her fault she's been sheltered by an evil step mom and a creepy pedophile who decided he wanted her at 8 years old and was just counting down the days until she turned legal. How is she expected to know any different? To act any differently? The have no respect for her as a woman, or even as a human. They're terribly cruel to her - for no reason! It's not her fault she was being married off to their arch nemesis. And any softening of feelings from the MMCs to her happening in this book feels so totally fake because the only difference between the present and the past (when they were all surveilling her and stalking her and pretending to be her confessional priest or her math tutor - I can't even get into the betrayal and how awful they were to be laughing at her when she confessed a crush on her tutor to her priest) is that now they can see her naked.

Apparently Hot Body + Virginity = Value (kind of?) as a ~~Woman~~ ~~Human~~ Thing.

The book ends with the FMC abducted and is thinking to herself that she just needs to wait for the MMCS to find/save her. The blurb to book 2 refers to the men the FMC is in love with. *\*\*looks around confused\*\** Who the heck is she talking about? Who is she in love with? **The men who lied to her for years, then abducted her, humiliated her, caged her, drugged her, physically and sexually assaulted her, who have no respect for her?** Those guys? And love? There's been more emotional connection between the FMC and the guy who takes her to the bathroom and feeds her every day than there has been with any of the MMCs! And even ignoring the disrespect and abuse, giving it the benefit of the dark romance genre, there's been no emotional build up, definitely no love happening or growing.

I know Eve Dangerfield as an author can write love. She can write feelings and tension and desire and a heart telling you one thing when your mind tells you another and she just... didn't. This feels hollow.

I’m just confused and I disliked it so much and I'm so let down because Eve is an author I truly enjoy and I expected more from her and this book has kinda ruined her writing for me for a bit.

&#x200B;

Edit: as I sit with this longer, I think what I'm bothered by is the lack of emotional connection between the characters. I'm good with dark romance, but it needs to have some sort of emotional connection for me to find the dark parts a reasonable trade off. I think the cliffhanger ending is really hurting my overall view of the book as well because I'm not getting any sweet payoff for making it through the dark parts?

&#x200B;

**Also, I recognize your mileage may vary and this might be exactly the book you are looking for - if so, enjoy! Eve Dangerfield is a great author and hopefully the right audience reads this book and enjoys it. For those interested/debating reading it, here are some of the CWs for this book (spoilers ahead):**

* Violence: >!Murder of a bodyguard (in front of the FMC, by a MMC), physical abuse (FMC is slapped multiple times, dragged by her hair, etc.), general physical assault against the FMC.!<
* Sexual assault: >!FMC forced to deep throat a loaded gun multiple times, FMC drugged with a date rape drug by MMCs, FMC is date rape drugged by her previous fiancee in the past and narrowly escaped being assaulted, FMC does not actively consent to a lot of the sexual encounters!<
* Child abuse: >!Evil step-mom sells FMC to who we later find out is a pedophile (he meets her when she's 8 and decides he wants to marry her), FMC is starved to achieve a specific weight in accordance with ex-fiancee's wishes, as well as some general emotional neglect and abuse!<

i1tm1c,"Rec me some lesser-known, slow burn sci-fi romance!","It's me again, hopping between genres. I've been on a sci-fi romance binge this week and I'm running out of picks!

I've read and enjoyed books by Linnea Sinclair (except the Dock Five books), Michelle Diener, Jessie Mihalik, Carol Van Natta and Lois McMaster Bujold. I like slow burn romance with less steam, but still very keen on action, politicking, and/or explosions! I'm up for sci-fi with a good romance subplot too; I liked the romances in Becky Chambers' series.

I've tried and didn't enjoy books by Ruby Dixon, Ann Aguirre, Ilona Andrews, T.A. White, Ruby Lionsdrake, V.C. Lancaster, and Catherine Asaro. Alpha heroes are a bit of a dealbreaker for me and there are a ton of them in this genre.

I have been combing through the past recs here for sci-fi, but - not to yuck anyone's yum - I'm personally not up for alien dick. My threshold for non-human is probably about Brishen in Grace Draven's *Radiance*, if that gives you an idea. The 'wholesome American woman is abducted but it's fine, the aliens are hot' subgenre is also a no for me, with the Michelle Diener books as the rare exception. I just like romance, In Space! Aliens optional.

sbtru1,Please Help!!! This is driving me nuts!,"I read a shifter romance book a while back, and I cannot remember the name of it.

Here's what I remember from it. The female lead was rejected by her fated mate (the alpha of her pack); but when he makes it clear that even though he rejected her, she still belongs to him, she ran. I remember there being some step that she had to say that she was no longer a part of the pack before she left which disconnected her from it. The bad alpha felt it and he tried to go after her.

Then I remember she was on her own and working in a bar when she meets this other guy that she starts to like (who happens to be the alpha of his own pack) Then the bad alpha finds her again and tries to drag her back. The new guy ends up fighting for her kills the bad one. Then I remember at the end, he said something to her like ""He was only your mate to get you to me."" or something.

sledrk,Searching for a romance book for a male(25) who wants something to relate to when starting to date for the first time. A book you think might be useful for someone like me,"Hi all,

Some background about me: I am male and 25 yrs old and am starting to consider dating for the first time. I identify with being demisexual(it's on the asexual spectrum) so am usually pretty happy on my own without random hookups and such. However I feel like I'm missing out on a good part of life (cuddles sound real good y'all!) by remaining single so I am getting myself mentally prepared to start dating.

Kinda scary but also exciting. I however don't know what to expect from dating and the first stages of a possible relationship (sadly I have mainly seen dysfunctional relationships in my immediate environment). 

What I'm looking for:

A story that is written from the perspective of a person like me(adult who is first ever time starting to date) or a book you could imagine being helpful for a person like me would be very much appreciated. I've read the first book of the Bromance book series before and liked it, but I'm looking for a book I can relate to a bit more. Specifically I do not want a book that has a conclusion where the main character comes to terms with loving themselves after being rejected or something, I'm happy with myself and that would not be interesting or useful to me. And I am looking for a story, not a self help book or anything like that. Mainly a book to relate to a little bit that you feel can provide a little bit of guidance to a new 'prospective dating person'.

qxtgv9,Please help me find these two books with these vague details I read over ten years ago. Sorry!,"Okay so first book was a traditional romance. It was set in colonial America, either right before or during or right after the civil war. Main female character was blonde and ran a shop or a bar (there’s a scene of her and main dude going downstairs the establishment and talking around a bunch of barrels.) she had a secret child from him, he didn’t know and left to fight in (the war maybe?) and at some point came back, saw her and was like I’ve thought about you! And she was like no go away and then of course he saw the kid.


Book two: abused woman escapes with her son. They move into a new house and she asks the neighbor “hey if you ever see me flickering my porch lights please get my kid on his way from school- that means my abusive
Husband has me” lady was rude and slammed the door but when husband does find them, she flicks the lights and old lady grabs the kids and calls the police. That’s all I remember 🤦‍♀️",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/qxtgv9/please_help_me_find_these_two_books_with_these/,2021-11-20T00:27:46Z,6,8,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
ujv2wa,Under Her Skin by Adriana Anders has left me with so many emotions,"
No spoilers here- I have to mention this book because I did a search and only saw it brought up once in this sub.  Maybe twice. This book jerked my emotions all over the place in the best way.  There are lots of trigger warnings due to the FMC's traumatic past that she's trying to work through. (Trigger warnings include: trauma, sexual assault, emotional abuse and severe physical abuse that in my mind was more like torture.) She recalls memories throughout the book and it gets dark at times,  so if that's a hard no for you then this not your book. I've never once have I been so emotionally invested in a heroine before.  Your heart just breaks for her and her story, but the whole time you'll be rooting for her and cheering her on.  The communication between the FMC and MMC during sex is *chefs kiss*. The love scenes are beautifully written and some of the sweetest I've ever read and I loved that they were realistic and  not some of the ""I'm working through a traumatic past but now suddenly I'm a sex goddess who can get off instantly"" that I seem to see often.

Excuse me while I go feel all the feels of this book. I did not know it was possible to feel this many emotions in one day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/ujv2wa/under_her_skin_by_adriana_anders_has_left_me_with/,2022-05-06T19:22:07Z,7,16,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
pz3qz5,I want to read romance novels but the plots bore me *yawn*,"I'm basically looking for a plot that is unique. Maybe I haven't been looking in the right places so I'm going list some plots I'm looking for. If you can recommend a book that has some of these that is well written let me know:

1. King falling in love with servant girl and having a baby but trying to hide this secret. Filled with drama and surprises.
2. Woman who uses magic to cast a love spell and find a loving man but he turns out to be psychotic.
3. Woman who has made a close male friend that was formerly her husband that died in a car accident but came back to life to be with her but he is 20 years younger than her but she doesn't know that he reincarnated. 
4. Male teacher falling in love with a student but the book must be written in the perspective of the teacher with internal monologues included.
5. A woman who wants to euthanyze herself and plans to have sex for the last time before she does it but the man she meets turns out to be her soulmate and when he learns about her plans he does everything he can to stop her and show her the beautiful things life can offer.
6. A woman who goes into her dreams to fantasize a life with her perfect partner only to meet a spitting image of him at work the next day. Everything from the name to the mannerisms are identical and the more she spies and learns about him the more surprises he has.

zdl12f,Reading Challenge: Nostalgia in 2023. (Science-fiction/fantasy edition) Would anyone like to join me?,"Inspired from [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/zck3hv/what_book_started_your_love_for_romance/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about your gateway romance book/author. I posted that my gateway to romance started in science fiction/fantasy books that had a romantic subplot. I loved the responses/comments as it seemed like there were several of us that also started on this path. I set little challenges for myself - 2022 was the year of no male authors - and I was debating what my goal would be for 2023. I had been thinking about one nostalgic book a month (I usually read anywhere from 5-25 books a month, depending on my mood and what I have going on). I think I'm going to go for it as my personal challenge - would anyone like to join me? We could do a monthly buddy read - I think it would be super interesting to recall what we remember about the book vs reading it now and our thoughts/feelings. (Mostly, has it stood the test of time?) Of course, if you haven't read the book before, it'll be all new to you and that is a-okay!

Rules. I think these are flexible but my thoughts:
1.) Romance is the subplot (it's still there, but not the sole focus)

2.) Original publication of the book (not re-issuance) has to be from 2003 and earlier (we're going old school!)

3.) Only 1-2 books per author, and only the first in the series (if the book is in a series)

4.) Male or female authors, steam/spice or no steam/spice okay (but disclose ahead of starting the  book)

5.) No Robert Jordan - sorry, I know he was an awakening for many of us with the romance plots, but I don't have the energy or stamina anymore haha 


My author suggestions:

Anne McCaffrey

Linnea Sinclair

Mercedes Lackey 


Comment your authors/books and I'll create a reading challenge list (example: January, ""Dragonsong"" by Anne McCaffrey)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/zdl12f/reading_challenge_nostalgia_in_2023/,2022-12-05T21:50:08Z,0,9,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
ublc0o,Suggest me some romance books that will make me cry,"I've desperately been in the mood for a good cry. But I've noticed that when other people ask for recommendations of ""books that will make me cry"", most answers are usually historical or contemporary fiction, which isn't my thing at all. I want some recommendations for romance books that have made you cry. 

I don't want conventionally sad romances (i.e. death, cheating, growing apart, separated for ten years, and so on), and I don't want abuse or trauma to be used as a crux. Please no Colleen Hoover. Rather than romance books on most sad lists, I'd rather recommendations which are a little personal to yourself. Like, the kind that you don't quite know why you were crying. 

I want the kind of tears that are almost warm and are constant and gentle, rather than heaving sobs. 

For an idea of what I meant, and also recommendations for other people, I cried while reading:

* [Just a Bit Wrong](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55358046-just-a-bit-wrong) by Alessandra Hazard (M/M). Tristan believes he isn't worthy of love, but he desperately needs it. He does everything he can to make people love him - playing soccer so that millions of people will adore him - but thinks he's alone in the world. He falls in love with Zach, but knows that he is only having sex to get Tristan out of his system before he gets married in three months (Zach and his fiancee are in an open relationship). This is a major spoiler, but it all culminates in the most painful way at the end of the book, when>!Tristan injures himself so that he can never play professionally again. !<And it honestly killed me. I cried so fucking hard.
* [Nanny for the Neighbors](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58295598-nanny-for-the-neighbors) by Lily Gold. Beth grew up in an orphanage and never had a family. She starts to grow closer to her three neighbours (it's a menage romance), and even though they are totally in love with her, she doesn't believe she has a place in their family. Again, major spoiler, but at the end of the book, >!Beth believes she might be pregnant, only to find out she's actually infertile. She goes to meet her birth mother, and finds out that the woman is married and has two young children. Beth finds out that her mother knew that infertility ran in their family and froze her eggs in her twenties. But she never sought out Beth to let her know. So because the mother wanted to forget her teenage pregnancy, Beth will never have kids. !<This thing right here, I was a wreck for days.
* [Transcendence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20504754-transcendence) by Shay Savage.
* [Breaking Him](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25683898-breaking-him) (Love is War Series) by R.K. Lilley. This one kind of goes against what I said I wanted, since there's death, cheating, growing apart, separated for ten years, abuse and trauma, and so on. I'm definitely open to those things, if it's worth it (which this duology is for me).",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/ublc0o/suggest_me_some_romance_books_that_will_make_me/,2022-04-25T13:36:22Z,2,3,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
lks88x,Bridgerton--Is It Just Me But I Can't Get Into It? I Feel Insane and So Guilty That I Can't Get Into It.,"This isn't one of those ""I'm trying to be anti-pop culture"" moments.

You don't know me but my closest friends know I basically only read romance--namely historical or paranormal. Like if there isn't at least a side plot of side characters having a romance that's featured, I'm not reading it. I do have a lot of growing in the kinds of books I read--I can agree.

But I honestly feel insane. I feel like I should really like Bridgerton. I LOVE THEIR CONCEPT. I've heard so much about it. I was very excited when I finally had time to actually watch it. I've taken my third stab at it just this past week and just got bored and went back to YouTube. Like it didn't grab me. With Game of Thrones--something I watched because my dear dear friend really wanted someone to talk to about it and I wanted to support their interests--grabbed me and I didn't stop. I watched all four seasons over like two or three days. They were stunned when I told them I had seen all the seasons so they could start talking to me more (this was way back when too). I had the same weird experience with Crazy Rich Asians and Black Panther. I expected to love both, but was left not so impressed with Crazy Rich Asians but totally into Black Panther. Both were hypes at the same time and both were lauded to the moon. And I should have loved Crazy Rich Asians a lot because it's romance! Also because I'm Chinese--I should have loved it even more.

Like this Historical Romance's time to shine. I'm all for normalizing and celebrating romance. IT'S ALL I READ! But this one I just can't get that into. And I don't know why. I know I've definitely read ""worse"" Historical Romances than anything Bridgerton is offering (not to knock those authors too badly). I just feel so bad and like wondering if there's a problem with me? I honestly don't think I'm racist too but it's kind of terrifying that I don't like Bridgerton and don't know why. Earlier when I spoke to some people who were really hyped about it, they mentioned to me that some of their friends or family were shocked at the diverse cast. Like I'm super hyped for the new British mini-series with Henry the VIII. I'm totally into Hamilton. We certainly all have racist tendencies but seeing non-white people in a white-washed era didn't upset me. Hearing about it excited me. Because it's not like we didn't exist then and it's not like we weren't hot or having great sex too. The diverse nature of the cast is actually what made me decide to sit down and watch it, and stop putting it off. That is what really got me interested. I know it should have been obvious that it was a diverse cast, but I never paid much attention and I'm not much of a Netflix person. I mainly do YouTube. I don't know if it matters but I'm also not white and if you saw me in real life--there's not the way I would look white to anyone. I'm completely East Asian.

Sometimes I cringe at the dialogue but honestly who hasn't cringed at some romance dialogue. Traditional cringy dialogue doesn't make me close a book. I've read through the entire series where I hated the author just because of their style of writing, but I needed to know what happened. But that's literally all I can think of that I knew I didn't particularly ""like"" or ""love"".

Oddly, I was super into 50 Shades but I'd already read better BDSM books than 50 Shades before that. So it's not like I don't get on these kinds of band wagons. Super into Twilight. That was another one. Didn't pick a team though.

I just need someone to at least tell me I'm not the only one or that it's okay I'm not super into this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/lks88x/bridgertonis_it_just_me_but_i_cant_get_into_it_i/,2021-02-16T01:15:54Z,51,38,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
pmhv84,What have y'all done to me with Zodiac Academy? I need more non-RH magic academies,"So I've already blazed through the first three books in the series, in as many days - and I am lowkey dreading finishing the series as it isn't complete yet and will throw me into cliffhanger purgatory for months. 

So I would really appreciate it if you guys could help me out of this mess y'all put me in by suggesting some similar magic-school themed books which are NOT reverse harem. I've seen a lot of books with similar premises to Zodiac but unfortunately they're all RH which is just not my jam. Even the other series by the author(s) are all RH which is a bummer. (Incidentally, searching using the magic button for non-RH just gives me RH recommendations. No thank you!) 

I like that the fmcs actually date other people before the main mmcs, as it draws out the slow burn and gives all the delicious jealousy moments , but I don't want them to ultimately end up with more than one person. 

I also enjoy the bullying aspect although it's not necessary (I loved Untouchable by Sam Mariano and Dirty Girls by Lily White which are also great bully romances). And I think one of my favourite aspects is the fact that it's in a ""closed"" world, like almost everything happens on campus and there are great support/side characters and non-romance related drama (like with the girls' pranks in Zodiac). 

Please help me out!! I am on a collision course with Zodiac withdrawal and it is promising to be painful. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/pmhv84/what_have_yall_done_to_me_with_zodiac_academy_i/,2021-09-11T23:35:22Z,7,18,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
vxieoj,A Thank You and brief review of books that were recommended to me via this subreddit,"I know sometimes it can seem thankless to respond to a lot of recommendation posts, so I'm following up on mine: [Seeking recommendations: didn't realize I was gay/bi](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/s6yol9/seeking_recommendations_didnt_realize_i_was_gaybi/)

Some limitations: while I didn't mention this in the post, I mostly access books via Libby, so if I recommendation wasn't in the Libby library, I haven't put it on hold. This *was* the boost I needed join the Brooklyn Overdrive though, so thank you! I'm still working my way through hold lists (or recommending the library buy the ebook/audiobook) for some of things recommended but I have read a pretty good chunk so far:

1. Him by by Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy -- this is the first one I read, and I liked it so much that I immediately followed it up with Us. It was *exactly* what I was looking for, and through this and other books, I realized that I also kind of love scenes where people come out to their family/friends. The other thing I apparently like are illness/hospital scenes.

2. Heated Rivalry by Rachel Reid -- I didn't realize so much of this would involve hockey but I guess I'm into hockey players now. This is another one I liked so much that I've read most of the other ones now, just waiting on the Long Game to come off my holds list. One of these books has a really intense plane scene that I liked as a plot/tension builder.

4. Proper English by KJ Charles -- Another one that just wasn't for me. I read the book before this in the series and I just wasn't enamored by the cast of characters.

4. Charm Offensive -- this one just wasn't for me. I think I'm not into caretaking when it comes to long-term illnesses/neurodivergence. 

5. Wrong Number, Right Woman by Jae -- this was pretty sweet and I liked that everyone in it had pretty regular jobs (grocery store, bus driver) and the ""bi awakening""/coming out to friends and family was so lovely and supportive.

While working my way through these, I came across another bi awakening in The Summer Place by Jennifer Weiner -- one of the POV characters realizes he has feelings for men while reading Draco/Harry and Frodo/Sam fanfic.

mhfg0v,r/RomanceBooks Fantasy and Paranormal Romance Recommendation Database (managed by me) is in BETA! You can begin submitting recs now! (Sci-Fi Database is Live and also accepting recs! Info for both in post.),"# Update: The database is fully functional and live now!

Notes about the Beta: The form should be close to its final state! So now it’s just a matter of adding recs to the database and making final tweaks to the responses. I’m calling it a beta for a few reasons. First, your reddit username is required to submit an entry. If you don't feel comfortable with this, it will no longer be required when the official version releases. Additionally, the filter function is going to be turned off in the spreadsheet. This is because the BETA is in google sheets, not Excel Online. And Google Sheets doesn't make filtering on view-only Entries Easy. Lastly, I haven't added any Formatting to the spreadsheet; it will look a lot prettier on final release!

General Info: I manage the community's sci-fi romance recommendation database, and am working on getting a Fantasy and Paranormal Romance recommendation database going! Thank you so much to everyone who contributed to [my call for help yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/mgtv6o/developing_an_rromancebooks_fantasy_romancepnr/) \-- your suggestions were amazing and made it really easy to get the BETA started quickly!

The idea for both databases is that you can filter on a bunch of metadata (tropes and other information) simultaneously to find *exactly* the book or series you want for your next read. **Recs come from lots of members of the this sub; I just make sure the organization makes sense!**

I decided to do things a little differently this time around, and allow you, the *absolutely amazing* members of this community, to help add the initial recs before the official version is launched. Make sure to [check the current list of entries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ONMqDLJGUffAZDl8YLNU1oiKkDEOOe5C3JV24mzm-I0/edit#gid=1703585706) to make sure you aren't entering something another user has already added.

Thank you so much to everyone for all the excitement, help, and positive comments about these projects. I'm so glad that you're excited about these resources and I'm really happy I could help! If you have any suggestions, questions, or comments about either database, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. These are intended to be community resources, and I want to make sure everyone feels like they have a say in the direction they go in.

# Help me r/RomanceBooks; you're my only hope.

ozpqnl,"I love you Ruby Dixon, but don't do this to me 🥺","I put on content warning for precaution I think hahaha.

So, I'm reading currently Fire in His Veins from the Fireblood Dragons series. I've read all Ice Planet Barbarians and Ice Home books and loved them. Thought I would try the dragon series. But book 6 is getting on my nerves.

[SPOILER]

Andi and Liam stop one night at a sex shop to rest and here it goes. There are talks about lube, but Andi keeps on talking about how it is used by men who don't really help the woman get in the mood and wet enough (???). I tried to let it go, but then later on Andi sees Liam naked and says ""Man, I bet those idiots that run the sex store feel stupid now... They don't need dildos or anything crazy when there's men like you around.""

And honestly that's conflicting for me. I have dildos, I have butt plugs, I'm 22 and sometimes I use lube 'cause I don't get wet enough on my own (pill and all that). It just feels in these two conversations like 90% of men were rapist even *before* the rift and that people who like dildos and other stuff are crazy (???). I might be seeing stuff wrong here and it doesn't make sense 'cause in the Ice Planet Barbarians series there is talk about the good use of lube, and dildos so I'm confused.

Are those the thoughts of the character only? But why so degrating?

I don't understand and I'm kinda feeling like a freak now hahaha. Maybe I'm just sensitive lately. So sorry if I offend anyone. This is kind of a rant, but I'm still on to the series (very good by the way 🥰).",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/ozpqnl/i_love_you_ruby_dixon_but_dont_do_this_to_me/,2021-08-07T08:45:05Z,13,40,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
rl62vh,"Want a funny, light, fantasy romance series with mild angst, interesting female characters who aren’t helpless, and heroes who are devoted sweethearts by day and growly alphas in the sheets? Allow me to introduce you to Stay a Spell by by Juliette Cross","Ok, I know I’m not the first person to recommend [Wolf Gone Wild](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48988286) and the other books in this series. But seriously, it’s so frickin good and I only have 35 pages left before I’m caught up and I’m left with a major book hangover. 

I listened to the audiobook versions of Wolf Gone Wild and [Don’t Hex and Drive](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53566150), and the short stories [Walking in a Witchy Wonderland](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57839135). (Having read the third one on kindle, Incan tell you they’re just as good without the audio!) The narration is good on all of them, but it’s particularly funny for book 1. The reason why: because the silliness that happens with the hero is even more exaggerated by just how into it the narrator gets.

The premise of Wolf Gone Wild is that Mateo’s wolf has a completely separate personality inside his head. Mateo is the ultimate sweet beta male. His wolf? His name is Alpha. And he takes the alpha male stereotypes to such a ridiculous extreme that it’s flat out hilarious. Add the ridiculousness of the voice actor getting really into it on the audiobook, and I was ready to roll on the floor laughing every time Alpha spoke up.

The combination of sweet and dominant is incredibly sexy to me, and I absolutely adore all of the stories in this series written so far. Praise kink and “good girl” in all the books? Yes please!

The series is connected by a six sisters, all witches with different powers. They’re all really different personality wise, but all of them are fun/not doormats. And their close knit family makes for really fun interactions. The world building is super fun and it’s interesting to try to keep track of who’s who with such a big cast.

If you like urban fantasy romance with some steam, you should definitely check these out.

##Oh, and if anyone has anything to recommend to get me over my book hangover, I’ll be very thankful!

If you’re experiencing a book hangover yourself, I would probably recommend Dianne Duvall’s 
[Immortal Guardians](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8804062) series — they’re not as light hearted or funny but otherwise will fill a lot of the same check boxes for me.

m6wajv,"I need historically accurate HR recommendations, help me out pls! (+rant about Sarah MacLean lol)","Hey everyone, so based on the stellar recommendations from this sub, I’ve started to read 9 Rules to Break When Romancing a Rake by Sarah MacLean (I’ve never read anything by her before). I’m 20% in and I’m starting to get very frustrated with it. I love the concept of this book, the writing is good, the first few chapters were very promising plot-wise, so I though this would be a 4 star read for me at the very least. But the thing is, I’ve noticed a few things I see as unusual for this era and it’s getting to the point where I can’t ignore them anymore. (Mild spoilers ahead!)

So I’m at the part where >!Callie and Juliana meet for the first time at Ralston House. Callie goes there after receiving Gabriel’s invitation, which earns her a scolding from her maid. I find it veeeeery hard to believe that
a) an unmarried “rake” could openly write to an unmarried lady and her parents would not know;
b) a maid would scold a lady, treat her like an equal and would call her Callie-girl, even if she has known her since forever;
c) but most of all, I find it hard to believe that an unmarried, respectable lady would call on an unmarried gentleman (!) at his home (!!) by herself (!!!). Wtf?! Where are the chaperones? How does her parents allow it? If they don’t know, how could they not know? I mean, I can buy that since she’s 28 and basically a spinster at this point, she has more freedom than an 18-year-old would have, but I can only suspend disbelief so far...!<

Although I’m not English and I’m not particularly educated on the subject of regency England, in my understanding the above scenario falls into the “probably would not happen irl” category. I’m not a history snob (if I was, I’d never read these kind of books), but I need them to be at least somewhat believable. For example, in Lisa Kleypas books the characters often do improper things, but it’s always articulated that such behavior is considered improper by the ton. In the Hathaways series particularly, Kleypas goes out of her way to tell the readers over and over again how quirky this family is and that it is absolutely not how “normal” aristocrats behave. Not only that, but there is a perfectly believable explanation for why they are so different!

So I can get over these things if they are explained and if the author makes it clear that they are, in fact, unusual by normal standard, but when unrealistic scenarios happen and there is no excuse or explanation given, I find it hard to continue.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this subject and I’d be so grateful if you could recommend me authors and HR books where the characters and scenarios are mostly true to this era from the mainstream angle (I’ve read Lisa Kleypas, Tessa Dare, Meredith Duran, Julia Quinn, Mary Balogh, Johanna Lindsey, Courtney Milan and Georgette Heyer so far).

kovtsj,"Green Creek series gushing: join me with your favourite moments (spoilers up to book 3, Heartsong only please!)","Oh my goodness I HAVE to post something because you guys recced me a series and I'm nearly finished it and I am SO IN LOVE WITH IT and I think my friends are going to kill me if I try to quote bits at them any more!

So I was reading the series and I was like, this is ok, this is ok and by the time we hit book three I was like THE BENNETT BROTHERS ARE MY FAVOURITE THING.

I just, this story literally had everything, it had a fantastic ace character, it had all the hurt, it had pack and love and oh goodness.

I think I got my favourite moments down to this:

**Kelly showing up wearing Robbie's shirt, so early on**

""like a work shirt, gray with thin red stripes, the hem hanging around his waist.

There was a name embroidered in a patch on his chest.

ROBBIE.""

**A well written ace sex scene**

""It wasn’t fierce, the way he loved me. It wasn’t the burning fire of passion. It was heavy and soft. It was love unlike anything else I’d felt. My hands tightened in the comforter as he kissed my chest, hands on the button of my jeans. He pulled the zipper down, reaching inside and holding on to me, his hand hot as he caressed me.""

**The hair cutting scene**

**CARTER and the timberwolf**

I settled down on the blanket next to Carter. He pulled another blanket up and over us. I lay on my side away from him and barely flinched when I felt his hand on my waist.

“No homo,” he said. Then, “Well, maybe some homo. I don’t even know anymore. And before someone says anything, shut up. Robbie, just so you know, my morning boner won’t be for you. Mostly.”

“Love,” Elizabeth told her oldest, “I’d rather not hear about such things, if it’s all the same to you. Though I’m glad to hear you’re open to… new experiences.”

“What?” Carter asked. “What new experiences?”

AND

Impossibly, *ridiculously*, Carter whispered through a mouthful of blood, “Oh shit. I think I’m bisexual.”

**The hilarious pack cuddle scene**“You said you were going to piss on me!”

“Whoa,” Chris said, immediately turning around and heading back upstairs. “I do not need to know that. Is that a wolf thing? No one told me that was going to be a wolf thing. Joe! Joe! Do I have to let your brother piss on me or what?”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Joe shouted, sounding outraged.

&#x200B;

**Tell me your favourite moments up to and including this book??**

l0znyh,"Marina Tompson's (Bridgerton show) character reminds me of a regency novel I KNOW I've read before, but cannot place. Woman marries younger brother of dead lover to protect illegitimate child, but it turns out all the love letters were from younger bro all along?","EDIT 2: calling this one solved. Thanks everyone who made suggestions! Best I can tell, the conflated two books by Kleypas and Heath are the answer. Special thanks to u/Pixi-Stix, u/maellie27 and u/ChipotleBananas for their suggestions, and investigative skills. Happy reading, all!

EDIT: current working theory is that my memory is conflating two books, the letter-writing from ""Love in the Afternoon"" by Lisa Kleypas, and the brothers/pregnancy plot from ""The Earl Takes All"" by Lorraine Heath. I wont call it solved just yet, in case the actual book I'm looking for is still out there, but these two together are really strong candidates.


Original request from r/whatsthatbook here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/l0uykr/marina_tompsons_bridgerton_netflix_character/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


The closest we could get to an answer there was ""not a Julia Quinn book."" Hoping that the your specialized expertise here might know more. It's killing me I cant remember anything more about the book! 

Copy/pasted description from r/whatsthatbook:

In the book I'm remembering, the heroine is madly in love with a local lord's son. They pass notes to each other, and write to each other while he's at school. Eventually they do the hibbety dibbety before he goes to war, and she ends up pregnant. Younger brother turns up some weeks later with the news that his older brother had died. Knowing that she is pregnant, he offers to marry her and recognize the baby and support them both. As the two get to know each other and slowly fall in love, it comes out that the younger brother was the one writing her the letters back in the day. He was in love with her, but she wouldn't look twice at him so he signed his brother's name to the letters. The night the hibbety dibbety happened, the older brother had no idea that shed been conducting this affair via correspondence, he was just a jerk looking to get laid. The younger brother only found out about the baby after his brother died and he found the heroine's letter to him asking for support for the baby.

Marina's season one storyline has reminded me of that book so strongly, but I cant for the life of me remember either the book name or character names at all, to google. I read through the synopses of all Julia Quinn's books, on her website, and couldnt find the story I'm thinking of. To be fair, my Regency romance bodice-ripper obsession was over, like, 10 years ago now, so I may be misremembering and it's something Phillip actually does explain to Eloise in ""To Sir Phillip With Love"" but I swear what I'm remembering was its own, standalone book.

qmcdyw,Best romance book I’ve ever read- and can you help me find my next read??,"
Guys, I have the ultimate suggestion for you (Sorry this is long 🙈)

I am a mega romance reader ❤️and nothing I have ever read has come close to {Awakened by Catherine Turner}. I can’t stop reading it, it’s actual perfection and I need everyone else to read it so we can talk about how amazing it is. It’s filthy, romantic and so super sexy 🔥I legit felt my pulse racing by the end of chapter 1 😫It’s my only 5 star book for sure. >!Be warned tho, it’s a cliffhanger- but book 2 comes out next yr!<

It’s about 2 18yr olds, Jake and Abby, and Jake basically has had a thing for Abby for ages and finally peruses it, he’s super popular and she’s shy so she’s not sure what to do with it, and the two of them together is just pure 🔥

Here’s the reasons I loved it;

- the smut, omg 🥵It was so filthy and there was SO MUCH OF IT, in legit every chapter. Best kiss I’ve ever read and also best loss of v card scene ever, so sweet 

- MMC is a literal dream, he’s dominant but not aggressive sweet as hell and so GD hot 🥵

- FMC is not annoyingly perfect or dull, she’s real and complex, they both are proper flawed people but in a real way, not a dramatic romance novel way IYKWIM. They also are both very real in the way they speak instead of talking like they are on One Tree Hill or the like 

- The fact that the whole book was focused on the couple and there wasn’t any side plot or characters really. This is key for me as I get bored AF of extra stuff in romance books and always skip it, if MMC and FMC aren’t together I don’t care but they were literally the whole way though this 🥰

Anyway I now need some suggestions for what to read next cos I literally cannot find anything else as good. I just finished Kiss Quotient after seeing it on this sub and I liked it but didn’t love it, thought the set up was good and smutty scenes decent but there was a lot of extra plot I didn’t care about IYKWIM

here’s my other faves before Awakened and the reasons they weren’t quite perfect for me so if anyone can recommend anything on that basis I’d be grateful forever:

Bully (Penelope Douglas) was very hot and a good read, but so much unnecessary extra plot omg 🙄I don’t care that she’s a good racing driver, I don’t want to read about it. I also thought he was too mean and couldn’t invest into them as a couple bcos of that.

Beautiful disaster (Jamie McGuire) had some hot scenes and a hot guy, but I DGAF about secondary characters and the whole side plot with his family, her roommate and the other guy she was seeing was so boring, I also didn’t like what a blatant man whore he was, I don’t need to read that when I want him with FMC 

Hating game (sally Thorne) is prob my fave of these, LOVED the first kiss and them together 😍and how the whole book focuses on them, but there wasn’t enough smut and the sex scene in the hotel just didn’t deliver for me

Thoughtless (SC Stephens) was super hot no complaints there, but didn’t like the man whorish ways of the MMC and also the cheating aspect 
 
The Deal (Elle Kennedy) is my other fave as I thought the smut was great and I loved both FMC and MMC and their dynamic, but I thought some of the dialogue didn’t sound authentic IYKWIM and that distracted me from the characters. 

Anyways, a tough ask IK but if anyone can suggest I’d be eternally greateful! Thanks for reading my rant 🤣

(Bonus if it’s a shy girl/confident guy as I love that 🥰)

• She gets real drunk and sleeps with hero(Who, she thinks hates her)and get pregnant.
• Heroine met her Ex in college, her Ex and the Hero and another guy(Who also hates the heroine) are besties from long back.
• Heroine goes out with her Ex in college coz of this cute, little meaningful notes he leaves for her at the library and they are together ever since until he dumps her.
• But here is the twist, Hero is the one who actually leaves her the notes, but the heroine misunderstands, So hero develops a I-Love-You-but-I’ll-protect-my-poor-heart-by-pretend-hating-you kinda thing.
• The other bestie in the three musketeers hates heroine, because he is gay and in so much love with her now Ex bf.
• The Ex doesn’t know about the pregnancy till the end, and as it turns out he actually dumped heroine to be with another girl who is the friend of Hero’s Ex-Wife to get some inside info on the cruel plan the Ex-Wife is brewing on Hero(Like they have guns and stuff & the reason heroine gets pregnant is that night the Ex-wife break-in to the Hero house and punctures his condom before trying to lure him & get pregnant herself. But hero sleeps with heroine that night & she gets pregnant instead), in short the Ex hurts heroine to save hero.
• At last when the Ex finds out she is pregnant, he opens up and tells everything and begs to marry her, when on knees she tells him his bestie (Our Hero) is the Dad. So the Ex sacrifices his love to protect hero but the hero backstabs him unknowingly.
• There is a whole emergency pregnancy at the end, she has twins - girl & boy - the Ex forgives heroine but not hero.
• Thats the end of book one.


If you read till here, thank you so much for your patience.

So it is so much tough to find this book with no Title and Author’s name, may be she left Wattpad or she again posted back the books, I want to find out, PLEASE help me out if you are into Wattpad and happened to read this(It is quite popular)

qgj77d,Please help me find this step-siblings romance?,"I've been going crazy trying to remember the title of this book and I've already tried on other subreddits about finding books, but no luck so far! Can anybody help a lady going crazy trying to remember it? Here's all that I know:  

Girl's mom marries boy's dad and they become inseparable after that (they were very young- maybe five or something like that). Her step dad was her mom's old boss and they fall in love (this is a really small detail in the book). The first time the girl sees her new house she thinks it's a castle and her new step-dad asks if she'll be the princess of it (not sure about the princess part, have a vague memory of it). After that, it shows a little bit of her and the boy growing up: they were best friends, stayed up late to play videogames, slept in each other's bedroom, I remember this specific scene where the girl has her fisrt period and doesn't wanna talk about it and the boy is very sweet about it (i think he brings her chocolate or somthing like that- she at first didn't wanna tell him because she thinks it's going to change things between them but he says it won't happen). Fast forward to when they're in high school and they start to grow apart and fight a lot because they both have feelings for each other but don't want to desapoint their parents (girl ends up being a daddy's girl and boy a mama's girl, but not in the brat way, more in the sense they don't want to disapoint them), so they hide their feeling until they're both like 18 (they don't know they have feeling for one another). I remember a scene where the boy is teaching the girl how to drive when they're like 16 and she receives a text from another boy and he gets super mad about it and they fight over it. Parents are telling them they should go back to being friends how they were before. Sorry if it got a little confusing, but I tried to put down everything I remembered about it. I think it was realeased this year, but I'm not sure. May be from Ella Goode, Alexa Riley, Lucy Darling, Jessa Kane, or Mink (they're usually my go-to authors so I'm assuming is from one of them, but may be wrong). It's a hot novella and they lose their virginity to one another - they have to dodge their parents for some time, like when they go to the movies and they think they have the house to one another and start to make out but the parents came back early and almost caught them, but I think the dad caught them in the end after they lose their virginity to each other (after prom I think) and sleep in one of their bedrooms, but forget to lock the door. The parents end up being ok about it and everything work outs in the end.

xk8d4v,Can you help me find the title of a book I read about a woman who had her husbands baby while he was missing? Spoilers*,"Adult romance novel

I read this probably 15-17 years ago but it might have been older than that. I’d love if someone could help me out! I’ve been looking for this for years! 

I don't remember many scenes from the book, but the main idea is that there's a woman who has a baby. Her husband has been missing since before she had the baby. You find out later, she wanted a divorce and I think she tells him that around the time he disappeared. 

One of the only scenes I really remember, is that she was with her child, at her parents home. She miiight have a boyfriend. It also might've been christmas. There's a knock on the door and someone goes to answer it. It's her husband, who's been missing for a year. Turns out, he had gotten in an accident, or was attacked or something, and he had amnesia the whole time and he only recently regained his memories, and came home. 

He wants to fix their relationship, she still wants a divorce. It's a romance novel, so obviously they get back together. There's a scene I think where he climbs up to her window and into her room and they get intimate. 
In the morning, he goes downstairs and the baby is in a high chair. 

I'm pretty sure his name was Michael, or maybe the baby was named michael? and I think her name started with an S. Maybe sarah or something.

Please help! I’m desperate. I’ve searched through all the amnesia romance I can, but it’s not any of the ones I’ve found. I think it’s because he had amnesia off script/screen and not in the actual book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/xk8d4v/can_you_help_me_find_the_title_of_a_book_i_read/,2022-09-21T15:41:26Z,1,10,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
o69x70,"A tipsy live-blog review of me reading ""From Blood and Ash"" with no clue what the book is about *SPOILERS*","So, I bought [From Blood and Ash](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Ash-Jennifer-L-Armentrout-ebook/dp/B086JMSSVH/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=from+blood+and+ash&qid=1624441660&sr=8-1) because it was on sale for 99 cents and everyone was talking about it.  But, all I know about it is the heroine is named Poppy and she liked cheese and she's got a villian-y love interest.  Like that's all I've got.  I actually got this book confused with A Court of Thorns and Roses, so I ended up buying both.  (And I was sober when that happened.)  I think this is more YA than romance novel, so I anticipate not liking it very much, to be honest.  I am not a YA person.  I'm just here because of peer pressure.

I am typing out thoughts as I read, so some of my comments will probably be wrong in the end.  Also, I really am drinking (Responsibly.) so there will probably be typos.

&#x200B;

Spoilers abound:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

5% in-- There is a lot of world-building going on. Like A LOT. The fact that I’ve had half a bottle of champagne tonight is not helping me to keep it all straight, but it IS helping me to not care very much. I feel whoozily confident that I’m keeping up with the story. One thing totally I’m sure of: Casteel is Poppy’s love interest, right?  I’m almost positive I’ve heard someone on here mention him before. So far, the book only says he’s the antagonist to the present Queen, but I’m vibing that he’s our antihero guy.

9% in-- Hawke’s… okay, I guess. But I’m not in love with him as the hero. I wasn’t expecting him. I wanted Casteel, who becomes cooler and cooler in my mind the more I drink.

17% in-  Does this book have vampires in it? Suddenly someone has had all their blood sucked. Also, where is Casteel? I feel like I’m waiting and waiting.  There are multiple books in this series, right? He does appear in this one, right?

27% in-  Ugh...  This is a book that describes every button on every dress. There is just so… much…. detail…. I’m a person who skims block paragraphs of descriptions, so I hope it doesn’t matter who all the gods are or what the Duke’s living room looks like. Because I haven’t really been paying attention to any of it.

50% in- Still not feeling Hawke. He is so condescending and pleased with himself. It’s like he’s trying too hard to be the Good Guy.  I hate that he lectures Poppy so much.  And he's always smirking and insufferably amused.

61% in-- Something exciting is finally happening! Bad guys are attacking the Rite. Is it wrong to vote for the werewolves and vampires? Because I am totally voting for the werewolves and vampires. Everyone in this whole town seems terrible, so I'm happy to see them die. This actually the best part of the book, so far.

64% in- YES! That creepy Lord What’s-His-Name guy is dead. NOW we’re getting somewhere.

68% in--  Poppy looks at the city, as she rides away and thinks, “Somewhere in there, my present had become the past.”  That’s a good line. It reminds me of the last day of college, walking out of your final class and knowing that you’ll never be there again.  Bittersweet.

74% in-- Airrick’s death was well-written. Very sad. The action seems to be picking up in the last 1/3 of the book.  I was bored for awhile, but this is snappier.  Adding Rodents of Unusual Size always helps a story.

77% in-- They say “shocker” a lot in this book. Seems like an oddly modern word for a fantasy kingdom. It jars me every time I read it.

79% in-- Uh-oh… They had sex and now Hawke seems to be taking a heel-turn, talking about how she should remember how “real” this moment is.  See, I KNEW I didn’t trust him. I’m so clever.  :)

80% in--I thought we already knew Wolfens were still around? They attacked the Rite, right? I must be confusing them with some other howling monsters. Maybe it was those guys were the zombie Craven creatures.  I switched to a strawberry daiquiri, so it’s getting muddled. Whatever. **I knew Hawke was bad!** That’s all that matters, now.

86% in- Just when I though I couldn’t hate Hawke anymore, he starts pages of exposition at the very end of the book. Shut up, Hawke!  I guess I’m supposed to feel like he has a point about how evil the Ascended are (Because, they are) but it turns out I don’t care.  I feel like he's a liar.  And boring.

87% in-- So, I guess the Atlantians, who I THOUGHT were the vampires, are… not vampires? And the Ascended are the vampires? Or maybe everyone is a vampire. Shit. I’m confused. But I guess it doesn’t matter, since they’re all horrible. Poppy should move to like ANYWHERE else.

90% in-- Wait… Maybe Hawke IS Casteel? Yes? No? I kind of hope not, because that would mean I don’t like Casteel either. Is this even supposed to be a mystery or am I just now making it one?

91% in--  I was right! He IS Casteel. Holy shit! I swear I didn’t know that.  Should I have put it together before now?  I’m not sure whether to be proud that I figured it out a couple pages ago or embarrassed that it took me so long. Bwhahahah! I’m smiling and laughing at myself, either way.

95% in-- People in books always wash their hair with bars of soap. My hair would become a matted, frizzy, horror-nest if I tried that. I’d rather leave the dried blood in it. Sorry. Random thought.

96%-- She was blushing over a kiss at beginning of the book. Now she’s intrigued by the possibility of a three-way with a werewolf. Our little Poppy is growing up.

98% in-- Well, I still don’t like him, but I like him better as Casteel than I did as Hawke. Not sure why. I wouldn’t marry him, though. Nope.  He’s up to something, I’ll bet. He’s always up to something.

The End

Soo.... Final thoughts:  It was a slog with some of the earlier chapters, but I feel like the book got better by the end.  I bet it is a whole new experience when you read it a second time, knowing about Hawke.  I still don't feel like it's ""my"" kind of book, but I see what people like it.  The worldbuilding is complex and the heroine capable.  (Although, I get the sense that she's careening towards becoming the most amazingly special person in the world and I would rather not deal with that.)  The hero is what kills it for me, to be honest.  I just don't like him!  I usually like the bad guy love interest, but he somehow rubs me the wrong way.  Maybe he gets better, as the story goes along?  I'm sensing that Poppy is his fated mate or something?  Maybe that makes him less smug?  IDK.  I would probably read the next book and see for myself, if it was 99 cents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/o69x70/a_tipsy_liveblog_review_of_me_reading_from_blood/,2021-06-23T10:14:17Z,40,54,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
u48pep,Recently read Deliver by Pam Godwin and one of the scenes got me wondering if there are any other books that are similar.,"Hello All,

Just want to ask for recommendations with a similar scene like the one in Deliver by Pam Godwin.

The scene I'm talking about is the one where Van has Sex with Liz in front of Joshua, after Joshua refused to service Van again. So a scene where MMC is forced to witness or watch FMC having intercourse with another. Preferably before they are officially a couple (so not cheating).

For those who haven't read the book the premises are below, please turn back if you don't want to be spoiled:

1

2

3

So Joshua is a captive of Liz and Van. He's developing feelings for Liz even though she's his tormentor. Van is the other kidnapper that has a complicated relationship with Liz. Liz hates Van but Joshua doesn't know the whole story. Joshua is being prepared to be sold to a male and therefore they're trying to get him to submit to a male but Joshua has been resisting the training. Van decided he will rape Joshua and Liz talked him down, saying jealousy would be more effective. So they end up having sex in front of Joshua and Liz shed a tear during the sex (Van terrifies her but she complies in fear for her loved ones and to protect others). Joshua had a lot of internal conflicts while watching the scene, wondering why Liz is going along with it. He felt jealous and possessive and seeing her tears only strengthened his resolve to get to know her and protect her.

I'm looking for something along this vein where the MMC is forced to watch and feel hopeless and immensely jealous and possessive while fmc is being tormented. I guess similar scenes can be found in Still beating by Jennifer Hartmann or the filthy series by Megan D Martin.

I have no triggers. prefer CR. 

No fade to black or clean romances. 

I love stories with strong but vulnerable FMC and would prefer an MMC that's deeply protective of FMC. I prefer MMC is not the tormentor of FMC but I'm honestly not picky as long as it has something similar to the scene above. Bonus points if MMC succeeds in protecting the FMC from future torments or sexual abuse. Any and all recommendations are welcome. Thank you for reading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/u48pep/recently_read_deliver_by_pam_godwin_and_one_of/,2022-04-15T14:00:21Z,5,3,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
pk1v8s,"The Countess Conspiracy by Courtney Milan has RUINED me! Oh, how shall I EVER go on?!","Adult historical romance. Friends to lovers. Rake hero. Beta hero. Icy, cold Heroine. Widowed heroine.

This is my first time reading her book and I am scolding myself for not reading it sooner because, oh God, **I swear if I could give it 10/5 stars, I would!** This book was everything. The romance was so sweet and heartwarming! It’s just… I’m sorry but this goes right in my **top 10 favorite** romance novels.

A lot of readers hate Violet. Some of them say that she wasn’t easy to love and they managed it. I say that I knew I liked her from the beginning. **Icy, cold heroine who puts up walls, shielding her heart?** Count me in! I was really into her personality. Yes, she’s prickly but that’s what I love about her. **I have always been a fan of tortured and cold heroines, however uncommon they are in romance novels.** It’s usually the opposite. Besides, it’s not like she hasn’t any reason to be this way. >!The poor girl had 19 miscarriages, for heaven’s sake!!< **Don’t you DARE tell me she’s an awful person because I will FIGHT you for her honor!** >!Her husband kept telling her she was selfish for not wanting to have sex with him, even though her life was in danger. I am so glad her mother pushed her down the stairs before I found a way to transport myself into the book and push him down the stairs myself!!<

Now let’s talk about Sebastian… first of all, can I just say that I love that name? It’s such a sophisticated name, how can I not love it? Second of all, and a lot of readers agree with me on *this* one, **I fell in love with him not even halfway through the book.** Seriously. I can’t remember the last time I fell for a hero *that* fast! Did I mention he’s 2 years younger than Violet? That rarely happens in HR! Not to mention, they are childhood best friends! I have always adored charming heroes. Rakes are usually the most charming of all and so I end up reading a lot of books with rakes and people assume I just prefer rakes when I DON’T prefer them, at all. I prefer to NOT read books with rake heroes since their morals don’t always… agree with mine. But him! Oh… I loved him… Believe me when I say, I loved him!

He’s a rake who always uses **protection** so he **wouldn't** impregnate the women he’s with. **He respects women.** **Consent** is also really important to him. One time, he entered an inn room with a woman he was planning to spend the night with, but then she burst into tears as she didn’t want to go through with it any longer. Do you know what he did, then? **He whipped out a bag of cards and played with her all night, instead.** Yes. he really did that. *How can I not love him after that?* There’s something I judge men by, I observe how he is with different women. Not just his mother or his girlfriend but also a woman he’s under no obligation to be nice to. ***Let’s just say that Sebastian passed that test.***

He’s always by her side, throughout it all. He’s sweet, understanding, considerate and he’s SWEET! **DID I MENTION CONSIDERATE?!** He’s the best! He’s also been in love with her for half of his life. When he was 5, he actually declared to his older brother that he intended to marry her! But of course, he couldn’t. He was 16 when she married that horrible man, she was 18.

One thing I kept hoping for, aside from hoping that Sebastian doesn’t turn into a douchebag, is that the author >!doesn’t pull the miracle baby card. Violet always has problems with carrying her babies. She always miscarries 2 to 3 weeks past. I wanted the author to keep it that way and not just be like, now that it’s Sebastian, she will magically be able to carry twins for 9 months without any problem and she won’t even die like her doctor had warned her she will. !<Thankfully the author didn’t disappoint!

Another thing is that, >!they only have sex once every few weeks because to do so more frequently poses more risk of her being pregnant and that would be harmful for her.!< And you know what? I loved it! It was so different from the typical things I read, it was amazing! They were married by the end of it. >!They didn’t have any children. They didn’t even have sex very frequently.!< But *YOU KNOW WHAT?* I consider them to be one of the best couples in the history of romantic couples. Their love feels so real. Their emotional connection is to die for. **I never for once felt like they didn’t truly love each other.** They understand each other.  They are Meant To Be! **They. Are. Timeless.**

\# Sorry for rambling so much. I wanted to request something of the ones who *had* read this book. Do you know any other novels with a hero such as Sebastian? You know, with the charms and the devotion and loyalty? And how much he respects women and how sweet he is? How he isn't a hero who's looking to claim the heroine and is busy feeling possessive of her but he's a hero who cares about her and would do anything for her and follows her lead of most things? I really like how much of an Alpha she was and how much of a cute beta he was!

ij4ovl,Help me find the title-M/F Workplace Romance Between Two Teachers,"Wondering if anyone might be able to identify a book. I’m a night nurse and for several nights I’ve caught moments of a novel my patient listens to while falling asleep. She called it her, “happy ever after” book but is limited in her ability to communicate. The parts of the story I’ve caught involve a teacher talking to her friend/colleague about having a crush on a newly hired teacher at her school. To her embarrassment, she had worked with him before and had developed strong feelings that led to her transferring schools so she’d see him less and finally get over him. He apparently is in a relationship oblivious to her feelings and even asks her to housesit while he goes on vacation with his girlfriend. She’s determined to find a way to get over him because she really likes him as a person and thinks he’s phenomenal at his job. 

I’m charmed by how cute my patient is falling asleep to this story each night and would love to know what it is. Unfortunately, she uses a sleep timer and is already in the process of going to sleep by the time I get there. When I asked her about it in the morning, a little sheepish to talk presumably because she’s a little embarrassed by her cute romance book. 

I’d appreciate any guesses you might have!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/ij4ovl/help_me_find_the_titlemf_workplace_romance/,2020-08-30T01:55:29Z,6,39,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
nawpf4,can anyone suggest an action/fantasy romance that my boyfriend would enjoy reading with me?,"we decided to read a romance book together (i.e. i'll read it out loud to him -- we've had a really good time doing this with other genres). i'm looking for something that he'd enjoy. he requested 'fantasy,' presumably something with action as well. i've read a couple stories to him before that had romance, but they were heavier on action and fantasy.

i want to read him something that has more romance elements! i think fantasy or scifi would be good (he's a fan of both) but i think there just needs to be some...excitement in the plot outside of just the characters' tension/interactions, if that makes sense.

books i don't think will work:

* things like [ACOTAR](https://www.goodreads.com/series/104014-a-court-of-thorns-and-roses) or armentrout's [blood and ash](https://www.goodreads.com/series/286233-blood-and-ash) series. the melodrama and lengthy clothing descriptions did not make the books entirely unpalatable for me, but i don't think he would endure quite as well as i did.
* regency romance. i've read [lisa kleypas](https://www.goodreads.com/series/41154-wallflowers), [sarah maclean](https://www.goodreads.com/series/210911-the-bareknuckle-bastards), [elizabeth hoyt](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16202.Elizabeth_Hoyt), and [anne gracie](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49243-the-merridew-sisters), and i had a great time. there is...some action, you know the kind -- someone getting shot, buildings burning down, etc., but i think we're looking for a plot that's more action/adventure-centered.
* modern romances. i love the [flatshare](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36478784-the-flatshare?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=KOJTh60789&rank=1), [love lettering](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44792512-love-lettering?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=RAIsH8SyoQ&rank=1), the [roommate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45023611-the-roommate?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=nlO1roMqmC&rank=1), the [hating game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25883848-the-hating-game?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=j7UOgeOBzg&rank=1)., but there is insufficient bloodshed in this kind of story.
* jane o'reilly's [second species](https://www.goodreads.com/series/239807-the-second-species-trilogy). i enjoyed parts of this series, but i feel like the romance aspect was really lackluster compared to the world-building and action scenes.

if you lovely people can't think of something, i was leaning towards [master of crows](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6811150-master-of-crows?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=o5ErxNsaPo&rank=1) by grace draven. i'm not totally sold on that one because i'm a little...weirded out by the characterization of the FMC, like the way she was described and the way others responded to her appearance (i don't want to spoil it for anyone that hasn't read it). i think that book has a good balance of action/fantasy/romance, though!

&#x200B;

edit: i also really love karen marie moning's fever series (i read it many years ago but only really started reading romance books late last year, so i totally forgot about it). it's great but i feel like there's...not enough of the romantic moments i'm looking for. i love a slow burn, but these two aren't even really romantic (compared to, say, your average regency era).

&#x200B;

edit part 2: we chatted more about potential books and came to the realization that urban fantasy doesn't sound super appealing, unfortunately. as i mentioned in a comment, we read stacia kane's downside ghosts a while ago, and he enjoyed those, but i feel like that book series was pretty unique.

patt0t,Can someone please help me find this book I’m desperate?!!!,"I’m not sure if I can post there here so sorry in advance if not. I’ve been trying to remember this title for a few months now. 
Last year before audible escape changed over to audible premium plus, I had listened to this book where the main character had took interest in the guy and someone who knew him warned her about the type of person he is. She wanted to know more so she joined this secret sex room to try and dig up more information about him. In there she met someone who wanted her to come to a secret club where people wear mask to hide their identity. When she gets there she sees that it’s a sex club and he’s there with someone else. Well she watches them do sexual stuff and I can’t remember all the details but it turned her on. So she goes to the bathroom and masturbates and the girl he was there with happens to hear her so she’s all embarrassed. Then this is where my memory gets a little sketchy. I think when she came out of the bathroom she ran into him but she has a mask on so he doesn’t realize or maybe just doesn’t say that it’s her. Then she decided to leave and what do you know he’s also leaving so they’re all in the elevator together and then when they’re out on the street waiting for their cars/Uber/taxi (I’m not sure) they’re talking and she’s trying to disguise her voice. He offers to give her a ride she declines. This is all I remember I hope that’s enough.

u389h8,"1) “She fell in love too early, he fell in love too late” type of book 2) help me add to my catalogs ( calling all the dark romance lovers)","I like books where the MMC hurts the FMC emotionally/physically/mentally. No I’m not talking about bully romances. I’m really tired of searching for hours just to find books I’m in the mood for so I’ve categorized this “trope”  into grades so I always have something to read later (with your help of course). 

1) dark romance (CR): MMC has psychotic/ violent tendencies (***but turn that energy to sex only), carries out his sick/twisted fantasies on FMC( usually because she’s “worthless”). S&M type of relationship. Unhealthy Obsession (one sided/or both). There’s usually a power dynamic. TOXICCC. Revenge. books that fit this: A) untouchable by Sam Mariano (humiliation kink] B) Lords of pain by Angel Lawson. can’t think of more. (I’m not even too confident that I picked the right books BUTT) 🥲 

2) Dark Romance: Mafia, fantasy, CR, Men with power, MMC doesn’t understand emotion (clinically psychopathic) . You REALLY don’t want to cross them. They’re calm and/ or sinister. Don’t fuck with them. Catching their attention is basically a d**thsentence. Pragmatic. At some point MMC wanted to off FMC( and he meant it). I.e. A) Run Posy Run (spoiler:::: when she’s sitting on his lap and he had the g*n to her head 💀) B) Harrow Faire (Simon and his damn strings and the horrors he had done with them). Book that doesn’t fit but has the vibe: the maddest obsession by Danielle Lori. (Basically FMCs in this category are tryna survive in a cruel world )

3) DARK ROMANCE: ACTUAL ENEMIES TO LOVERS. Both MCs are powerful. Villains . Political intrigue. TRAUMA(except they’re both responsible for each other’s trauma) . They do unthinkable things to each other. Sexual tension is 😮‍💨. Slow burn. M/M authors do this spectacularly Ie. A) Captive prince B) Call the coroner 

4)dark romance-ish(trig warning still apply though ): revenge + E2L + fantasy . Usually secret identity involved. Betrayal. It’s not in their nature to love the other. Soulmates hurting each other  : I.e primal sin by Ariana nash. Lifeblood by Amara Rae (except the writing wasn’t it 🥲) honorable mention : a Trixie towers series ) 

5) FMC imprisons MMC. “once I get out of here,  you’re de*d”. MMC is powerful so she uses him. Blackmail. I.e cruel prince, taming demons for beginners. Honestly we need more books with this trope. FMC brings untouchable MMC to his knees and he hates it. 

6) MMC Emotionally hurts FMC. MMC has no eyes for her+ repeatedly hurts her. Only book I can think of is NOX in broken bonds. Or MMC bets on her to fall in love because she’s unattractive. Heavy on the slow burn, and angst. Realizes what he lost when she’s gone. Grovel. Honorable mentions (separate beds by L. Spencer, One day in December by j.silver, before Jamaica lane) 

7) MMc uses FMC for his own personal gain (nothing sexual). He’s bad news. No moral compass whatsoever I..e  The fever series (spoilerrr: amount of times homegirl nearly 💀💀💀 and he DGAF. 


I feel like a broken record reciting the same books over and over again so I’m desperate for new ones 🥺 I want to discover new authors and books so please even sharing tips on how to find them would be helpful

y7nnqu,Gods of Jade and Shadow DEVASTATED me,"I finished the book *Gods of Jade and Shadow* by Silvia Moreno-Garcia in a rapid fire reading of 24 hours.

I absolutely loved this book and obviously, could not put it down.

The story follows both a fairy tale and hero's journey arc throughout. I have seen that this was a complaint of the book, but I found nothing wrong it this. In fact, it seems pretty explicit even within the story that the main characters, Casiopea (our hero Cinderella) and Hun-Kame (an ancient Mayan death god) are in the process of myth making. They even state how myths and the power of names and stories are what give life to the gods and that actions, symbolism hold power in the world.

When I picked up this book, I was thinking I was just going to get a fun adventure story set in the backdrop of Mexico with Mayan mythology turning the wheel of the plot. What I was not expecting was the slow building romance that emerged between the two characters.

Casiopea's infatuation with Hun-Kame is obvious from the very beginning but at first it comes off as just her uncomfortable shyness and innocence being around a man (especially as he first appears naked before her - though he is completely unperturbed by this). However, she may realize her attraction to him is growing, it only comes in whispers and looks and subtle clues that Hun-Kame is returning her desire.

How this is rendered is so beautifully done. It is a quiet sort of romance, where characters do not need to say I love you in order for it to be known and felt (my favorite kind of romance, to be sure). But ultimately, the access point to Hun-Kame's love for Casiopea is what is both destroying them both. Her mortality seeps into him and gives him a heart to beat and feel and dream for the first time; his reconstituted form however is what is slowly draining the life from Casiopea. Theirs is a doomed romance.

BUT - THE DEVASTATION COMES - when they are offered the choice to be together, it comes at the price of the world falling into death, suffering, and ruin. Hun-Kame is ready to cast off title and godhood to be in love, to be given a mortal name, and live his life for Casiopea. Oh, it is the wreckless, head-first plunge of young love, to see nothing in the world but your beloved and dive off the edge into world together....but what saves this book from being a YA story (I feel) is the very adult and heroic choice Casipoea makes - to give up this great love in order to save the world.

Oh my my my....I wanted them to be together so badly, but in our hearts as readers, we know that this is for the best, just like the characters learn. She is also after all only 18....(another poor symptom of these types of fantasy-romances, where an ancient and immortal male figure falls in love with someone barely out of childhood....). I think though that she is someone who is determined to live. She makes that determination at the end very clear and is ready to brave the world, no matter what may come. I'm sure there will be other loves, and maybe even more supernatural beings in her life, given the powers she receives and her hitching a ride with a demon.

I wished for an epilogue, only to peak a little more around the corner and see what her life was life. But many unquestioned answers remain for me. My criticisms of the book I think I have seen a few people mentioned - the character of her mother and father is underdeveloped as their own love story is transgressive and epic in its own right; I wish Mexico honestly played a bigger role in the story - and this is a criticism I have heard of her other book *Mexican Gothic*.

All and all, I loved this book very much and I hope one day to see, not necessarily a sequel (though I would love one - but the author is basically saying, not a chance), but I would LOVE to see this book captured in a visual form. It would be a beautiful animated film. An animation I think would be able to capture and interpret the underworld Xibalba and 1920s Jazz Age Mexico in a more real and vivid way than a live action movie could. I actually saw a lot of connections between this story and *Howl's Moving Castle* and I kept picturing the story in Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli style illustrations. In fact, the recent [new print of this book by Subterranean Press](https://subterraneanpress.com/gods-of-jade-and-shadow-preorder/) captures how beautiful, sensual, and captivating this story could be in illustrated form. I hope that one day this can happen and that more people will enjoy this wonderful story :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/y7nnqu/gods_of_jade_and_shadow_devastated_me/,2022-10-19T00:25:23Z,8,32,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
rgr46p,"Please help me remember book title. Read between 2004-2008, but it belonged to my grandma. Starts with FMC in a suit of armor protecting her castle. Her rescuers are actually mercenaries hired to kidnap her. She makes a deal with him to marry her instead and gain a castle in return. He agrees.","I am on the hunt for this for a few reasons. I'm trying to get more into romance and this is one I remember enjoying. I'd ask my grandma, but she passed quite suddenly from ALS a couple years ago. I tried asking my mom and she said she doesn't read romance. 

Here are the scenes I remember from it. 

FMC is small, long dark hair. MMC is tall, broad, with longer blond hair (and an estranged dad that's a replica of him). In the intro,  she falls in her suit of armor and it's so heavy she can't stand on her own. He thinks she's a man at first because of the armor. Then the kidnapping and marriage negotiation. 

After they start having sex, she goes to him and admits she didn't enjoy herself. He laughs at her at first, but then is quite bothered that he can't pleasure her, so he goes to a few ladies of the night he's slept with before for a few pointers. FMC catches him holding one of the women's breasts and thinks she caught him in adultery and tries to guilt him for something (I can't remember what). 

Then I have to assume the sex gets better. 

That's all I remember, I have to assume the people who initially hired the mercenary are not happy that he marries the girl instead, so I'm sure they are the ultimate antagonists, but I can't remember anymore. The estranged dad shows up at some point and we learn more of MMC's childhood/backstory, but the details are fuzzy. 

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Thank you! 

(My mom refers to the type of romance books my grandma read as smut, idk if that's a real distinction for romance readers, but I know the sex scenes were very descriptive.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/rgr46p/please_help_me_remember_book_title_read_between/,2021-12-15T05:05:51Z,6,20,RomanceBooks,Me Before You,POST
1ag2oii,Hear me out: recommend me must-read Kindle Unlimited books you wouldn't want to own or pay for,"Ok this is going to be long and make me seem overly picky but I promise I am just trying to be clear and detailed. I'll be happy with any recommendations.

**I am cutting KU from my budget.** I have a couple more weeks before my subscription runs out and I want to prioritize reading KU books. BUT specifically books that I would not want to pay for later, if that makes sense. This could mean a lot of things so I am going to attempt to break it down:

* **books that I might be embarrassed to own**. listen I have made huge strides in the last year with my comfort level in what I tell people I read, but we all have our limits and there are some books I am still too embarrassed to even rate on my romance-specific goodreads account. There are some books that as soon as I finish them I immediately return to Kindle Unlimited in case I die or my phone gets entered into evidence. I know there is still a record that I downloaded it somewhere but I would rather have that than a record that I paid for it.
* **novellas** that I feel are overpriced. I am a cheapskate. I do believe in paying for author's work but I do not believe in paying $5 for a 60 page novella no matter how good it supposedly is.
* **series**! Buying whole series tanks my budget, so if I can knock out a couple series before I have to pay for each individual book, that would be great.
* **books I might not like**. I try to broaden my horizons and push my comfort levels but sometimes that just doesn't work out. A nice feature of KU is being like, welp at least I didn't pay for that

Things I like: SFR, HR, CR, FR, aliens, marriage of convenience, pregnancy, time travel, survival, near-death experiences or sacrifices, caretaking, hurt/comfort, forced proximity

**Things I am iffy on (generally dislike but am open to reading more)**: age gap, sports romance, dubcon, dark romance, noncon, bully romance, fake dating. I don't really have triggers except I would like to be warned about death of a parent/parental figure

I have started to dip my toes into mafia romance so I am very open to your must-reads on KU

I have already read and liked most of Ruby Dixon, Heather Guerre, Claire Kent, Heather Fox, Victoria Aveline, Talia Rhea, Melanie Harlow, Bailey Brothers series by Claire Kingsley, Garrison Earth and Ash Planet Warriors by VK Ludwig, His Series by Aydra Richards, Wed by Scandal series by Stacey Reid

I want to prioritize novellas and series because I am more likely to buy a standalone after I get rid of KU. I'll take recs for standalones but please specify.

Please rec books that can only be read through KU. I am an avid library/libby user but most books published through KU are not available at libraries because Amazon sucks.

Thanks in advance!

s1o920,PLEASE can anyone help me look for this Female Alpha shifter book (action paranormal romance),"I'm looking for this book and I don't remember much on it, so some of the details I'll give might be a bit vague sorry about that! The book I'm looking for is definitely action paranormal romance.

 This book is about a female alpha shifter I'll call her **F** and I think she was a werewolf . I don't remember how to book started but I do remember that she can't shift into her other form in the first book or at least not until the end.

The main antagonist is a guy that I'll call **A**.  *I think* A was also an alpha werewolf and had been wrongfully taking humans which included the girl (most of them children I think) and biting them to ""turn"" them.

He specifically chooses his victims that had something dormant inside of them. It's some sort of crazy killing machine instinct? I don't know what to call it but they all had it. He chose them for that reason and when he bites them to turn them they all came out of it as an alpha. This all makes them very dangerous and basically a cabin filled with alphas ruled by one crazy alpha.  These kids weren't bad at all but because they were bitten they had to listen to A and his orders to kill and do other bad things.

I'm not sure how F escaped him but she found someone later on in the story and I forgot how things progressed. I remember this new guy which was probably her mate or something training her to fight. She didn't do well at first but then that thing dormant inside her awakened cuz she was getting beat up lol and it basically overrode every thought and movement she had.  She turned into this quick and precise type of assassin who only goes for the kill. It seemed almost like a reflex to her and she wasn't aware of what she was doing. She almost killed the other person she was training with. 

At the end of this book F goes off to fight with A but before they fight A orders his pack of alpha wolves to protect him. Somehow F snaps A's pack of wolves out of their trance or whatever and made them her pack. The pack of werewolves (who can't shift by the way) all attacked A and left nothing of him they basically ate him lol. So now confused F realizes she's their alpha. There's a bit at the end where she holds an actual infant werewolf just shushing it to sleep idk what else happened but I think that was part of the ending.

I thought I found it when I saw ***Wolf Fever (Alpha Project #1) by Milly Taiden*** but it wasn't it just in case someone gets mixed up with that one. 

Please tell me if any of this seems familiar to you :D

mdd2yj,Can you help me remember the titles/authors of several romance novels I've read?,"I usually see these types of posts with just one romance novel, but I have several books I'm trying to remember, and I figured one post would be better so that I don't spam this sub, hah.

I truly appreciate your help!

* Small town romance (in a midwest or western state...like Utah or Wyoming) about a high school reunion. I think the heroine is helping to organize activities for the high school reunion and the hero is some kind of celebrity or rich. I think the hero was really awkward when he was younger. I think on the first night of hero being in town, he sees the heroine at a bar and they dance. I *think* the town is trying to get the hero interested in investing in a shopping center or mall, but I'm not sure if that was in this book or not.
* Small town romance where a woman moves into a house she inherited. There's a guy in the town who turns out to be the villain and he wants to get the house. At one point the villain tries to run the heroine over with his car. I can't remember if the heroine is in a car at that point or if she's on foot. I'm pretty sure this is part of a series. I remember thinking everything was over-the-top dramatic. The hero starts sleeping with the heroine for protection. The villain definitely breaks in a few times and I think there's a big scene toward the end where he's broken in and ... kidnaps the heroine maybe?
* Historical romance that I believe is called something like The Mad Duke or The Duke's Madness or something like that. The hero loves collecting porcelain. I think they were these tiny, very delicate bowls...from China I think? I'm pretty sure the heroine does something like breaking one of his precious bowls, and I think it was part of how he realized he loves her. And I'm pretty sure the hero is on the Autism spectrum or OCD or something along those lines. This is definitely part of a series.
* Small town romance where the heroine needs a job really badly and dresses dude-like to get a job in construction. The hero is the boss of the construction project. I believe he and the heroine had a one night stand before she becomes his employee and once she becomes his employee she's off-limits to him. The construction project was at an old campsite, and the heroine gets her own cabin, thanks to the hero. The heroine doesn't have a car, so every weekend, she's stuck at the site alone. One weekend, the hero brings a group of friends to the site, where they find the heroine and include her in their fun-having.
* Small town romance where the hero is a big-time NFL player (he might retired?). The heroine works at a big hotel/resort and there's a lake that she swims in even though her boss doesn't want her to. The hero sees the heroine swimming in the lake and they talk. I *think* the heroine initially is snarky to the hero because he's there to...maybe buy the hotel? Or maybe she just assumed he's an asshole because he's famous? Either way, she thinks poorly of the guy before she's even spoken him. That's all I can remember, hope that's enough!
* Celebrity romance where a woman gets a job working for a very famous actor. He's a Hollywood heartthrob, and she can't believe she gets to work for him. She thinks he's so hot and wonderful. I think she's working a his house caretaker. I think maybe she lives in the guy's house. I believe she's from the midwest. She has a best friend who also wants to move to LA, and in the next book in the series, her best friend moves to LA and falls in love with some other hot big-time actor. That's all I can remember, hope it's not too vague.
* Small town romance where a woman moves into a Southern town, and the townsfolk don't want her and the hero together because the hero was married to (and is now divorced from) a woman who grew up in that town with the hero. I remember the beauty salon plays an important role in this. The heroine gets comments/threats at the salon. The salon comes up several times. I want to say maybe the heroine is a hair stylist, but I'm not sure. I remember the ex-wife expected the hero to get back with her, and she's genuinely surprised when she finally, belatedly realizes she won't get the hero back.
* Mature romance where the hero & heroine are divorced. She moves to a small town in New England I think. The hero and heroine both have kids and part of the book shows them struggling to see how their kids could blend. I remember there was a candle or decorative bowl that the hero's ex left behind. It came up a few times, and I think the hero's daughter has a freak out about it. This is sparse on details because I read a bunch of romance novels with divorced heroines in a row, and I think they're all melding together in my brain.

rftahf,You guys- i just lost my Kindle full of smut on an airplane 😬 Tell me your romance oopsies.,"Some poor Delta employee is about to get an eyeful. 

I dropped it as i was waddling off the plane, grabbed it and chucked it in my backpack, not realizing that the case was suspiciously light. Imagine my chagrin when i got to the other side of ATL and opened an empty case. Airline says they’ll ship it to me when (if) it turns up, but I’m honestly more concerned for whatever poor soul swipes that thing open and finds Christmas gingerbread demon erotica, a spanky Santa, fake boyfriends, and alien smut 🤣

13uw71y,Why TF doesn't 'It Ends with Us' have a trigger warning in the beginning?,"(forgive my language and rant) I see this book everywhere, I know there's a movie being made, and my sister in law had recommended it MULTIPLE times, so I finally broke down over this rainy memorial day weekend to read.  I probably put it off because this subgenre of romance wasn't normally my thing, but hell it's got to be popular for a reason, right? I loved the beginning, but the further I got into the book, honestly I wouldn't have finished if I didn't feel obliged because of it being my sister in law that recommended, and she was SO excited that I finally started it, and she's read so MANY of my suggestions.  The writing overall was pretty good, I liked multiple things, HOWEVER...I NEEDED a warning for graphic domestic violence!  Fuck, if I knew beforehand I would have stopped before I started OR at least been able to better prepare myself emotionally.  I lived off and on in a battered women's shelter as a child. The things that the main character describes from her childhood, WAS my childhood. Yes, I could have stopped reading at any time and I don't necessarily owe my SIL anything to have kept reading, but considering the number of people that are victims of domestic violence, I was just so taken back that there wasn't a trigger warning, like other books, going into this. 

*I read the kindle version

Edit: Since this post has gotten so much attention, I'll say this...Lol, I know now that CH is not for me. I guess I went into it blind and got emotionally hijacked. Lesson learned. I do understand that this book has a few years on it and is a mainstream publisher and that's probably why there was no TW.  Just surprised it was so popular considering. To each their own.  If someone is fortunate to not have that trauma or issues, good for them. The fact that people can't relate is a good thing.

sv3029,It Ends With Us - Rant and Review,"\*I'm aware this isn't a romance book. My post got removed in /YALIT which usually allows NA. So since I know most of this sub reads colleen hoover, i decided to post it here. once again, i am not advovating this as a romance.\*

&#x200B;

I’m not the only one who unfortunately fell in love  with Ryle alongside Lily, right? I didn’t care for him the first 80% of  the book, but after all that terrible abuse, he was so sweet and  remorseful to Lily and I could feel Lily’s pain in trying her best to  refuse him. It’s insane to think that if I was in Lily’s position, I  might’ve given him another chance 😭 and apparently so many other  readers would do so, too…

I guess  some of us still have Stockholm Syndrome together. It was great that the  author showcased that abusers aren’t always ugly toads, they’re  sometimes charming neurosurgeons with huge biceps and when they’re  sweet, those moments make you feel you can forgive them for what they’ve  done.

“It stops here, with me and  you. It ends with us.” I thought Lily said this to ryle before i read  this book.. But no, lily’s saying it to her daughter. That shes ending  the cycle of abuse that she and her mother went through, so her daughter  doesn't go through the same pain.. That is so heartwarming

So  Lily made the right decision in divorcing Ryle, but the ending and some  other things didn’t make sense to me? So I guess I’ll rant about that  and other stuff here

**The Ending**

Regardless  of the divorce, Lily still gives Ryle alone days to take care of their  daughter, which kind of defeats the purpose? Lily says she’s scared of  what Ryle could could do front of his daughter, so what if Ryle has a  temper tantrum when he’s with his daughter alone..? There is no evidence  that Ryle won’t be abusive to his child.. Like even Lily’s father  eventually hit Lily... I would not trust Ryle alone with him, and after  everything Lily went through,  I’m very confused on why she allows him  to. Is his sister there with him accompanying him when he's with the  baby? Knowing his abuse and how young the baby he is, he could  accidentally kill her in a fit of rage…

**Glorification of Rich People**

So  Lily says she hates rich people but not Ellen Degeneres because Ellen  does charity. She also emphasizes how as long as rich people do at least  some charity they’re not bad or unethical (such as her rich friend  Allysa who does charity). That’s such a simple outdated way to look at  things lol… I wonder if this reflects the author’s view or she even  regrets writing that. Rich people do charity to avoid taxes. You’re  gonna call Bezos ethical because he does charity yet underpays his  workers who aren’t even allowed bathroom breaks? Almost everyone has  heard of tax deductibles, like is Lily supposed to be naive or does the  author genuinely think like this?

“dO  yOu Do ChAriTy?” Lily asks this to Atlas at the end because it’s  apparently an indication if he’s a  fit for her or not.. people who  think like this are so naive and insufferable for their own good 😭

**Pop Culture References**

There’s  too many to count. But the way of viewing into Lily’s past is her  journal entries to Ellen Degeneres lmao?  And she emphasizes how  kind-hearted Ellen is and it’s interesting considering how recently it’s  revealed how Ellen treats her employees and celebs inhumanely behind  closed doors. I guess that’s the danger with using so many pop culture  references in books- they get outdated too quickly. The friendly, kind  image of Ellen that the author referenced to in her book just looks  foolish now.

**Ryle as an Abuser**

I  could pick up Ryle’s abusive traits rights from the start and that’s  why I tried not to like him. The way he violently kicked the chair, the  way he forcibly picked Lily up and locked her in his bedroom to kiss her  without consent, he started off as a typical YA abusive male lead. I  liked how the author subverted the trope and showed how men who are  violent don’t make a special exception to the women they “love”.

Ryle  and Lily have amazing chemistry and a lot of heart hammering romance  scenes, so I can see how readers fell in love with him, too. I know I  did, embarrassingly.

“I feel more  pain for that man out there, knowing what he went through as a child,  than I feel for myself. I'm supposed to hate him. I’m supposed to be the  woman my mother was never strong enough to be.”

“This could go one of two ways. He’s going to leave me or he’s going to hurt me.”

**Everyone Being Rich**

So  slmost every relevant character in this book is “self-made” rich and  it’s so annoying. Lily being middle-class and then becoming an overnight  successful flower shop owner, Ryle the rich neurosurgeon, Atlas from  homeless boy to owner/chef of an amazing restaurant, Alyssa’s husband  who was broke and now makes millions from making apps and she’s enjoying  his wealth, even Atlas’ friend is super rich and works at Altas’  restaurant for fun.

Also there’s  just some quirky coincidences that happen, like Allysa hasn’t worked a  day of her life and she’s mega loaded but she decides to bet on Alyssa’s  flower shop and they instantly become best friends and it just so  happens she’s Ryle’s sister so Lily and Ryle are forced to interact  despite wanting to avoid each other. These Wattpad esque situations,  they got me rolling my eyes to the back of my head

**Final thoughts**

Honestly,  it’s a great book about abuse that I recommend. The ending slightly  ticked me off because it contradicted what Lily wanted for her daughter  and I’m just worried if Ryle is going to hurt the daughter accidentally…  maybe another editor would’ve picked that issue up lol.

Also  its insane to think people after reading this book believe that Ryle  could have changed and Lily was wrong for leaving him.. . Ryle wouldn't  change just for you. He’s been doing therapy since he was six years old  and he still hasn't changed. He tried hard to change for Lily but his  anger overrules any of his logical thought, although he regrets it  later. It's sad but I dont think he will change ever. But that’s the  problem. Some abusers have great personalities while they're not doing  the abusing. But like Lily said, those 5 minutes of rage could do so  much more damage than 5 years of their kindness could ever cover to make  it up.

y7eoch,It Ends With Us and the depiction of abuse,"I'm writing this because I've seen multiple reviews stating that It Ends with Us romanticizes  abuse and my question is, why?

Don't get me wrong, I didn't like this book and I'm not trying to defend it, but this perspective left me confused. 

For me, even before I've read the Author's note it was pretty obvious the book doesn't support the abuse. Despite the fact the writing was bad (to put it lightly), the main idea as clear: girl falls in love with a charming boy, that boy isn't who she thinks, he starts abusing  her, she struggles, and she breaks up with him acknowleging the abuse. 

Personally I didn't like how the abuse was depicted, but I still don't think it's been romanticized. I might be wrong so I'd love to hear your opinions.

I like love triangles in a lighthearted story but this one sounds like it might be too angsty…Am I mistaken? 

Does anyone get emotionally destroyed at the end of this book? Am I going to be depressed or happy at the end? I don’t want bittersweet I want a real happy ending. 

If you’ve read it can you please let me know without spoilers if you think I should read it?

rn91cl,It Ends With Us - confused/frustrated about the god awful ending,"I really kept an open mind with this novel. I like cheesey romance and I like heavy subject matter. A book that does both is really intriguing- setting up expectations within a romance premise and then unraveling them. For that reason, I would give the first 75% of this novel a 3.5 or 4 star rating. 

But that ending makes no sense. When you take an abusive situation, add a baby and a divorce, things don’t just “work out” during a year long time jump, and then you get to start your new life with the man you always loved. 

Her staying in the apartment he had access to for the duration of the pregnancy?!? Dangerous! Him being in the delivery room?!? Dangerous! I completely thought they were setting the story up for more abuse to occur, rather than essentially wrapping his behavior up with a bow. 

The worst part for me is that I can live with a story where there’s no comeuppance or karma for the people who do wrong. But there needs to be a point made, and it needs to be made well: Justice comes in many forms (more than just a divorce) could have been the “point.” Or even “There is no justice to be found. life’s shit and then you die” would have been interesting. 

But having her suddenly happily coparent with a man who beat her and tried to r*pe her is completely unrealistic and does not jive with ANY theme previously discussed in the book. How does the same woman who asked him those questions in the hospital also allow him alone time with the child? Or tell a stranger about how their daughter has his eyes? The ending was simultaneously cotton candy happy fluff AND not satisfying at all. 

I saw no points made within that very rushed final chapter. If there was something in there I could not suspend my disbelief long enough to see it. What did you all get from the ending?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/rn91cl/it_ends_with_us_confusedfrustrated_about_the_god/,2021-12-24T00:02:39Z,50,146,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST
uad7oy,"Colleen Hover's ""It Ends with Us""","Okay, so I haven't read the actual book yet, but I did read a wiki summary of the book. I saw that this book was super popular on instagram and tiktok so I had to see what was up. People really love Ryle. I can see why. He's so handsome and he's a neurosurgeon which implies that he's smart. It's almost impossible not to be infatuated with him. But he's also abusive. 

The first thing that popped into my mind was how true it was that often the victims of IPV love their partners. That abuse isn't just this random act of violence by strangers or by ugly and despicable people. It often happens at the hands of people who are close to us and who we often love. These people usually aren't ugly or gross. Instead, they can seem to be well put together, kind, and respectable. That's what's so insidious about it.

ph83u9,Warning: It ends with us SPOILER.,"Hi everyone, not sure if this is allowed but I just recently finished It ends with us by Colleen Hoover and I was so disappointed by the ending and I just wanted to see if anyone shared my opinions on it as I haven’t really seen anybody think the same things as I did about the ending so again, there will be spoilers so don’t read this if you don’t want to know anything!!

So, the way Lily’s story with Ryle ended just really angered me. I hated that there was a redemption arc for Ryle. I mean he literally attempted to r*pe Lily and was extremely violent towards her on multiple occasions and it seems as if he just got away with it and got a pretty happy ending. I know Lily divorced him but is this really a fair punishment for all that he did? I just don’t think there should’ve been any sort of redemption. It made me feel like the author was trying to humanise the abusive actions of abusive people and invoke in the reader some sort of sympathy towards them because of the mention of the traumatic event in his childhood and the fact that it now causes him to have ‘blackouts’. I just feel that there was no redemption arc to Lily’ father’s character so we could better understand why he may have abused Lily’s mother so why was there one for Ryle? An abuser is an abuser in my mind. 
I don’t know, I feel like I needed to vent about the ending just because it annoyed me so much and I’d really like to hear other people’s opinions on it so I can better understand why the author wanted Ryle’s story to end this way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/ph83u9/warning_it_ends_with_us_spoiler/,2021-09-03T16:02:29Z,29,90,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST

sq8i1x,"How do you feel about ""it ends with us"" getting a prequel ""it starts with us""?","Colleen hoover announced that she's going to be releasing Atlas's pov in a new book ""it starts with us"". What are your thoughts/feelings? There's another post about this (as of the time I'm writing this) on this subreddit, but it was more for announcing it, rather than discussing it. 

I read ""it end with us"" in November and, yes the book has stuck on my mind better than some other books. I feel like the authors note at the end made the book more powerful in message however I still have complaints about the book. The next paragraph will be my thoughts about Atlas and the part that I'll put in quotation marks will be what I wrote in a comment of a post that was discussing ""it ends with us"", my general thoughts about Colleen Hoover and the book and how people view it.


My biggest complaint about how the book ended was Lily ending up with Atlas. The book was Lily's story and I'm not saying that at the end, when she's not in a relationship with Ryle anymore (thank god) that she can't move on or rather move backwards to Atlas. My issue is that we don't really know Atlas in the present. Yes, we do spend some time with him, but the book never truly talks about how he's changed other than that he now has a restaurant and a big house. And that's okay, because again, it's Lily's story. But if you're going to make her go back to someone, I would expect that we know that person. But we don't. Not really. We know young Atlas. I know that many won't agree, but this is something that I think about a lot. To be clear I don't think Atlas is a bad person or that he's really changed personality wise, I'm just saying that Lily, who has gone through a abusive relationship would be more cautious stepping into a new one especially if she hasn't known that person for a few years. 

""I think that people in general have put Colleen's books on a pedestal. Yes, it ends with us is not a romance. It's a book about an abusive relationship. The marketing for this book starting with the description is all misleading. It looks like a romance from the cover and I believe many have read it thinking it was because nowhere does it say where it will go since it's supposed to be a ""plot twist"".
Colleen does this in her books. She writes sad/tragic romance books and gets applauded for it (now mainly because of tiktok), but yet it's not really revolutionary. Many authors write sad/tragic romances, they're books just haven't gotten tiktok recognition. I hadn't heard of Colleen until the start of 2021. Tiktok has really helped her career which is great, but I think people need to realise that she's not a game changing writer. I liked it ends with us, but as the book itself I didn't connect to it all that much. Mainly because the writing just felt cheesy even though dealing with a heavy topic the sentences sounded like they're from a regular romance. I didn't sob whilst reading it. I shed about like 2 tears, but what actually hit me was the authors note. THAT was impactful. For that I shed one more tear.
Right after IEWU I read ugly love. I enjoyed the process of reading it more, but I realized I didn't like the book that much after a week had gone by. Between the two it ends with us has stuck with me more and I do truly think it's because of the authors note. 

Conclusion: I think that Colleen's books got hyped up a lot on tiktok. A lot of people were mislead to think that it was revolutionary. Some people were mislead to think it ends with us is a romance. 

The truth is Colleen writes books a lot of people enjoy and that's okay, but that doesn't mean that she doesn't write what so many writers write as well. ""

Final thoughts: I probably will buy the book when it comes out. Especially since it's technically a fix to my not knowing Atlas problem. However I don't think that this was a passion project, because if it was I feel like it would have come out a year or two after ""it ends with us"" not six years later, when the book has blown up. I'm not saying that it's definitely a cash grab, but it sorta feels like it.

s0oyb8,It Ends With Us,"I read this book bc many people said it was their favourite and I can see why, but it didn't work for me.

Things I liked:

1. Coleen Hoover talked about a very important issue and more people should be educated on it and not be so judgemental of the victims. My first response to scenarios like that used to be ""Didn't they see what was happening? Why did they allow it?"" until I read about the case of a woman a few months ago. I thought the reasons they didn't leave were financial, but turns out it's more than that.
2. Her Mum found someone to love her like she should be loved

Things I didn't like:

1. The dialogue was a little cringey at times, especially in the beginning.
2. The characters didn't really feel like real people.

s34k5m,"My Take On ""It Ends With Us"" by Colleen Hoover","**I read this book over the summer of 2021, and I was utterly disappointed by the ending. It's now been trending on TikTok for a little while, and all of the posts are talking about how amazing the book was. I've read almost all of Colleen's books, but this one just left me upset (for numerous reasons). Here is an essay I wrote for my English class.**

***It Ended With Them***

I have read at least eight novels by Colleen Hoover, and while in my mind she is known for cliche (yet fulfilling) endings, there is not a single conclusion that has left me as disappointed as *It Ends With Us.* Though it is important to note that the book is based on Hoover’s own experiences with an abusive childhood, I cannot help but feel incomplete towards the story she has created.

It is difficult to address the ending of the novel without diverging into all of the different aspects of Lily Blossom Bloom’s life that have led her up to that moment. Lily grew up in a home with an abusive father, who would only ever harm his wife. Lily confided in an unusual friend -- a homeless boy named Atlas Corrigan who took shelter in the abandoned house next door. Even though Atlas was kind-hearted and clearly cared about his new friend, he was an 18-year-old who relied on a 15-year-old for survival. A mere high school student who had enough problems going on at home was now providing a bed (her own), meals, and emotional support for an older boy. Although Lily would consider Atlas her first love, he should have remained a piece of her childhood.

Throughout almost the entire novel, Colleen Hoover paints Lily Blossom as a female who has always found herself through men. Her later boyfriend and eventually husband, Ryle Kincaid, proves to take after her father, and hurts her at the hand of his uncontrolled rage. However, before the epilogue took place, I felt a sense of hope for Lily. She seems to finally appreciate how far she has come from the reliant teenager she was, and is able to separate her own life from Ryle’s as she expects a soon-to-be-born baby girl. “Sometimes it seems easier to just keep running in the same familiar circles, rather than facing the fear of jumping and possibly not landing on your feet. My mother went through it. I went through it. I’ll be damned if I allow my daughter to go through it” (361). She finally finds her own voice and divorces the father of her child, whom she still loves, and never allows the chance for her child to face toxicity that she had been forced to grow up with. During my first read, I thought she would end her story exactly where she started: alone. I was proven wrong, as she ended her narrative with her child. “‘It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us’” (361). Lily has become reliant on herself.

The disappointment hit as I turned the page to the epilogue. Lily is bustling through the streets of Boston with her daughter, and she finds herself face to face with Atlas. She immediately runs into the arms of her first love, just as she did when she was in high school. At the end of the main part of the book, she said “it ends with us,” but it almost feels as though she lied to her daughter. Is it really ending with her and her daughter if she allows Atlas back into her life?

The only excuse I can give Colleen Hoover for this ending is the fact that love is unpredictable and can be thrown at you from any direction. But by concluding the novel with Atlas, it is almost like Lily has made no progress. I thought the message being conveyed was that it is important to depend on yourself because other people will always disappoint you. Her father was never the person she thought, Atlas left her when she needed him the most, and Ryle brought her back to her childhood - crying in her bedroom, helpless. After all this time we spent focusing on Lily’s self-growth, she sacrifices it again to be with Atlas.

After thinking about it for a long time, I think the real message Hoover is trying to communicate is that life is not always linear. You don’t start at one point and eventually reach the top. We are shoved into situations we are not ready for and have to navigate them on our own. I will just have to trust that Lily and Atlas belong together, and that Colleen has enough faith in them for the two of us.

oz93xz,"Just finished It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover, and Wow...","TW : >!Sexual Abuse!<

I kept putting this book in the back burner due to seeing so much hype on tiktok, which kind of ruins the book for me, but wow. This book was so eye opening.

I am now a freshmen in college studying psychology and all throughout my studies in high school, I never once got an inside view/thought of abuse like I did from Lily.  I really thought abuse was black and white. In a way, I thought like Lily during the first part of the book. She didn't understand why her mother couldn't leave  her father and the frustration of Lily grew just as it did for me. 

Throughout my whole life, I've been lucky to never experience a relative, friend, or family member who gone through abuse which made me more conspicuous to abuse. I was too young and naive to believe that there were other reasons that people stayed with their abusers. Simply, I thought that one would know what abuse is and ask for help when needed. As I grew older, I understood there were other factors but couldn't comprehend the costs of staying with the abusers' overweighing leaving them. 

But once I read this book, it all made sense to me. The way Lily described her love for Ryle was heartbreaking because we all knew that even though it may work out, Ryle would continue and Lily would suppress herself, telling herself that he loved her again and again like her mother. She knew that it might have been bearable for her to be near Ryle again and to see the good in Ryle instead of the bad. She still missed him, cares for him, and loves him with all her heart but if she were to go back and continue, she knew that she would see her mother in herself which was the last thing she ever wanted to be. >!(Before when her mother told her that Ryle should not take her if he truly loved her) !<

The part when Lily made Ryle realize that he would tell her own daughter to leave in Lily's situation, I cried so hard. Lily was brave and strong enough to protect herself and her own daughter. 

I now understand why it's so hard for people to leave because its the thought of that ""They promised they would never do this again. "" and boundaries being broken over and over again. Its so easy to tell yourself that, that was just the bad parts of the person and that there are so much better things about them. It's so easy to love them and the hate is just for a second. That it's bearable for that moment. 

This book truly changed my thoughts and I am so excited for another book to open my eyes on other topics.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/oz93xz/just_finished_it_ends_with_us_by_colleen_hoover/,2021-08-06T15:37:14Z,19,24,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST
qz2vvy,Why is the love story in It ends with us so wrong?,"I am not referring to Lilly and Ryle. That was CLEARLY a huge mistake of Lilly. She was completely aware since the beginning that the guy was a freak (telling her phrases about sex since the very first minutes they met). She knew since the beginning he was no good guy.

&#x200B;

What I mean is that the story between Lilly and Atlas is SO WRONG. Teenage Lilly deserved someone like Atlas. They were so cute and tender,made for each other.

&#x200B;

What was wrong is that Atlas was too good for her. While he looked for her she was in college having her hook ups with other guys. Shallow stories but she ended uo having sex with them. Same for Ryle. She ended up with him only for the sex. The scenes were so hard to read. She was just being used by him and let him willingly do that. Like a cheap w\*\*\*\*. Sorry to say it but it was no longer the shy and innocent teenage Lilly. And then after all the sex she gets pregnant and guess who has to accept the little ba\*tard child?  Atlas. Poor Atlas.

He is just a saint and she doesn't deserve him. At all. Lilly deserved him if she hadn't willingly had sex with all those boys after him. It's just so wrong and makes me feel sick for him.

&#x200B;

But in real life is like this. Crazy rich spoiled alpha male has sex with cute girl, gets her pregnant,nice guy forgives her and raises the b\*\*\*\*\*\*child.

I would have never accepted such girl for a wife and such child.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/qz2vvy/why_is_the_love_story_in_it_ends_with_us_so_wrong/,2021-11-21T19:52:14Z,21,0,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST
qsm9px,"Calling ""It Ends With Us"" by Colleen Hoover a romance novel is misleading... (possible unpopular opinion?) **Spoilers**","So I just devoured It Ends With Us by CH, and I want to preface this by saying I really, truly loved this book. Atlas is one of my favorite heroes to date. But when I finished the book and I set it down I found myself wondering  ""*was this book really a romance?*"" Now by all definitions, the simple answer is: yes. It focuses on a romantic relationship between two individuals, and that relationship is the driving force behind the novel. Boom. Done. Romance novel, right?

But on the other hand, I felt misled. I went into this book BLIND, which is partially on me. By the end, it felt more that I was reading about a woman's journey toward self-discovery, forgiving her mother, and healing childhood trauma more than it really was about finding a romance. The book was about love, but not just romantic love. It dealt with family cycles, abuse, forgiveness, and so much more. Not to mention, the hero and heroine do not even get together until the very last page of the novel. The hero is actually not in the book much at ALL. 

I do not want to come across as saying that romance novels do not cover heavy topics. I've read over fifty this year, and trust me, they DO. But normally, they are tackled within the realm of the relationship between the real hero and heroine. Normally, the two are together (or in the process of doing so) for the majority of the book as opposed to this one. It is really the lack of a lot of pages of the hero and heroine together that made me feel like I was not reading a traditional romance novel. There is a part of me that feels like you could remove Atlas from this story altogether and it would result in the same message coming across. That is why I think calling it a romance is somewhat misleading, I hope that makes sense. 

I think a lot of people might disagree with me, but I'm not sure. Maybe I have too narrow-minded of a view toward this genre. It was just something interesting I thought about and wondered if others felt similarly. Overall regardless of what genre it fits into ""best"" it is a wonderful book that I am glad I finally got around to reading!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/qsm9px/calling_it_ends_with_us_by_colleen_hoover_a/,2021-11-12T22:13:26Z,26,80,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST

rxch48,It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover MESSED with my worldview AND made me realize some things about my OWN family.,"… among all the books I read in my whole life, this was one of the best ones. I have so many things to say about this book but I find myself unable to properly organize my thoughts. 

I’ve been meaning to read this book for months. Going in, I knew **the FMC was in an abusive relationship. By the end of it, she gets out.** That’s all I knew. 

This book… it spoke to me, it resonated with me because… well, I understand, okay? Not being in an abusive relationship but what it feels like to be a child of an abusive relationship. I read the author's note in the end and, well, unlike the author’s mom but VERY MUCH like Lily's mom, MY mom never divorced him. Do you know why? She told me, multiple times, **it was because of me.** She doesn’t have financial stability. She has children. My feelings for my father are… **I think he’s a good father and I think he’s a horrible husband.** He’s never treated ME badly but that’s not the point. The point is the way he treats my mother, he doesn't *hit* her but emotional abuse if just as awful. 

I’m sorry, I am making this all about me instead of the book but I needed to say WHY this book resonated with me. It’s because **whenever there was a scene from Lily’s journal, I found it was REALLY easy to relate.** *Because I’ve experienced the exact same thing.* Well, except that my father never stopped while I was there and my mom had always cried to me about him and how horribly he treats her, while Lily's mom always pretended it was fine and swept it all under the rug. 

When Ryle was introduced and they had their romance, I kept searching for signs of abuse. I couldn’t really find them. I was actually starting to get confused. And then the hand burning happened and I confused *myself* because **a small part of me actually wanted her to forgive him** because I could see how very clearly he was contrite. This was my thought process: *It WAS an accident. As much as it reminds Lily of her father, Ryle didn’t really do it intentionally. Like he said, he panicked. It was something instinctive. He couldn’t control it. And he’s different. He’s NOT her father. This is a completely different situation!* Here's the thing... my thought process also SCARED me because... really? ME, the reader, the one who isn't even going through this is already so affected she can't walk away. NO WONDER the ones actually there find it hard...

Anyway, after that, when she did forgive him, I wasn’t really all that mad… but then the next time, when she started justifying it, going through the EXACTLY same process I did, my stomach started sinking. I felt sick. **I wanted her to get out, to call Atlas, do something!** And then, of course, the third time… I was so glad she left him. 

I wasn’t expecting Lily to have a dad who was abusive considering SHE was supposed to be in an abusive relationship. I was thinking, **how would she end up in one after what she’s already seen?** 

*Remember how she used to think?* She said that she used to think it’d be easy and simple, just leave if he ever mistreats her but it ended up not being easy after all. She said that she used to think the women who wouldn’t leave were stupid. A part of me thought the same way but thanks to this book, I no longer think this way. 

On a much lighter note, can we just talk about Atlas and how utterly ADORABLE he is?! I want an Atlas in my life… really, I NEED one. He's so CONSIDERATE and THOUGHTFUL. That scene where he tells her to fall in love with HIM if she's ever ready to fall in love... it was SO SWEET!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/rxch48/it_ends_with_us_by_colleen_hoover_messed_with_my/,2022-01-06T11:32:09Z,20,111,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST

wdbj7h,Finished It Ends With Us on Thursday and still thinking about it,"I never write reviews on books .But I'm gonna say this book made me feel so many emotions. Maybe all kinds of  it . I'm still thinking about it. Trying to determine myself and my feelings. I always used to make everything black and white .So that it becomes easier for me to read a book .But in this book ,I couldn't do that .I feel that's what made it so sad for me .
I saw so many people raving about the book on social media .Making Lily- Atlas goals which made me think it's a love story between Lily and Atlas where Ryle comes for a while as a villain. Well , in short it was kinda that .But I felt it was much more than just a love story . People used to tell me it's a sad book . That's why I thought maybe its like The fault in our stars . Maybe I'll just cry at the end of the book .But man , the book was definitely heavy .It made feel down the whole time almost .It was depressing.Social media totally mislead me about this book . 

In the first half , I was just feeling bad for Atlas and rooting for him .Ryle grew on me afterwards.I have never been so conflicted about a character as I was about Ryle's character. I loved Lily so much .Maybe she is the strongest female main character I've read yet . She is brave and bold. I liked the ending also. It may not be a HEA but it was good . There are many lines from the book which struck with me . I thought it was  more Lily and Ryle's story.

jrvxv1,Have you read It Ends with Us by Colleen Hoover? How would you rate it?,"⚠️ Warning: NonHEA, I wouldn’t even consider this a romance even though it’s written just like a romance with the romance tropes and sex and everything until, um, horrible stuff happens. 

Also, TW: >!abuse!<

I got on this book thanks to u/Pacreg86’s fantastic nonHEA thread. 

I just finished this book yesterday and I can’t get it out of my head. I bawled the most in the goddamn author’s note of all places. She wrote this meaningful book from her mother’s own experiences 😭

Also, people who have DNFed this book due to the rampant wish fulfillment fantasy in the first half (not to yuck anyone’s yum, it’s just that some people aren’t into that), trust me, I totally get that. I was about to DNF myself. But just don’t judge this book by the first half is all I can say. It has incredible depth and meaningfulness in the second half.

I never really highlight in romances. It’s my guilty pleasure escapist genre. But I had yellow markers all over this book. SO MANY QUOTABLE QUOTES. 😭

The part of the actual story that had me bawling the most had to have been when >!after labor Lily decides on divorce with such clarity and Ryle is weeping with their baby in his hands. It was honestly such a beautiful and sad and empowering scene, of firmly saying NO.!<

Ending this with a IRL quote by Colleen Hoover:

*”I don't like to be confined to one genre. If you put me in a box, I'll claw my way out.”*

hcgxal,It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover- Review/Summary- DOESN’T SPOIL OVERALL THEME,"“All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.” - It Ends With Us

Wow. I would like to start off by saying if you have not read this book, do it. Personally, it is not only the best book I have ever read, but it also surpasses every TV show I’ve ever watched and most movies I’ve seen. I do not want to spoil all this book entails for those of you who decide to give it a read and like to be surprised just as I like to, but here is a glimpse without revealing the plot...Not only is this book a fictional romance, but it is also somewhat biographical. It’s informative on a current, painful theme we see in our world today and most people are not fully educated on. Many people hear about these incidents happening in life, whether it is someone they personally know or even just hearing about someone else going through it, but numerous people do not understand the struggles of the people involved. 
I lay here. Tears falling down my face. So many emotions pouring out of me as I finish reading the last sentence of this book. This novel is extremely empowering. It broke my heart several times. Hurt, happiness, and everything in between. The ups and downs that the main character goes through is so powerful and it teaches many lessons including making the right choice, no matter how hard the decision is to make.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/hcgxal/it_ends_with_us_by_colleen_hoover_reviewsummary/,2020-06-20T06:07:13Z,15,15,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST

I never read cover jackets. I generally pick books up from recommendations, authors I like already, and/or genres I'm currently diving into. That being said, I walked into this book blind. Picking it up last minute, because it was part of a deal at BN.

What I thought was going to be a romance book of a girl finally accepting the loss of her first love, for the love of a new man, turned into surviving domestic abuse and being strong enough to break the cycle.

This book made me relive my own DA. With as much as I read, DA isn't unheard of in books. I didn't have much of a rise, until the last incident and Lily's trip to the hospital. But boy did it rush me then.

The tipping points for all survivors is different, but I felt a connection to Lily with hers. And I couldn't help drawing the connections between our experiences. A couple moments felt like Colleen was writing about my life.

I know the ending seemed to end well, but I couldn't help but be disappointed with it. It just felt like Ryle was given such a pass, and it didn't sit right with me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/q0xqfi/it_ends_with_us_by_colleen_hoover_hit_me_in_all/,2021-10-04T03:51:13Z,5,13,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST

y7p1qf,I read “it starts with us”,"Before I start, I know that ‘it ends with us’ has very mixed feelings across the entirety of the internet. I did like the book overall, I read it on my honeymoon and cried like a baby on the beach. When I realised she was releasing the sequel, I was over the moon and I preordered it. It came today, I sat down for three hours and read the whole thing in one go but here’s the thing.. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. 

I had such high expectations for this book and I knew it had such potential however I felt that it fell so far below my expectations. There was no plot whatsoever, I was waiting for the plot twist to come but it never did. It felt like a poorly written fanfic you’d find on wattpad. I could tell that Colleen had no interest in writing the book and that she had purely done it for the money and the hype involved. 

Atlas had no character depth, we find out more about his life but nothing actually contributes to him as a character. There was barely any mention of other characters and when there was, yet again there was no depth to anyone. 

The romance was a slow burn (don’t get me wrong, I LOVE a good slow burn) but the characters didn’t even kiss until 2/3 of the way in and all of a sudden we go from 0 to 100 real quick. It just didn’t feel realistic. 

We also see Lilly being all of a sudden very protective over her daughter (understandable) but the end of ‘it ends with us’ Rule gets unsupervised time with Emmy. I didn’t feel like it smoothly followed on from the previous book at all. 

There was so much wasted potential. I’m not sure whether it was because I had built the excitement up so much or not but I felt so disappointed after reading it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/y7p1qf/i_read_it_starts_with_us/,2022-10-19T01:29:13Z,26,33,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST

1548wtn,I read fourth wing and I didn't like it,"So I read fourth wing by rebecca yarros a few days ago and it was meh for me. 

I love the fantasy genre, the world-building, the characters, the magic, I love it all. But reading fourth wing felt like romance flavoured watered down fantasy. 

I am not skilled enough to parse what exactly was wrong with the story, but something always felt off, like the insta-love type situation with the main characters when it was supposed to be enemies to lovers? The characters of xaden and violet were one-dimentional and the development of romance between them felt strange. I didnot feel the chemistry at all and most of their interraction felt performative. So many times it felt like the author was telling us to believe 2+2=22

I liked the stuff with the dragons but because we only see the story through violets perspective, the world felt small and not rounded out. 

And the two dragons thing, boys falling all over each other for her, along with a lot of other stuff that I am forgetting felt Mary Sue-ish to me. As I said one-dimentional characters all around. 

Speaking of 1D characters, Dain Aetos, what the hell was up with his relationship with Violet. She couldn't stand up for herself one bit and it left me frustrated to no end. You are telling me that they have known each other since childhood and his controlling tendencies have only reared their head now? I get the fear he must have felt for Violet but him assuming she is stupid and incapable is pushing it. What was the point of him anyway? Foil to Xaden? The betrayal angle was so ham-fisted, I was praying for the book to end. 

I think that covers most of the complaints I have with the book.

Now if anyone has any well-written fantasy recommendations, with fleshed out characters and good world building please don't hesitate to send them my way.

oq5jsm,Is it just me who loves the “cliche” tropes in romance books?,"As someone who loves her romance novels, cliche is really what does it for me after a days hard work or as an escape from a sad moment. 

The alpha male with a 6”2 physique, extremely good looks, family issues and a troubled back story. He’s a billionaire and Harvard graduate at 25 and is misunderstood. Either a playboy or a private man whose changed by the cheerful FMC, bringing him out of his shell and putting his broken pieces back together. 

And of course the extremely beautiful FMC whose happy go lucky yet always goes through difficult times, just lost a job or went through a horrid breakup where her partner took everything from her house down to her underwear. Yet she is still optimistic and kind and all in all good, still offering her last ramen noodles to the homeless guy outside her shitty apartment. 

They meet and start a rocky relationship, it’s either they sleep with one another and accidentally fall in love despite not wanting to, or a great enemies-lovers where the slow burn builds up to a final kiss. 

Then comes the inevitable curveball where the MC (mostly) messes up and gives a grand gesture of grovelling to make the FMC forget. Soon arrives a cute epilogue where they have their happily ever after. 

The reason we may love this so much is the fact that it’s an escape from reality. It gives us hope that we may too have our happily ever after. The FMC represents what we want to be, beautiful and loved by an amazing perfect man. She gets a companion to cherish her in loneliness, maybe something she lacked growing up, (those who can relate will love these books more).A happily ever after is what everyone wants and that’s what these books give.We get a sense of satisfaction being in her shoes getting someone who is handsome, rich and loving to the utmost core. It’s a great escape from reality, (not that this applies to every one). 

It also gives us extremely high standards of what we want, which is good and bad. Because we might end up lonely and dreaming, but it’s also sweet to wait to get what you deserve. The only thing is don’t let your “one” slip when the time comes thinking you can get a Billionare CEO who treats you like shit and then a queen at the end of it all. If stories like these were true then the world be scattered with thousands of young capable CEO’s who look like Henry Cavill. 

That doesn’t mean I don’t love to change it up a bit! All kinds romance is nice, from fantasy to a sad ending. I particularly loved ‘It Ends with Us’, so so good and so different from normal, which is refreshing if written well, which Colleen Hoover definitely has. 

I would never ever stop reading these books as long as writers don’t stop, there’s never too much fluffy cliche romance in the world. No matter how amazing Titanic is we still go back to Disney channel and watch that Shrek re-run. Its like a blanket during a cold winters night in front of a fireplace, comfortable cosy and content, even it is for a night. 

Ps. I wouldn’t mind a few recommendations! Especially workplace slow burn enemies to lovers ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/oq5jsm/is_it_just_me_who_loves_the_cliche_tropes_in/,2021-07-23T16:07:08Z,50,275,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST
1bal7vw,"Romance books and the ""it reads like a YA book"" statement","This statement is something that I've seen being described with the hot and/or current romance books that are out on the market.

So, in the main Fantasy subreddit, there was a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1b4reav/discussion_imo_being_able_to_identify_a_books/) that discussed a specific pattern in the general book community, which is described in the title:

> Being able to identify a book’s target audience and determining if you are part of it are basic reading comprehension skills that are seem to be on a sharp decline.

The user, VertGodavari, describes this phenomenon, which is also talked about in the post:

> I think looking at a book and determining if it is for you or if you can enjoy it is pretty much a required skill before attempting it, and **if you’re way outside the range of its demographic I don’t think you’re really valid in posting a scathing review.** Well, I guess you can; but I don’t know why anyone would listen to it or care.

> This is true for any other form of media, but reading seems to be in this weird space where someone decides that just because they’ve enjoyed a book or series that means they enjoy READING as a whole and all books from then on are equal fair game for them and share expectations.

> I don’t know why this is on the rise now, could just be the wave of nostalgia posting / childhood stuff seen more on TikTok and similar media lately, but **it’s really annoying to see thread after thread of grown men discussing why a YA romance book is trash in their opinion or a bunch of 20-somethings saying Harry Potter doesn’t have a complex enough plot.**

> **Not everything is for everyone; this is not something to get worked up over. Spaces like this sub get overwhelmingly negative when this attitude gets prevalent.**

Now, the comments underneath the post specifically discuss Young Adult books and the genre, but this also applies to Romance as well. 

For a notable example, college romance books or romance books having characters that are 18-19 years old or in their early 20s. There are people out there who do enjoy those books that are or aren't part of the demographic. But, because of how prevalent those kinds of books are within the romance space, I've seen negative comments and rants regarding those kinds of romance books, saying that it's bad, trash, all this type of stuff.

Another prevalent one is with dark romance, specific romance tropes, or age gap romance books. I won't even get into that discussion because....it's a lot, I'll just say that. 

Adding onto this, the user, sarahlynngrey, made a comment under the post that had me nodding my head in agreement with the whole thing:

> Usually when people say a book ""feels YA"" but it isn't YA, **they're using ""YA"" as a proxy for something else, like ""accessible and easy to read prose"" or ""simpler plotlines that would appeal to a less experienced reader."" If this is the case for you I really encourage you to just say those things instead of using ""YA"" as a mildly derogatory label.**   

> As somebody else mentioned, **female writers/books disproportionately get mislabeled as YA all the time, as do ""easy to read"" books that are designed for an adult audience.** It's exhausting and doesn't help people find the books they want to read.

There are a couple of [different](https://pagesunbound.wordpress.com/2019/01/25/miscategorizing-adult-books-as-ya-discussion/) [articles](https://bookriot.com/?p=252317) about this discussing on how on Goodreads, there are readers that have been putting adult books like The Night Circus, The Poppy War, Uprooted, amongst others into the YA category, when they're actually Adult works.

And this stuff *still* happens to this day.  Again, this also applies to Romance.

It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover isn't YA, neither is the ACOTAR series, or Haunting Adeline, or The Fine Print, The Twisted Series, The Love Hypothesis, Fourth Wing, Penelope Douglas's books, etc! 

And it isn't just these book. From the popular romance books to self published ones, they have all at one point have been described in phrases such as: ""It reads like a YA"", ""It reads like a 13 year old wrote it"", ""I've seen better writing from 12 year olds"", etc. It feels like some people out there don't want to say that a book is easy to read, so they just uses these phrases instead of saying that the book is, well, an easy, breezy read. 

Or as some comments I've seen out there call them, popcorn and/or potato chip reads, the analogy being that they're accessible, light, and quick reads.

Overall, I've noticed about how there are romance books out there being referred to as how it ""reads like a YA"" or ""reading like a YA"" and thought back to the post in the Fantasy subreddit. In the case of Romance:

-A reader describing a romance book that ""reads like a YA"", when it's catered towards a different demographic than their own

-A reader stating that a romance book they finished going through the pages of  ""read like a YA""  when the book has a simple writing style and easy to read prose

But yeah, I'm curious as to what everyone's thoughts on this are. And have you also noticed this pattern before when it comes to romance books?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1bal7vw/romance_books_and_the_it_reads_like_a_ya_book/,2024-03-09T16:11:45Z,47,96,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST
vv9xsp,DNFed Den of Vipers- super shocked it was this bad considering it had nearly 19k reviews,"Anyone else here just vehemently hated this book? I got to chapter 8 and just...I couldn't do it. I love dark romance, but this was just so difficult to wade through.

I mean...Getting boners at the idea of >!burning someone alive!<?? Being excited at the idea of>! Gang rape!< and having absolutely NO remorse or upset about it whatsoever? Blatant, obvious hints that they've done this to many other women and felt nothing but excitement and joy?

Look- I am all for my mafia romances. The dark. The dirty. The grimy- but the baseline in many of those books is that the bad guy isn't REALLY bad, he just fell into the family business/wrong crowd and has a complex of not showing his sweet side due to the trauma of working as he is/needing to be tough to maintain his image to his clan/gang/whatever. The entire arc is the FMC breaking down his walls, allowing him to be vulnerable, and growing together as a couple. Its the bad boy turned good because you are so special as a woman vibe. Love that shit. Plus there's always a ""I have to save your life"" scene, which we all look forward to and love. THIS BOOK? NOT AN IOTA OF THAT!

I tried to slug through as best as I could despite:

1. Hating how horribly cheesy details are. A bar owner who runs the place wearing HEELS all day? bitch, please. How did you think any woman would read that and go ""huh, relatable character""? Gunshots right beside the MMCs (in the same room) with absolutely no effect on hearing? I mean I can ignore a lot of shit, but these seem so....blatant? Obvious? ""Wow 4 really scary guys are about to hurt me, but lets talk about how turned on I am getting looking at them even as they threaten to >!rape and murder!< me"" - tf? How are these realistic actions and thoughts? BIG oof. It's like it was written by a horny 15 year old masochist.
2. Everyone feels like a cardboard cut out with literally no personality whatsoever. The FMC is a bad bitch, we get it, but that's ALL she is. I don't see anything else from her. Shes...well, shes fucking boring. ""I get bitchy when I am hungry"", ""I get bitchy when I am upset"" - ...ok? Got anything else for me aside from the fact that you are bad to the bone and mean? We got that. The author just keeps hitting me over the head with a 2x4 and trying to drill it into me. SHES A BAD BITCH I GET IT! My god! I don't need to be spoon fed- I've got brain cells! Same with the dudes. All flat. no complexity. Even the names are just google searches for ""sexy man names""- Ryder Viper? REALLY?
3. What is with them having literally no remorse? I have read a decent amount of dark romance but I stumbled into this one and am just shocked by how they truly and genuinely have >!tortured, raped, and murdered!< people and just been like ""meh that's us!"". I get there will be an arc in here somewhere (well, actually, I am not sure), feelings will arise , blah blah blah that will make us like them but....that doesn't excuse just going ""oopsie you hurt all these people but you're hot, so teehee its ok!""

Maybe this was just a genre of dark romance where I put my foot down, but it was RAVED by so many on the reviews and is so popular that I REALLY was surprised at how atrociously it was written. 

Anywho that's just my opinion. No hate to anyone who loves it this dark- its all fantasies at the end of the day! None of it is real- and that is totally a-ok.

But yeah, not sure if this is just an actually shit book, or if I just stumbled too far down the rabbit hole. Should I try to push onwards? Does it really get better? Do tell.

Also: to bleach my eyeballs from this trash- top mafia books you absolutely fell for? I need something good after this!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/vv9xsp/dnfed_den_of_vipers_super_shocked_it_was_this_bad/,2022-07-09T20:06:35Z,117,231,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST

12yuaey,Miscommunication Trope: Why do you love/hate it?,"I just DNF a book that was going so well because the miscommunication within it was utterly frustrating! And then I stopped to wonder what about it was frustrating? Why do I hate this trope? For this book particularly it was a dual POV. I realized that I knew both sides and how they felt, but neither one could/would talk to the other and that got to me. They realized they cared for one another early on, but spent so much of the book in this trope that I couldn't take it anymore. I DNF at 66% which was such a bummer since it seemed promising.

I'm someone who needs to talk about a problem because if I don't, then I end up overthinking and questioning everything. I also think that since I've been in therapy (due to anxiety from overthinking) I see things a bit differently now. I don't want to go to bed next to my husband with doubts and confusing thoughts. I want to make sure we are both on the same page. I could definitely see this trope being less frustrating if it was from one POV,  too. Since it's more realistic to how we as readers view life. But when the author tells the readers what the MCs are thinking, tells us that the MCs *want* to communicate, and then makes them do everything *BUT* communicate. Like, whyyyy?

Looking at past post, I can see some people either absolutely love it or absolutely hate this trope. So, I want to know WHY do you love it or hate it? What about it frustrates you? Or why does this trope have  an absolute choke hold on you?

P.S. The book I DNF was Reject Me by Kel Carpenter & Aurelia Jane",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/12yuaey/miscommunication_trope_why_do_you_lovehate_it/,2023-04-25T20:03:07Z,73,47,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST
1b0cn04,Aubrey/Hannah/Dare from Even If It Hurts by Sam Mariano: Throuple or couple? ,"I just finished reading {Even if it hurts by Sam Mariano} and then went ahead and read the bonus contents from book 3 & 4 of the series which related to the same couple, and now I badly need to discuss with possible like-minded folks. This post is probably going to sound like stream of consciousness and not be super coherent. Sorry in advance. Loads of spoilers ahead.

I like dark romances a lot, and not much turns me off other than SA of the FMC by a non-MMC (borderline-SA/dubcon/noncon-with-orgasm by the actual MMC doesn't turn me off, which is super hypocritical of me probably, but there it is lol). Anyways, Dare-Aubrey's ""romance"" was pretty iffy to me from the beginning, what with him basically turning her into his paid mistress with zero agency, and her being totally okay with it. But then... THEN...came the weird chemistry between the MMC and FMC's bff, Hannah. At first I was like: maybe I'm overthinking, maybe I'm reading too much into it. But then the epilogue at the end of the book, plus the bonus contents with the other books really played it up a lot more, and now I'm really icked out and don't know how to feel about it. I've read a few posts, theories, & reviews related to this and honestly don't know how to feel. The MMC has a tattoo related to Hannah apparently? And they talk in this super flirty way (flirty for him, threatening for normal people lmao). He goes into Hannah's bedroom and threatens her in a sexual way too. If it weren't Dare and was some other guy, I would immediately think this is Hannah's MMC. Then Hannah lies awake at night thinking about him, and looking at Aubrey+Dare's photos together on social media make her jealous(?). And then the FMC also kind of has a lot of chemistry/feelings for Hannah, much more than a normal bff warrants. And the way Hannah and Aubrey think about each other is kinda lover-y too
Is this going to turn into a throuple situation? Honestly at this point I would probably be happy if Aubrey and Hannah really did kill the MMC and run away together or something, that would honestly feel better to me than Hannah and Dare getting together with Aubrey gone. 

I'm all on board with dark romances, obsessive MMCs with no boundaries etc. As long as the MMC *ONLY* obsesses about the FMC, not someone else. I have never before read a series (more like read the 1st book, skimmed the rest) where a couple is basically retconned later on. It kind of feels like I got duped, because Dare and Aubrey no longer feel like an endgame. So what was the point of his obsession and us discounting all the lines he crossed for the FMC and chalking it up to a villain MMC being his best self? If they ultimately break up or another person is introduced into the relationship, does it even feel like the same romance anymore? I have no issues with RH/poly books either, but I like them to be labelled as that from the very beginning so we can go in with open eyes. But Aubrey and Dare's story was originally written as a dark MF romance, but now with Hannah playing such a huge role in the bonus content, and the hints the author themselves are dropping, it's clear that Aubrey-Dare are not endgame. 

Anyone else in the same boat as me who feel kinda bamboozled by this series? I would love to hear your thoughts. This kinda put me in a funk because I was excusing so much of the MMC's bullshit thinking that they are the endgame, but now feel kinda sad at the sunk cost of reading the whole book at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1b0cn04/aubreyhannahdare_from_even_if_it_hurts_by_sam/,2024-02-26T08:30:02Z,40,11,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST
r82zhm,Don’t judge a book by its cover… AKA: Books you read this year that were NOT what you thought it was based on the title/cover/blurb?,"As we look back back on 2021, let’s consider the unexpected curveballs our book selections threw at us!

Mostly, I found that it was wannabe seasonal books tend to be ill-matched. 

In the spring, I wanted a fun read to flip through on the back porch swing with lemonade. Mary Kay Andrews’s *Spring Fever* seemed like it would fit the bill! It has a title that invokes images of picnics and vacations and a cover with three pairs of flip flops. Perfect, right? Wrong. While I enjoyed reading it, and it wasn’t bad, it was one of the most depressing slogs of a second chance romance I’ve ever read! Spoiler: >!Seriously, the most fun part of that book is that the MMC’s OW girlfriend is a stereotype straight out of *It Takes Two* or *The Parent Trap*.!<

In the summer, Nan Rossiter’s *The Gin and Chowder Club* seemed like it could be juicy and fun. It ended up being more women’s fiction than romance, but I was all, ‘whatever, I love to read anything and everything, and I’m always down to clown.’ I don’t mind when characters’ faith informs their world view and actions, but I wasn’t expecting to be proselytized to about Jesus as much as I was >!in a story about a college student having an affair with his dad’s best friend’s inappropriately young wife.!< I also didn’t expect random chapters to be so poorly written. 

The strangest and most incongruous choice, though, was the one I just finished, which inspired this post: Macomber’s *Jingle All the Way*. Despite the title, it is barely about Christmas (there are a few scenes shoved in at the end). It has a cover featuring a snowy sleigh in a scene as picturesque as any greeting card, and takes place in the *jungles of the Amazon, where the love story takes place on a river cruise*. 

(Did anyone read it? Because I have no idea what I just read — from the FMC being a bully and the not-like-the-other-girls bashing of the FMC’s assistant (hashtag justice for Annette; it’s not her fault she’s young, sheltered, and spoiled; she needs her own book; what a freakin’ legend) to the >!actually kind of 1950s-racist-cartoon-stereotype-but-at-least-it-turns-out-to-be-a-big-misunderstanding scene!< and the unexpected ending. Like, our serious executive FMC who loves living in the city and doesn’t have time to cook for herself >!lets her family of origin guilt her into moving back to her middle-of-nowhere hometown and ends up opening a candy store with her sister — who is a hairstylist — to sell candy based on their recipes from a dead relative who has been mentioned like three times total while the MMC gives up a naturalist job he loves in the Amazon to be with her, to teach at a university, and to live near his brother but ends up with her in her parents’ farm town!<? Like, what the actual eff did I just read? I mean, I read it in a single sitting, but like… *what*. Are all Macomber books like this, you guys?)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/r82zhm/dont_judge_a_book_by_its_cover_aka_books_you_read/,2021-12-03T16:29:43Z,36,21,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST

o37p2q,"The People We Meet On Vacation by Emily Henry reminded me what it felt like to fall in love with my husband. The banter, the giddy rush of excitement, the pangs of uncertainty and longing - GAHHH this book - it speaks to me!","This is my 66th romance novel this year and I haven't written a single review, but I absolutely have to gush and gush *and gush* about this book. I happy cried. **IT. WAS. BREATHTAKING.**

**TL;DR** Emily Henry, take all of my money forever. I will read anything you write. PLEASE. MORE.

You know that feeling of belonging that makes your heart constrict with happiness when you’re a part of an inside joke? How *special* it feels to be included, particularly if you've been excluded before and know how shitty it feels? *That*, my romance lovin' friends, is what reading this freaking book felt like. I was included in not one but **MANY** excellent inside jokes. With past and present timelines, Emily Henry gives you the jokes' origin stories *and then* does call back after hilarious call back in the most subtle way. It’s something I didn’t even realize I needed until now. 

**(FMC)** Poppy is my favorite kind of heroine. FUNNY and often lacking in filter. Unapologetically herself.

**(MMC)** Alex is a kind Beta hero. I LOVE KIND HEROS! He's hilarious and secretly weird, but only lets Poppy see his weird *(fans self).* He’s attractive without being vain and is adorably unaware of the effect he has on women. 

**Only a little steamy** (similar level to Beach Read).

**Tropes:** >!Slow burn, Friends to lovers, Forced proximity/only one bed, and my personal favorite: the even more spoilery “he’s been in love with her the whole time” trope. OH and it has dual timelines like the second chance romance trope though I wouldn’t really classify it as one.!<

So often when I’m reading romance it seems like the author gives the characters just enough personality to make them believable while still being vague enough for the characters to be considered attractive to as many readers as possible. This book though, you guys, *these* characters feel *real* to me. They're unique. If you were to tell me that this book is based on a true story I would 100% believe you. I *want* to believe you. 



**Things that make this book so special: (definitely probably contains more spoilers than tags)**

* How quick witted and fun their banter is.
* Trip descriptions good enough to make any travel writer proud.

* The body positive comments from her mom that make me want to do this for my children someday: >!”Vanity is something he was raised to avoid. Whereas my mom used to write little notes on my bathroom mirror in dry-erase marker: Good morning to that beautiful smile. Hello, strong arms and legs. Have a great day, lovely belly that feeds my darling daughter. Sometimes I still hear those words when I get out of the shower and stand in front of the mirror, combing my hair: Good morning, beautiful smile. Hello, strong arms and legs. Have a great day, lovely belly that feeds me.”!<

* Poppy’s reasons for loving The Bachelor.

* The games they make up together.

* *What in Sam Hill was Buck saying on that GD water taxi, amirite?*

* **Have I mentioned that I love a good call back???**

* How much Poppy loves her family and struggles internally not to be embarrassed by them. 

* How much the main characters click despite how different they are. 

* They both go to therapy (*hellooooo* self-awareness and character development).

* *“Naked Alex”*

* Alex’s sensitivity to Poppy’s teasing. Emily Henry really caught me with the feels when >!Poppy realizes that Alex has stopping doing certain things in front of her for fear that she’ll make fun of him.!< It’s such a real aspect of any long lasting relationship, and I love how Poppy learns to think before she speaks more often as she grows up.

* Alex confessing that >!he remembers everything (all their little inside jokes she thought he had forgotten).!<

* I LOVED hearing what Alex was thinking and feeling. The angst when >!Poppy confronts Alex about having bought an engagement ring for Sarah and he tells her how much her pregnancy scare effected him and how EVERYTHING is because of her.!<

Now, I’m not just saying this because I grew up near those giant Cabazon dinosaurs or because I first started to fall for my husband in a grove of giant redwoods or because he makes this exact joke >!“When our server left us with our menus, Alex did that old-man thing, where he opened it and reared back from the prices with widening eyes, like a startled horse.”!< and I find it hilarious EVERY TIME, **BUT, I feel like this book was written just for me. Or, you know, for Poppy and Alex who are definitely real human beings who exist on earth.**

And while I did think the conflict >!in Croatia was a bit anticlimactic and not a good enough reason to let a friendship that important fade away!< I did feel that Poppy needed those two years to focus on her career and realize she wasn't happy. Long distance friendships *are* really challenging. I felt the ending more than made up for it.

Damn this magical book. . . so relatable. It just freaking *speaks* to me, you know?

**Editing to add anecdotal update:**  After posting this I told my husband that I mentioned him in this post and he asked if he could see what I wrote. *Weeeellllll*, I’ve since been properly admonished (mostly joking) about how I probably shouldn’t use terms like “alpha and beta” because **toxic masculinity**. Which, okay, he’s totally right about. BUT it’s also how we talk about characters on this sub and referring to them in their simplest form helps us find the kinds of books we are actually looking for, right? Anyway, I responded with some equally classy version of, ”You don’t even go here!” (here obviously being this sub) in true Mean Girls fashion. However, I’m not changing it because *apparently* I’ve found the metaphorical hill I’m willing to die on. **He also insists that he is, and I quote, “Waaaay funnier than that Alex guy.”** I then asked if he was dying to print out my post so he could copy edit it with a red pen (another way my husband is eerily similar to Alex). *le sigh* marital bliss, amirite? 🤣🤣🤣",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/o37p2q/the_people_we_meet_on_vacation_by_emily_henry/,2021-06-19T04:02:36Z,59,396,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST

wrpv3m,"Broken French by Natasha Boyd: I'm not sure if the French is Broken, but after reading it surely my brain is","This post will contain spoilers about Broken French by Natasha Boyd, so if you haven't read it yet and plan to, skip this and be happy!

I've finished the book three hours ago give or take and I can't shake the awful feelings it gave me.
I'll try to keep it short! 

My thoughts are all jumbled so I'll give them to you in a very chaotic way, sorry 😅

- Stereotypes. For the love of God, it's 2022, there is a growing awareness about the importance of being understanding and respectful about other people lives and costumes and the author couldn't even be bothered to research the setting she wanted to set the book on.
I'm not French, I admit that I'm not an expert about French ways of living (even if I live fairly close), but I know a thing or two that could be adjusted in the book. 
No, in Europe the beaches aren't primarily nudist, no, not all the French women go topless to the beach and also no, at the market it's not common being touched by a stranger salesperson that want to take your measurements (here the fmc had a very peculiar experience were even her boobs were manhandled by a stranger that didn't even ask if it was ok to touch to begin with, but hey, the mmc said it happened to him to so no problem, it's normal). On this side of the planet we aren't savages who touch everything and everyone without second thoughts. 
Also, I know it's me, but: ""Did little French ladies stand in front of their pale blue doors and sweep their stone steps and shoo the stray cats? Did they all walk home with fresh baguettes every day?"" 
Why... Why would you even think they would do that. It's so stereotyped it hurts and I have to say, if you know so little about the place you want to describe that you have to relay on stereotype so heavily to create the ambience, well... Something is definitely very wrong. 
I understand that it's a different country and can be difficult to picture, but it's not an excuse anymore with internet and all that that can provide a normal view of the real life here. 
I also understand that the point of these descriptions was to maintain the aura of romanticism that surrounds everything that is French, but I guess I reacted a bit too strongly because the fmc wasn't exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, so since I didn't like her I tended to take her every thought/move in the wrong way. Also, she apparently was totally in love with France even before accepting the job, so her nonsensical view of what to expect in the country makes even less sense because she should know that little French ladies don't go around with baguettes under their arms. 

- The frog comment made by the fmc's friend, about going with the mmc to have little frogs (children) together. Being the mmc French, well... I'll leave this here without further comments, because I don't think it needs any. 

- The Italian restaurant owner in Corsica named... Cristo. So. I can assure you that the number of Italian people named Cristo is very close to a very round shaped zero. Because Cristo means Christ, we don't give this kind of name, even Gesù (Jesus) it's very very rare and if anything only very old people have it. I have to assume she made some researches to find it... Just not the right ones. Again. 
I won't even start on (again) the stereotypical description of the other Italian character, when I read she completed the look with a golden chain I wanted to email the author to ask her why she didn't also make him lazily strum a mandolin. 

- This is actually a question for French speaking people: the books it's full of French sentences (BECAUSE OF COURSE) but my French is very limited so I don't know if it's written right or not. I've read a review that says that it's not very accurate, with bad grammar and such. I get very irked when bad Italian is used with the quick translation of google translate, so I wanted to know if this was the case. 

- This is something that bothered me a lot, but it's difficult to put into words. 
Like I've said, I'm not American, I'm Italian (now you get the Cristo perplexity up there lol). 
So, sometimes in the book the fmc would say some things like 'why couldn't America do this thing good too?' or 'we (in America) think we know how to make this but we do not', and such, maybe talking about food, like make good bread.
Now, I understand the desire to show how much you appreciate the food of that country, clearly the intent is good, but why the hell sell yourself short in the process? Yeah, they make a good salami. Why also throw in there that in America salami is plain salami? Every country has its strong points, no need to discredit one to elevate the other, its not right and it doesn't make sense (for example, I told this bit to my mother, she was raised in America and lived there for a very long time. In particular she was kind of offended about the bread remark because she told me that some of the yummiest bread she has ever eaten was the one her step father bought there sometimes).
I like Italian Kinder Pinguì and I like American Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, I don't need to say that Italian sweets are crap to convey how much I appreciate the American ones!

- The whole romance. Let me get this straight, he is basically a hormonal teenager for most of the books and near the end (80%~) shifts into shitface jerk mode, rejects and insults the fmc, accusing her of being involved with the abduction of her daughter, is incapable of telling her 'I'm sorry' like an adult, tells her that she is only meaningless sex, treats her like shit... And she still fall for him, sometimes she even says I'M SORRY. For what?! For making me read what comes out of your mouth, I hope. After he told her some crap things, she goes and hugs him. She forgives his hateful words and actions telling herself that, eh, he was panicking because her daughter was abducted, it's understandable. Even his nice little outburst of rage against the seat in the helicopter was just wonderful, but again, oh, the poor baby was stressed.

*Ehy, lady, wait, you've dropped your dignity here, let me pick it up for you.*

Because being stressed it's not an excuse, you can snap under stress, maybe say something out of line, but you don't accuse someone to have abducted your child. At the end of the book the mmc was being mean without a reason, he was just angry about the whole situation and taking it out on the fmc. 
She is a doormat, he is a moron. I won't even start on the whole drama of him at 35 yo having the emotional stability of a spoon and being unable to control his dick enough to respect an employee. He decided to fire her, because she was too hot. Then not to fire her, because she was too hot. Yeah, no, he fired her because she was too hot and now they could go at it. 
Everything was all just lust from ths beginning, not the grand romance they played it out to be in the end.
This brings us to the next point:

- When exactly did they fall in love? Did I miss something? Because from what I remember there was lust... Lust... More lust... Two meaningful conversations in the whole book ending with him being mean... Luuuuust... Hate, because it's the famous third act drama and misunderstanding routine, right?... Then BAM MERRY ME BECAUSE I LOVE YOU THE END also I've accused you three weeks ago of abducting my child because clearly I don't trust you for shit, but let's not dwell on the past, I've bought that nice hotel for you to play architect, right? (also, sorry, I've seen a lot of love for Dauphine, but the last scene with the note and the 'please be my step mom' after only two months at best - with the child having night terrors still because she was traumatized about the loss of her real mom - was so unrealistic I've cringed like crazy, my molars were on the brink of breaking). 
Clearly I've missed something.

I'm sure there are other things that bothered me, but right now my brain is at its limit. 

I'm sorry, but I needed to vent a bit. Probably the problem was that I went in with a lot of expectations, hoping this might be my next favorite or close favorite book (having loved her All That Jazz book I had high hopes). Clearly it wasn't by a long shot and fell of the expectations tree right on my ass- *cul*, sorry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/wrpv3m/broken_french_by_natasha_boyd_im_not_sure_if_the/,2022-08-18T17:45:05Z,21,31,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST
s5c6mi,Why is it so hard to find a book with a normal male pov? And don't yall feel like the Romance/ YA / New Adult books have the same cliche/ trope over and over again? (also pls recommend some male pov books),"At this point I've grown so tired of romance novels, i feel i could sell them all off for money and get myself some pizza and chicken. It's like the same fanfiction  written over and over again in diff formats and with diff characters.

it's like the same cycle everywhere. Every romance writer has one trope:-

1) a girl who's not up to the mark or doesn't match the social standards (or she wears glasses and she's unaware of her actually being a prime model of those social norms), catches the eye of the popular guy or a guy with amazingly good looks who happens to be extremely rich or a part of a sports team

2) girl has a ""not rare but nerdy"" hobby which is generally associated to guys alone makes the guy fetish over her secretly. Guy has a rare hobby (that oddly coincides with the girls hobby) despite his good looks thus making him mysterious -(some of these books make it seem like only hot guys have  supposed rare hobbies and the average looking men aren't mysterious enough)

3) The gods enjoying their heavily loaded pizzas are busy trying to put their relationship to a major test in which you can never score an a+ unless you're the protagonist and the love interest (the major exceptions).

4) They overcome the hurdles together and pass the test with an A++ making their imaginary asian mom real proud (no. this isn't the test that gets the protagonist into the ivy league - none of the stories -that is if it's taking place in the us mentions anything abt SAT, ACT or shows the girl prepping for it but she ends up with a 4.0 gpa because she's einstein's granddaughter).

4)  the girl gets an admission in an ivy league school or a reputed college or her business picks up -

5) the distance and stress puts their relationship through another test ( they just need therapy at this point). The guy doesn't cheat nor the girl. They still bring each other flowers everyday and get intimate.

6) of course since conquering tests are one of their many superpowers including summoning money out of nowhere to buy fancy clothes to lure her bf or to make him jealous while she's grinding on someone else which is totally ok cause it just makes him want her more. If that was me - she's going down the drain and imma seal the drain so that she doesn't escape. OR, the guy kisses another girl to make her jealous. (Dump that bish - move on. But that girl won't do that , cause its unrealistic according to the romance writers out there.)

bf gets into a fight. tells her ""the only person who can ever lay their hands on this precious piece of art is me and me only. "" gf blushes . one intimate night and all the problems are solved.

another plot twist- girls best friend has a secret crush on him and drunk bf gets going with girls bf.

Girl's sad. She leaves the house they moved into only after two months of meeting and decides she's doomed for life. Drunk bf comes banging on her door one day, gives her a philosophical speech about wat love is- offering her a pickup line cheesier than joshua weissman's cheese sandwich and she thinks that they're the definition of love.

8) next- either one of them dies because of cancer/ car accident- bf /gf finds secret diary abt how much they loved each other  or  they get married - happily ever after and the same story continues onto the next books- since their offsprings have the same dna as themselves the same story is bound to repeat. They have no priorities except love for her insanely hot bf. 

It's so hard to find a good book these days. And honestly speaking, most of the books are from the female pov and if there is a male pov it's about him gushing over how hot the female protagonist is and nun abt his personal life- like does he like pizza? does he like to crawl on walls? eat paint? go dancing with gorillas? do they hug themselves when they feel lonely? is he secretly in love with a guy and a girl? Is he a young single dad? Does he love archaic art and literature? Does he appreciate renaissance architecture? Does he wish Gordon Ramsey was his dad? Does he hate working out?  Nothing. Nothing new. 

All books make their protagonists so perfect. Just one flaw isn't going to make a person vulnerable. And that one flaw is probably a terminal illness or that he used to bully the female protagonist.

I want a male pov book where the male protagonist is the first one to fall in love. The male protagonist actually puts in effort to make the relationship work rather than his female counterpart clinging onto him just because he looks good.

I want a male protagonist who doesn't  always end up being a billionaire or a famous writer or singer. I want a male protagonist to date someone normal like him (like no fancy shi- no rich girl, no singer , no princess etc) (i mean a commoner (guy/girl/ human) falling in love with a princess wud be nice ... haven't seen a lot of these..) .  i want a pair of lovers who don't want to get married or have kids. i want a possible trouple maybe (i mean im not the type who'd get into that kind of a relationship but i still respect that idea and i guess it'd be fun and diff to read). I want the bf to have some uncommon insecurities. Something realistic (of course this is not applicable to the fantasy genre).

a male protagonist who doesn't look like an abercombie and fitch model , doesn't always walk arounf shirtless, whose tummy doesn't have abs but still finds love. Who tf told em writers that guys who don't have abs and have green/blue/purple eyes can't find love?!

And if there are any books out there that pertain to the above , Pls recommend! I'd love to fill my dog's ears with something new!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/s5c6mi/why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_a_book_with_a_normal/,2022-01-16T13:45:30Z,26,9,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST
sad94y,How different is the print special edition of Ice Planet Barbarians? Is it less triggering? I bought it and can now give a conclusive answer,"Ruby Dixon recently released a [special edition of Ice Planet Barbarians](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593546024/ref=cm_sw_r_awdo_navT_a_XGBVCWYHQVEECGDDQV2K) that is slightly different from the kindle and audible versions. But what exactly is different?

First, there is new content — a 28 page epilogue. Most of the additional length is added by Ice Planet Honeymoon being included at the end.

I’ve seen a lot of people discussing the print edition of Ice Planet Barbarians as “less triggering because of editing.” This is why I bought the physical book — I loved the series but hated how dark the first chapter was. There are differences, but it’s very close to the original.

**I do NOT recommend buying the special edition if you’re specifically looking for the less dark version. In my opinion, you’re better off picking whichever format you like and skipping to the scene break line on page 19 or 21, depending on the edition you’re reading.** From that point on, it’s MUCH less dark. There are still some dark and triggering moments in the series, but the imminent threat and fear is pretty much over. **You can skip those pages and miss out on very little plot or character information, and it feels like a logical place to start a story.** 

If you like paper books, the new cover is absolutely gorgeous — but you could see that from the Amazon page!

##I’ll talk about specific parts of the book below, and cover what is different between the editions. From this point on, there will be spoilers. You’ve been warned!

As I said before: my conclusion is it’s different but not any less triggering to someone who doesn’t want to read about rape. 

-	The scene in chapter 1 where minor character Dominique is raped has “…” in place of the original sequence. From what i can tell, the cutting of some text here is the only change in this sequence. But IMO, it doesn’t really help because of all the stuff that remains. For example:
-	In the next paragraph, she’s described as being “attacked” which is intentionally vague. The subtext implies she was raped or beaten—there’s references to the aliens “touching her“ while she screams. 
-	A few pages later, Georgie says she’s “seen another girl raped over the past week because she cried out in a nightmare” which tells us she’s seen rape before. And the reason they’re too afraid to scream is because the aliens will rape them. 
-	The word rape is used a lot in general and are other words that imply that — like that Dominique was “brutalized” or Georgie’s fear of the aliens “touching her”
-	the aliens give “leering grins” to the girls and they’re terrified of them
-	they all are terrified that they’ll either be raped or eaten if they don’t escape. They talk about this and reference fear of getting raped multiple times
-	When they’re planning a rebellion, Liz says it’ll just result in them getting raped, and everyone’s reaction implies they have seen this happen and know it’s a distinct possibility
-	in both editions, it is casually mentioned that a character who was 2 months pregnant was forcibly given an abortion

**All of that happens before my recommended start point on page 19/21.** From what I can tell everything after that is pretty much the same. 

Just to cover the remaining potential triggers present in both:

-	The first sex scene is still the same word for word—just as much questionable consent as before. If you haven’t read it, there’s some fated mates stuff and cultural differences… so he thinks going down on her while she’s still asleep is ok? It’s kinda weird because rather than freaking out, she enjoys it. So it didn’t bug me because she wasn’t upset. But I can see it being a potential trigger for some. I didn’t check much after that, but the length matches up closely

So yeah. The editing is very minor. The threat and implication of rape is 100% still there, and the removal of the on-page rape doesn’t do a whole lot to make this feel less dark. I recommend this edition for fans who want to add a book with a pretty cover to their shelves or want the new epilogue, but not for those of us who could be triggered by the first chapter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/sad94y/how_different_is_the_print_special_edition_of_ice/,2022-01-22T21:58:46Z,12,31,RomanceBooks,It Ends with Us,POST

1526fqs,I don't get the hype for 'It Ends With Us',"This is a rant, feel free to agree or disagree.

I bought it blind because I heard some people recommend it as a book about family/generational trauma and abuse. I have a complicated family history and am in the middle of breaking the cycle, so the title and recommendations lured me in, but oh. My. gOD this book was triggering. It genuinely made me angry, especially whilst reading the author's note at the end, I couldn't get through it. 

I mean, the author herself wrote she ""fell in love"" with the abusive character she wrote. It felt weirdly fetishistic about abuse/toxic relationships and it rubbed me the wrong way all throughout.

Like, sure, she remembers seeing her father throw a TV at her mother at age 3. However, I don't think she actually understands the intricacies and realities of what it's like to be in the shoes of someone who grew up being repeatedly exposed to intense abuse like her main character did. 

Also, I happened to stumble upon some fan content of the book online and I was aghast by the people saying they'd still pick Ryle, like???? That's the opposite effect you'd want if you wrote a book about this subject with good intentions instead of sensationalising it for impressionable readers that are already prone to getting into toxic relationships 😭",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1526fqs/i_dont_get_the_hype_for_it_ends_with_us/,2023-07-17T16:18:30Z,73,138,books,It Ends with Us,POST

t0m0h1,It Ends with Us is trash. I was swindled by Tiktok. Tell me otherwise. I dare you.,"So last month I finished It Ends with Us by Colleen Hoover, and let me tell you I did NOT expect to dislike it to the extent that I do. I did not also expect to feel scammed by Tiktok over this highly popular book which so many people- to this day- make constant posts about how it's their favorite book.

It wasn't just Tiktok, it was constantly on every platform that could ever recommend a book. It was on reddit, Instagram, Youtube, GoodReads and so much that you actually want to give it chance, cuz you think, ""that many people can't be wrong, can they?"" And hell, they were. I just don't get it.

This is ofc a rant on the whole book and how I felt afterwards, its only my take on it and I know that it could be your fav book I'm trashing, but then again I'm only going to respect your opinion. And in end, if it gets too heated, let's just agree to disagree. So here it goes:

&#x200B;

Rating- 1 star(with extra generosity, and only for Atlas)

&#x200B;

LOVE-

\- Atlas of course, his story and his kind and considerate actions.

&#x200B;

EH?

\- >!condescending main girl, even though writer tries to show she's not (no don't tell me she wasn't, every time she described Atlas in the beginning, she constantly called him ""homeless"". Sometimes even when things are obvious, you just don't verbalize it, words like that can be ugly and as a reader I only felt that this girl was looking down on him. Was it really necessary to call him that that many times? really?)!<

>!\- TELL TELL TELL TELL TELL TELL writing.!<

>!\- characters who spend literally no time bonding (except atlas and lily), and the only ""bonding"" scenes is mating??? Not only with Ryle and Lily, but also Lily and Alyssa. Lily meets Alyssa in the afternoon, and by evening they're BBFs? Totally possible. Yes!<

>!\- Chances that Alyssa is Ryle's sister? Every single one. Yes, totally possible again. (cringing so hard my face might contort)!<

>!\- Ryle? A big fat mistake to walk on the face of the earth. Honestly, no it's actually Lily. Lily's a big fat mistake.!<

>!\- Girl doesn't think twice before marrying some random dude she met 6 months ago, after the possible risk that he might turn out like her father? WTF was she thinking? Oh right, she wasn't. She just doesn't think.!<

>!\- Dude is a huge red flag in itself cuz he doesn't care abt relationships, and all he wants is to bang and leave (Do you guys see a toxic pattern here in CH's books? Does this remind of another book/2 maybe? Let me help you- Ugly Love and stupid Verity(it's the girl here tho)). !<

>!\- How could she like him???  How???! Oh cuz he's good in bed, right. Or ""oh his voice hits me right in my stomach"". Totally. Girls aren't so gullible like CH makes her FMCs out to be , which is such a big hypocrite factor for me cuz if she's writing a book about women empowerment, she truly needed to up her game rather than write things that make girls seem like they're nothing more than superficial aff.                            ???!<

>!\- Oh, here's the fun part tho, he changes. For her. Yes another fucking totally! (I'd rather be run over by cows with shit all over their feet than read this book)!<

>!\- Most of the time it felt like the things that the characters did didn't feel much like what they would actually do, but rather what the writer is making them do. The fact that it feels this way is a clear sign that the writer has derailed from the story.!<

>!\- Lily doesn't want to make a decision on their marriage until the baby comes out because of what!!!??? Pregnancy hormones? So all pregnant women are incapable of making decisions at all then??? And then immediately, the moment the baby comes out she decides for a divorce??? The fucking second she sees him hold their daughter? No preg hormones then huh? Yes, of course. What CH writes is what actually is. Yes.!<

>!\- Terrible writing. Terrible characters. Very distracting plot holes.!<

>!\- What's up with Allysa? She was soooo purposefully made that way, the cliché friend, so common it hurts. She naturally just sees the sign and comes to work for Lily? Cuz she's too bored of being rich? Where does this even happen?!<

>!\- Lily hires Allysa without a second thought. No background asked, no serial killer check, no nothing. ""Just gonna work for free??? Okay cool. You can start right away. Oh l kinda feel guilty for making you work for free though, so $10/hour? Sure. Of course.""!<

>!\- WHAT THE FUCK WERE THOSE JOURNALSSS??? EWWWW. Could she have come up with anything worse than those to convey the story? Guess we'll never know. After reading the book, I fully realize the sole purpose of the journals was so that Ryle would find them, and do what he will so that the story can progress. Terrible. While I was reading, it would've made so much more of an impact if the writer chose to maybe give Lily flashbacks of her time, dreams every single day, like she was always constantly traumatized by what happened to atlas. She then visits maybe a therapist to take help from, and he says journaling might help, and then ryle find those papers. Or ryle just goes through her files from the doc. Can't make him more of a dick than he already is, so why not?!<

>!\- People don't just get over that trauma of being in an abusive household like how CH made it look like- it haunts them for the rest of their life. When someone places something a little to hard on the ground, when someone shouts, when someone's quiet, when someone's being a little too rough with them even when they're clearly joking, they're constantly reminded, they constantly wonder if that someone is angry. Where was this??? WHERE??? Terrible writing.!<

>!\- Lily was a pain. So very frustrating. She blamed atlas for not coming back for her, while she dated the first guy she met. The guy who clearly had a temper. No, I'm not saying she should've known before, but I'm saying the obvious reaction should've been doubting men because of her childhood, I've known people who are extremely cautious of the same because of going through something similar. I know not everyone is the same, but that reaction should be blatant. How could she even find him attractive? How is she not reminded of her father all the fucking time??? How does she not take caution before dating another man??? !<

>!\- She met him on a rooftop, he flirts, and she falls in love with him?   ?   ?   ?   ? It makes more sense if they just hooked up than get married because of that, because that's all he wanted anyway.!<

>!\- Repeated disappointing behavior. When he did what he did the second time, it should've been over there. I don't care how much she loved him, or how much of their future she saw(which the author didn't mention one bit of, 0% explanation of show writing and 10000% of just telling-""oh she loved him, so if you disapprove, you're standing on the outside, you don't understand"". NO. Just NO.)she should have walked away without another word. But no. Even when he says he blacks out because of what he did to his brother, she only should've felt sorry for him and nothing more, but she takes that as a valid justification on his behalf for what he did. This is why girls like Inej and stories like Six of Crows are legendary-""He's gonna fix himself, and I'm gonna fix myself"". Not one person doing the fixing for both of them. Fuck this!!<

>!\- I never expected a character to be perfect. I in fact like stories that display the contrary, like if I were reading about a morally gray character, I'd like him to find redemption at some point, if I were reading about a character who never made mistakes, maybe he'd make a grave one along the way in the book, something to say that things can always go against us and we'd make poor choices. I get that. But what I truly don't get in IEWU is the ""repetitiveness"" of the same bad choices, up to the point where it gets so frustrating to sit with. He (literally) bites her neck of, punches her, pushes her down an entire flight of stairs, and each time she forgives him. She's covered in bruises all the time, but he says he loves her though, so she forgives him again. What does that say to the women going through the same kind of thing? That's it's okay to be let yourself be treated that way? For what? !<

>!Plus the entire dislike of this book doesn't only revolve only the abusive part, it's also the unrealistic writing, the relationship of the FMC with others. The time jumps, as well as how she never apologized to the right people. Had a Atlas and Lily's position be changed, and atlas the reason lily gets beaten by his father, do you think readers would be okay to see atlas go on w never once apologizing? why double standards people?!<

>!\- Randomly just meets Altas one day, and decided to finally be together out of nowhere? Where's the angst? Where are the proper confrontations? Where is the fucking apology for what her father did to him??? WHEREEE??? TERRRIBBLLEEEE!!!!<

>!\- Pacing? No Jumping. SUCKSSS. Terrible writing.!<

>!\- I get that the book tried to be more on the educative side rather than entertaining, so its totally fine with the themes that play around. I'm never gonna say something was too difficult read (except ofc unrealistic trauma like A Little Life, but that's a story for another day) But where  is the realism when trying to convey that? Where is the strong, brave female lead who walks away at the right time? Where is the female lead who inspires other girls with her story, where she makes an example of herself and NOT someone who people can relate to, cuz sometimes what we need is someone who we can look up to and NOT someone who's on the same level and feel sorry for them because we fully understand what they're feeling. She's not his babysitter. She's not here to make him behave his best. ""He's going to pull himself together, and she's going stay by his side while he does that, not literally do it for him, and forgive him time and time again when he can't because then he's going blame her for not doing her job of pulling him together. Where's the female lead who never once looks back after something so cursed takes place, never even thinks that there's a possibility that more chances could be given? Because some things once said and done, there's NO going back. NEVER. Where is she? WHEREEE? Terrible.!<

\- Lacking in every way.

\- 0 aestheticism.

\- 0 introspective paragraphs, 0 memories or possibilities shared to the reader by the character, 0 contemplation before making any decision.

\- 0 everything.

If someone ever told me this book was sad, that would be the one most confusing statement I would ever hear because nothing about this book was sad, I would not shed air for this book, it was trash writing, and ever trashier characters (NOT Atlas). That was all it was.

Overall, TRASH.

153p4jz,'It Ends With Us': Hype vs. Reality,"So, I finally got around to reading 'It Ends With Us,' and to be honest, I can't quite grasp all the hype surrounding it. I mean, sure, it touches on some essential topics like abuse, but other than that, I didn't find anything particularly outstanding about the book. It felt like the whole plot was just too predictable, and everything played out exactly as I expected. No surprises whatsoever. The story was a bit too clichéd for my taste.

On the bright side, I have to admit the writing style was quite easy to follow, and I ended up finishing the entire book in just two days. However, I couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed by all the buzz TikTok created around what, in my opinion, turned out to be an average read. Also, I have to mention that all the explicit sexual content in the book felt so out of place for me, and perhaps it was because it was written from a girl's point of view, and I, being a guy, couldn't connect with it at all. I ended up skipping those pages altogether.

Amidst all this, there was this one scene that genuinely made me feel sad, and surprisingly, it wasn't even about Lily but her mother. On a positive note, Atlas was the one character I truly appreciated in the book. But overall, this experience has left me a bit hesitant about picking up another CoHo book in the future. I have a feeling that Wattpad stories might offer a better experience than this book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/153p4jz/it_ends_with_us_hype_vs_reality/,2023-07-19T08:35:46Z,31,24,books,It Ends with Us,POST
13762px,“It ends with us” by Colleen Hoover changed my life,"I finally got around to reading it, held off on it because I’ve heard all the negative reviews and was worried I would be triggered given the situation I found myself in with my last partner (hence the burner account), so I was weary. That said, after finishing it a few days ago I finally felt empowered enough to stand up to my abuser and leave for good. I realize it’s a fictional novel, but it opened my eyes to the fact that they are never going to change, they know exactly what they did and they will do it again, in a way that no one around me could do (despite their relentless efforts to get me away from them). I related to Lily Bloom’s circumstances on a number of levels, at times it felt like her internal monologue was taken right from my brain and placed right there in the book. While I recognize the significance of the controversy surrounding the book, and I empathize with those who stand against it, it truly changed my life for the better. I am finally free, thank you Colleen Hoover.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13762px/it_ends_with_us_by_colleen_hoover_changed_my_life/,2023-05-04T01:37:19Z,18,323,books,It Ends with Us,POST
18i3ebc,It Ends With Us - A Story that Will Stay with Me Forever,"I haven't read much of Colleen Hoover's work, and I always thought her novels were more towards teenagers. But ""It Ends With Us""  is a story that I know will stay with me forever._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Hoover's portrayal of the cycle of abuse was incredibly powerful. She didn't kept away from the harsh realities of domestic violence, but instead, she presented them in a way that was both raw and honest. I felt Lily's pain and confusion as she struggled to break free from the cycle._x000D_

As someone who grew up in a family where my mother was in an abusive relationship, I could see myself reflected in Lily's story. The fear, the guilt, the hope for a better life - I've felt them all._x000D_

But what truly resonated with me was Lily's strength. Despite everything she endured, she never gave up on herself. She finally found the courage to leave her husband and build a new life for herself._x000D_

And how can I forget to mention my most favorite words of the novel:  


""Cycles exist because they are excruciating to break. It takes an astronomical amount of pain and courage to disrupt a familiar pattern. Sometimes it seems easier to just keep running in the same familiar circles, rather than facing the fear of jumping and possibly not landing on your feet._x000D_

v5mgl5,Just finished It Ends With Us! (Colleen Hoover),"**IT ENDS WITH US -** I saw a lot of hype for this but I didn't read it for a while cause my friend would live update me when she was reading it. But, I read it a few days ago and here are my thoughts. I loved how Colleen made us look at all of the beautiful sides of Ryle first and made us fall in love with him cause it really put us in Lily's shoes. I personally loved how they flirted- 

He said once that ""There is no *bad* people"" and that ""no one is exclusively bad"" which to some extent is true but some ""good"" and personal reasons for those that commit bad, are not enough to justify the things they do. From that scene, I also saw that Ryle can be sympathetic to others which kind of built the idea in his character that he's not *him* when he's angry. 

I found Atlas quite irrelevant actually, he didn't really play a significant role on why Lily chose to leave Ryle. But, their love story was actually super romantic cause they never really got rid of their dent in each other's hearts. I'm just happy that Atlas was there to be of comfort to Lily, especially the ""keep swimming"" quote. I loved that detail in the epilogue too . Finally, Lily found someone she could set anchor in. 

I have so much appreciation for Lily. She is so strong for finding herself, her duty as a mother, and as a woman to no longer accept such pain from an abuser. It was actually a really great book that made you understand or at least give a slight idea on the different sides of domestic violence. I didn't cry until the last scene and epilogue to be honest, but a good read nonetheless!

What were your thoughts when you read IEWU?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v5mgl5/just_finished_it_ends_with_us_colleen_hoover/,2022-06-05T20:59:10Z,32,46,books,It Ends with Us,POST
vsy09t,It Ends With Us - It sucks,"really want to know what other people think of this book and Colleen Hoover in general. 

besides the questionable (!) writing style, I don't think Hoover's represented domestic abuse in the most sophisticated way. I mean her writer's note at the end talking about her mother's experiences had more impact than the book itself.

I really just don't appreciate the glamorisation of the abuser (Ryle) whose behaviour is excused by Alyssa as part of trauma without any regard how it may affect other people. Even after Lily's abuse, Alyssa still justifies it with his trauma and 'just how it is'. And then romanticising the whole thing with a past lover who basically rescues her. Everyone is rich, hot and white with virtually zero problems (bar the DA).

There is very little complexity of DA discussed: financial hardship/abuse, discussion about substance abuse, blurred lines in what constitutes abuse between Alyssa and Lily, for example. What about custody dispute for the child? Repercussions for Ryle's behaviour? The list goes on. 

I feel like her approach to raising awareness about DA and how difficult it is was just blindsided by the sheer glamorisation and the ungrounded narrative. If the focus was more so on the consequences, it would be a little more credible. 

What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vsy09t/it_ends_with_us_it_sucks/,2022-07-06T19:17:46Z,17,66,books,It Ends with Us,POST

q1b3hc,Colleen Hoover - It Ends With Us,"My first Colleen Hoover book was **Verity** and I should not have started with that one. When I read that book, I was so up and down with emotions and suspense and it set me up to believe that the majority of Colleen's books would be like that.

When I read **It Ends With Us**, though I enjoyed the story, I was disappointed in the lack of suspense/tension. Yes, there were points of the story that me all ""oh wow"" but nothing like Verity did when I read that.

It Ends With Us was a nice story to read and I liked the ending. However, I felt the relationship (though violent) with her and Ryle was anti-climactic. I also didn't like how the relationship with Atlas ended. And what was the point of the letters to Ellen if nothing ever came out of it? Was it just a different way to do flashbacks to Lily's past? Part of me was hoping they would have been sent to Ellen and something would have happened between Ellen and Lily. Just felt a bit random to me.

All in all, I liked the story. Just was disappointed on a few points throughout. 

Next on the list is **November 9**. We'll see if that one is a 5-star read for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q1b3hc/colleen_hoover_it_ends_with_us/,2021-10-04T18:05:19Z,31,21,books,It Ends with Us,POST
z3w5ek,Read a few pages of 'It ends with us'.,"I didn't read the reviews before buying the book. I only read a few pages and I felt:

1. I was reading a high-school/teenage 'romance' book.
2. Enraged and triggered as a rape survivor. 

I didn't even know the book had mentions of rape because it was so hyped I didn't want to spoil it for me a bit and just thought because everyone is loving it, it must be good. I got triggered in the initial rooftop scene where he kept insisting she fucks him and pulls her chair closer after she said no. I literally closed the book and cried. Then I went on google and reddit to read what it was about because I knew I am too weak rn to handle disturbing shit. My problem isn't reading about rape or things similar to it. My problem is the fucking romanticization of it. I read that this book is about CH's mother's experience. But the thing is, I read that she excused monstrous behavior by that guy and from what I gather from the few pages I read, she (Lily) must've been like he's-so-hot-and-masculine or whatever. CH doesn't know that people who go back to their abusers, who put up with people raping them and treating them like shit are doing that from a place of emotional turmoil and conflict and deep childhood traumas. To be fair, I don't know if this conflict is portrayed in Lily's internal dialogue but I don't want to find out. 

Books like these are so dangerous for young women and men to read. Especially ones in toxic relationships. Young people are easily influenced and trauma makes you isolate yourself so books are sort of like a way to relate to people. Does that make sense. I'm just really really angry and extremely sad right now. I went back to my abuser and it was not lovey-dovey like in the book. Sure I'm very sensitive about this topic but it just blows my mind how everyone was drooling over this book on tiktok and instagram when it came out.

The process of coming out of the toxic cycle and saving yourself from abuse is also a very very lonely journey. You lose friends. You lose family as you slowly realize no one gives a shit about what you went through, even if you give them all the details. So the notion of losing one guy and being 'rescued' by another also didn't sit right with me about the book.

This is the whole point of this post. I just wanted to rant. I don't know if I'm allowed to on this sub though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/z3w5ek/read_a_few_pages_of_it_ends_with_us/,2022-11-24T22:14:01Z,15,0,books,It Ends with Us,POST
10khi97,"Read ""It Ends with Us"" by CoHo. 1.5/5 ⭐","EDIT: this does contain spoilers for the book. So if you're  planing to read this book pls skip this post.

 I just finished this book and I gotta say I almost regret reading it. I don't like how the DV is basically used as like a plot twist. I think it's pretty irresponsible to not put a trigger warning for that along with the rape/SA. 

All the characters were pretty 2 dimensional as well. The abuse and the trauma is what made them and the story interesting (and i feel gross saying that). Outside of that, i didn't feel like any of the characters had a personality. 

I hated Ryle from the moment we met him. Atlas was mostly fine but boring and I'm uncomfortable with him being 18 and sleeping with a minor. Lily was also pretty plain and not that interesting. 

There were so many moments in this book that were comical in the worst way. I'd be reading through a very dark and serious part of the book and then suddenly lily would say ""just keep swimming"" and like... That just ruined the moment. How am I suppose to take this seriously??

 I don't think abuse and trauma should be used as a plot twist and trauma also is not a personality trait. If you can only make a character interesting by giving them some sad backstory or making them go through trauma then you're just not a good writer.  That's basically sums up how I felt about the book.

I did like the convo in chapter 32 that Lily and her mom had. I feel like that's a good thing to read especially for those people who say ""well, if he hits you, why don't you just leave?"" It puts things into perspective more and shows that it's not all that black and white. 

Overall tho, did not enjoy it.

Edit: i did wanna add that I'm aware that this book is based off of Colleen's mom and dad and I read her author's note at the end. That still doesn't change my overall view of this book. I feel that the  DV in this book was dealt with in an immature way, in the sense that i feel like it diminishes the real impact this kind of thing can have on people in real life. Ryle had no consequences whatsoever for his actions and I don't think Lily divorcing him counted as a consequence",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10khi97/read_it_ends_with_us_by_coho_155/,2023-01-24T21:57:13Z,16,24,books,It Ends with Us,POST

In the epilogue at the end of ‘It Ends With Us’ Lily says she moved out of the apartment Ryle Bought for them when Emmy was 3 months old. But in the new book it mentioned in chapter 4 that ryle had a key to her place before Emmy was born in case she went into labour…. 

Have I missed something? Am I reading this wrong.

I feel like the author has messed up but is that common for the story to change from the epilogue?

uri0xc,What did you guys think of It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover?,">!My initial thoughts were that some of the writing was a bit cringe especially on the rooftop in the first scene. It did read a bit like a teenager's fantasy. !< 

>!That being said I also enjoyed some of Lily's monologue it was entertaining somewhat. !<

>!I did not enjoy the journal entries. I feel like they could have been given one chapter or even one conversation. But it was truly unnecessary going through all of Ellen's shows and redundant info before visiting memories of Atlas.!<

>!I was glad with the ending though at least she got away. It would have been awful to go through all of that not so great writing and she ended up with Ryle.!<

>!Also the name Ryle irked me everytime I had to read it. It's either Riley or Kyle. Make up your mind.!<

10c3338,"""It Ends With Us"" by Colleen Hoover - It felt like I was reading fan fiction written by a teen. Absolutely no depth.","I don't think I've read a more superficial book, it was so odd! There were so many things that were brought up, and then never referred to again. The pacing felt rushed, like in one instance there was a header of ""six months later"" and then in another she made reference in pacing to being a few months later.

>!Lily - I did not relate to her character at all. I think she had many good qualities (helping Atlas, starting her own shop, etc.), but there was no reflection on her actions. It made me sad and furious when she found out she was pregnant. Another abused woman stuck in an abusive marriage, now pregnant with a child she didn't want. (\*\*Though if that was fully her choice to keep the pregnancy, I support that). Her only real thought was like, ""guess I'm not being consistent with my pill!"". I wish we could have seen her weigh her options a bit more, either with terminating the pregnancy or why she wanted to keep it. At the end I like how she showed some growth, but again, no reflection.!<

>!Ryle - Ugh. What a piece of shit. I actually thought we were going to find out he sabotaged Lily's birth control so she would get pregnant.!<

>!Allysa - I don't want to place a ton of blame on her when Ryle is the true evil, but I did not like her character at all and was annoyed at how much of an enabler she was. At first it was obvious she knew something was up and felt unease when Lily and Ryle got together. I thought it was because she knew he had a history of being manipulative and physically abusive with women, but that went away as soon as they were ""SISTERS!!!!"". Ugh. And don't get me started on how she wanted to work because she was ""bored"". She and her husband (I don't remember his name) seemed to enjoy flaunting their wealth in front of Lily.!<

>!Atlas - The most likeable and interesting character, but I found it icky that he was 18 and trying to get with a 15 y/o!<

>!Ellen DeGeneres/journal entries - This aged well lol. Normally in books I've read, the flashback is a new chapter, so it was something different that it was Lily rereading the journal, within the present day. It was actually pretty creative, but there was too much emphasis on Ellen and Dory.!<

>!My takeaway was the book was about the growth of a woman finding herself and escaping an abusive relationship, but it was so poorly written. I think it would be a better book if another author wrote it.!<",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10c3338/it_ends_with_us_by_colleen_hoover_it_felt_like_i/,2023-01-14T22:48:13Z,35,86,books,It Ends with Us,POST

tkwby9,It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover taught me a valuable lesson,"And it's that a book doesn't have to be *technically* good in order for me to devour it. And that's okay!

It Ends With Us was my first Colleen Hoover book, so I wasn't aware of what her style of writing would be or what her books are generally like. It's just a title I heard a lot and thought I'd give it a go after hearing how many people loved it. 

I found that her writing style wasn't anything special. I found the characters' names to be incredibly cringey - Ryle Kincaid? Atlas Corrigan? These are cheesey romance novel names if I've ever heard them. I had a lot of initial thoughts when I started reading it and none of them were that good.

But... I finished it in a couple of days. I couldn't put it down. There was something strangely addictive about it. I loved it even though there were so many things about it that told me that it wasn't that technically good. And it turns out that it doesn't matter. If it entertains you, or moves you, or teaches you something, or keeps your mind focused... then it's good and it's okay to enjoy those things. Not everything has to be a masterpiece.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tkwby9/it_ends_with_us_by_colleen_hoover_taught_me_a/,2022-03-23T15:21:24Z,11,64,books,It Ends with Us,POST

I'm sure guilts eating him up, so what? If my dad did this to my mom before I was born, no matter how sweet and guilty he feels I would hope he got severely punished, for a long time. And also the fact that even after he hurt her, even after he tried to r her, he still kept begging her to stay with him. If he knows how he gets sometimes, and if he really loved Lily, he would distance himself before it even got so far. He's horribly selfish, and couldn't even understand how wrong it was before he got his own daughter. I wished to see him in jail, or to be honest dead.

qznrm3,Unpopular Opinion (It ends with us): Lily doesn't deserve someone like Atlas,"I am not referring to Lilly and Ryle. That was CLEARLY a huge mistake of Lilly. She was completely aware since the beginning that the guy was a freak (telling her phrases about sex since the very first minutes they met). She knew since the beginning he was no good guy.

&#x200B;

What I mean is that the story between Lilly and Atlas is SO WRONG. Teenage Lilly deserved someone like Atlas. They were so cute and tender,made for each other.

&#x200B;

What was wrong is that Atlas was too good for her. While he looked for her she was in college having her hook ups with other guys. Shallow stories but she ended uo having sex with them. Same for Ryle. She ended up with him only for the sex. The scenes were so hard to read. She was just being used by him and let him willingly do that. Like a cheap w\*\*\*\*. Sorry to say it but it was no longer the shy and innocent teenage Lilly. And then after all the sex she gets pregnant and guess who has to accept the little ba\*tard child?  Atlas. Poor Atlas.

He is just a saint and she doesn't deserve him. At all. Lilly deserved him if she hadn't willingly had sex with all those boys after him. It's just so wrong and makes me feel sick for him.

&#x200B;

But in real life is like this. Crazy rich spoiled alpha male has sex with cute girl, gets her pregnant,nice guy forgives her and raises the b\*\*\*\*\*\*child.

I would have never accepted such girl for a wife and such child.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qznrm3/unpopular_opinion_it_ends_with_us_lily_doesnt/,2021-11-22T15:20:35Z,19,0,books,It Ends with Us,POST

SPOILER ALERT.

Ok can someone please help a girl out..

In the epilogue at the end of ‘It Ends With Us’ Lily says she moved out of the apartment Ryle Bought for them when Emmy was 3 months old. But in the new book it mentioned in chapter 4 that ryle had a key to her place before Emmy was born in case she went into labour….

Have I missed something? Am I reading this wrong.

I feel like the author has messed up but is that common for the story to change from the epilogue?

ns986k,Book Review: It Ends With Us - Colleen Hoover.,"Genre: Fiction/ Romance novel/ Contemporary romance. 

Rating: 5/5 stars. 

**DISCLAIMER**: 

* TW: Sexual assault. 
* CONTAINS SPOILERS. 
* Finally, know that this book shouldn’t be read before going to bed, trust me it will prevent you from sleeping. 

>***“There is no such thing as ‘bad people’. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”*** 

Hello everyone and welcome back! Today's book revolves around Colleen Hoover...that’s it. Hoover is known for a variety of her books, the most popular of them being this one. Now, I've never been a fan of the Romance genre but I do enjoy books that make me bawl my eyes out. This book was definitely one of them. *It Ends with Us* was a success both critically & in the eyes of fans, winning the Goodreads Choice Award for Best Romance. 

>Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So, when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. 

I’m going to divide the review into two parts –

1-3 stars – As I mentioned earlier, I'm not a fan of Romance novels. So, my initial thoughts were that this book follows the pattern of *After* and *50 shades*. I know they’re not the same but this is basically the storyline – A rich man and a not-so-rich woman fall in love. The woman later finds that the man has grown from a traumatic childhood that led him to be an abusive, unstable person when it comes to relationships. While reading Part One, I noticed this pattern and felt annoyed to have picked this book. 

3-5 stars – It was after reading Part Two that I felt the triggers. Yet, I kept going because I had a feeling that the ending would slap my face and it did. It was the last chapter that broke me. Reading Ryle’s emotions had me \*CRYING SO HARD\* that I wanted Lily to take her word back. When I read “It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”, I was done. I felt a stab in my heart. Not because of what Lily decided (she made an awesome decision) but because I saw Lily and Ryle separate. Till the epilogue, I told myself “If Lily & Atlas got back together, I'd be happy” until it actually happened, and I don’t think I was up for it. This was because the epilogue kind of left me confused. I wanted a little more about it. I wanted to know how Ryle would react to this because I cannot get over Ryle and Lily (T\_T) though I know how he’d possibly react because now they are divorced. 

Although the characters are fictional, they have elements of realism in them – 

*Lily*'s was the most powerful character. Her character may not be relatable to everyone, but it still managed to reach out. She was resilient and courageous. *Brave and bold*, just like her mother asked her to be. 

*Ryle* was charming. A thriving neurosurgeon who’s willing to be better for Lily? YES. I honestly felt extreme sorrow for him but there’s nothing that could be done for his behaviour. 

*Atlas* was a sweet one. He was just the perfect guy Lily deserved. 

*Alyssa* and *Marshall* – God. They helped me laugh through the overwhelming moments of the story. The friendship between Lily & Alyssa was the sweetest. 

I must say, the author really poured her soul into this book. I underestimated this book to be a typical romantic story but oh no, I was so wrong. Also, the author’s note left me with another wave of shock. Overall, this novel is an emotional rollercoaster that will surely leave any reader stunned. 

&#x200B;

srn7dk,"Re-reading ""It ends with us"" by Colleen Hoover changed my opinion (SPOILERS)","So when I first time read this book, I loved it. I didn't really like her writing style, though but I loved the topic and the execution.Especially as an abuse survivor.

Now I read it again and.... I cannot see why I liked it the first time. I hate it.The premise is amazing but the execution more than terrible. And to put it frankly, quite dangerous as well (why comes later).

First of all: still didn't like the writing style. But reading it a second time made me genuinely cringe.The characters are awfully written and unrealistic.Why?Let's see.We have:Lily: she saw her father abusing her mother for years and even raping her. This naturally leaves emotional scars. There was never any mention of a therapist for her. Yet, she is successful and has her own business. Not to forget that she gets abused, ends up pregnant but still manages to be successful. Without therapy of course.

Atlas: got abused by his stepfather and his mother never intereferred. He got kicked out and was homeless for how long? Half a year? A year? He goes to his uncle and later military. Never was any therapy mentioned. Yet, he is successful and has his own restaurant.

Alyssa: Her brother killed (by accident) her other brother. She has a filthy rich husband and only works for Lily as she likes her and is bored. Her brother died, yet no mention of therapy for her.

Ryle: He killed his brother by accident. He is a successful neurosurgeon and marries Lily, although he is in the beginning completely against relationships. He is the only one in the book that sees a therapist.The author uses his childhood trauma to explain his behavior (she doesn't use it to excuse it).  
Also he is all in all not only a walking red flag but a red air raid siren displaying abusive behavior.   
Thought that him taking a picture of Lily on the chair is romantic? Nope. Red flag. She did not consent! 

Ryle is where my first problem starts. Some abusers have an explanation why they are like this. Some.My abuser didn't. He had everything.Some abusers don't need a reason for being abusive! Some just do it for no reason at all.Yet, this book let's you think that maybe your abuser has one. Maybe he has some trauma.This book is aimed towards young adults, with little love life experience (probably).Next problem: later on Lily leaves Ryle to break the cycle of abuse. Not for herself. But for her daughter. As if this could protect her daughter from being abused later on. It can happen to anyone!You don't need a reason to leave your abuser other than this person being abusive.Yet, this book seems to tell you that you need a reason.Next problem: Lily DOES NOT report Ryle. Someone in the comments weeks ago says she does. But upon re-reading it: where? Did I miss this part? She does not report Ryle as he is a father now.Basically: this book is telling you that you cannot report an abuser if that person is a father, as the child would grow up in a broken family.In my opinion, as an abuse survivor, this comes verrrrrryyyyyyy close to victim shaming.

Someone already said weeks ago, that the author can tell her own narrative and how she wants it.As an abuse survivor I hardly disagree when it comes to the topic of abuse. Especially when it is aimed towards young adults.

All in all, this book didn't feel like educating on abuse but rather on: when and when not to report your abuser. If he has a career, childhood trauma and is a father: DO NOT report him.This is what it felt like to me and thus, it leaves a dangerous message.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/srn7dk/rereading_it_ends_with_us_by_colleen_hoover/,2022-02-13T16:59:48Z,10,13,books,It Ends with Us,POST

I love all the characters in this book which is not something I can say for many other books that I've read over the years. Ryle was flawed in every sense but I respected the easy he handled shit in the end. And Atlas? I mean c'mon.

12nmz5g,Lily Bloom from 'It Ends With Us' - A Heroine Who Will Steal Your Heart and Inspire You to Be Brave,"Hello, fellow readers!

I just finished reading ""It Ends With Us"" by Colleen Hoover, and I have to say, Lily Bloom is one of the most inspiring heroines I've ever encountered in fiction. Her journey from a young woman falling in love to a strong and empowered survivor of domestic abuse is both heartbreaking and uplifting, and it's impossible not to root for her every step of the way.

At the beginning of the novel, Lily is a charming and relatable protagonist who is just starting to build a life for herself in Boston. She's running her own business, has a supportive best friend, and meets the handsome and charismatic Ryle Kincaid, who seems like the perfect match for her. But as their relationship deepens, Lily begins to uncover a darker side of Ryle, and she's forced to confront her own painful history of abuse.

What I love most about Lily is her resilience and her willingness to confront difficult truths, even when they are painful. She's not a perfect character, but her flaws only make her more relatable and human. As she navigates the complicated dynamics of her relationship with Ryle, she also learns to confront her own fears and insecurities, and to find the strength to break the cycle of abuse that has plagued her family for generations.

But what really makes Lily stand out is her courage. She's not content to simply survive - she wants to thrive, and she's willing to make the hard choices necessary to build a better life for herself and those she loves. She's a heroine who will steal your heart and inspire you to be brave in your own life, no matter what challenges you may face.

If you're looking for a novel with a strong and empowering female protagonist, ""It Ends With Us"" and Lily Bloom should be at the top of your reading list. Trust me, you won't be able to put this book down, and you'll be thinking about Lily long after you've turned the last page.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12nmz5g/lily_bloom_from_it_ends_with_us_a_heroine_who/,2023-04-15T23:32:37Z,5,0,books,It Ends with Us,POST

The relationships didn't seem to be much convincing ( everyone seems to be best of friends in no time).

Moreover, every character seems to have something wrong with them as if the book tries to cover a lot of themes, but it kinda ends up making the book a jumble of words full of emotional manipulation.

When i finished reading it i realized that before i was also one of those people who always wondered why some people would still stay with their abuser and not get away or ask for help, now I realize how ignorant i was and never really thought about the whole perspective respectfully. As the books said not everything is black or white and we humans sometimes forget that and judge people precisely on our own thoughts rather than trying to understand them. I’m grateful that this book reminded me of that and I’ll try to work harder to improve myself regarding these thoughts.

wqno4w,I’ve just finished rereading the Percy Jackson series as an adult. Here’s what it taught me.,"As an English major without much free time on my hands, I’ve spent the last few years reading mostly assigned literature; think your standard classics, with a few oddballs thrown in. And, don’t get me wrong, most are well deserving of their place on the shelves of history. However, I was starting to lose sight of the reason I was studying English in the first place, the reason I hope to teach it one day. I was starting to forget the magic. 

So, during my two weeks of down time, I picked up a book I haven’t thought about in over ten years: Percy Jackson and the Olympians, book one. The Lightning Thief. When I was in elementary school, the five short novels in this series were everything to me, along with your standard Harry Potter’s and LOTR’s (the latter of which I liked to pretend I could understand at such a young age). But, as I aged, I found my memory of them had all but disappeared. So I set off on a brief journey, back into the world of Rick Riordan, and was amazed at what I found. 

I spent the first few chapters in English major mode, picking apart errors in grammar, pacing, plot, etc. I forced myself to stop; these books were not written for me. They were written for a childhood version of myself, and he positively adored them. So I read on, becoming more and more engrossed in the story, simultaneously reliving moments of my youth that had attached themselves to specific passages or plot points. 

Five novels later, I was in tears. As I closed The Last Olympian, I felt incredibly sad that the story had ended, that I would be forced to retreat from this magical world of gods and monsters. And I felt myself wishing, hoping beyond hope, that perhaps the story was real after all. We all know the feeling. I hadn’t felt that sense of wonder in many years. 

My advice to you all: read children’s literature. It is the reason so many of us are passionate about reading in the first place, but it so often falls by the wayside as we age. The lessons within are invaluable. They teach us to view the world with empathy and wonder. They teach us to see the magic. 

Next time you’re in the library, do yourself a favor. Head for the children’s section, and find a book that tugs at the back of your memory, an old love long forgotten and dulled by time. Pick it up, sit down, and start reading. You might just learn a thing or two.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wqno4w/ive_just_finished_rereading_the_percy_jackson/,2022-08-17T12:25:52Z,263,1951,books,It Ends with Us,POST
m98xyh,"Romeo and Juliet is NOT a romance, it is an allegory about the dangers of making big decisions based on emotion alone","It's not a tragic romance about true love- it's a warning not to let yourself be ruled by your emotions alone.

The parents are ruled by a grudge preventing the happiness of their children and causing violence and death in the town they live in because neither wants to forgive the other. Like, their *unnamed* grudge causes fights to break out in the streets, causes deaths of people who have nothing to do with their grudge. You could make the argument that the fact that no one can name what caused this animosity, that it must not have even been so terrible, and they are holding onto it all out of pride.

Romeo is introduced to us by saying how he wants to *kill himself* because his romance with Rosaline ended, then immediately falls in love with the first cute chick he sees that same night, implying that he falls in love easily- that he is more in love with being in love than anything else. This is further exemplified by the fact that, unlike with many of Shakespeare's couples in other plays, we really don't get a chance to see either Romeo and Juliet as individuals with their own personalities other than ""in love"". Romeo, what about Juliet do you love so much other than her appearance? Anything? Wit? Kindness? Determination? What, other than appearance, makes her worthy of your obsession? He never takes the time to praise anything other than her surface qualities.

Romeo allows his obsession to shut down any thought of the potential consequences in eloping with Juliet. This is seen by how cluelessly he responds to Tybalt on encountering him, post marriage. He doesn't even behave rationally, just thinking: Well, I love Juliet and she loves you, therefore we're buds now.

As for Tybalt, his failure is giving in to blind rage, provoking a fight between himself and Romeo, which results in Tybalt's death.

Mercutio is pissed cuz he knew all of this needless fighting and death was based on these two families being made up of absolute drama queens all worked up over some straight-up bullshit and that *none of this had to be this way,* but because Romeo is his himbo friend he goes ahead and gets murked trying to keep his buddy from killing himself. This is why he dies like: ""For the record, you guys' families are toxic af. Bleeehhhhh...""

Finally, if Romeo had given a moment to think about *anything at all* in the crypt (self-reflection, analyzing the damage this family grudge has done to everyone, commentary on the crypt's interior decor) rather than *immediately making decisions based on his powerful emotions* neither Romeo nor Juliet would have died.

Stop teaching Romeo and Juliet as a romance. Especially to teens. Teens are *often* influenced by their emotions into making knee-jerk decisions that they often come to regret or have dangerous consequences. They *need* to hear the allegory as it was intended to be taken.

&#x200B;

Edit: no, I didn't *just* realize this. I am frustrated because as a librarian that works with teens, I have heard this is how it's being taught to them, and when I was in high school I was also taught to interpret it as a sad love story about true love. I am frustrated to hear that it is still being taught this way by at least some teachers.

&#x200B;

Edit edit: I did not add the spoiler tag. No clue why it's there, but meh.

&#x200B;

Edit the 3rd: Some of you guys are thinking I see this as my raison d'etre or that I'm rabidly angry about this, but really it's just an annoyance. I ended up really liking Shakespeare in college but the way Romeo and Juliet was taught to me in high school had left me feeling frustrated and angry and I just assumed it was because I must not like Shakespeare. So I missed out on really enjoying his works for years because I assumed that my frustration was with Shakespeare's work, rather than my teacher's interpretation of it.

pzlpy7,Finished Slaughterhouse-Five. Feeling some type of way. So it goes.,"\-Damn. Fucking hell this book was good. I have read Vonnegut before and appreciated his wit and storytelling ability, but this was my first go at Slaughterhouse-Five. I feel speechless.

\- I am in the military. I have deployed myself, but never off to something so powerful as a World War. So, I often read about war, about my brothers and sisters of the past, with a type of awe reserved for ancient marvels of history. These silhouettes of the past are people who saw things, and did things, I will never fully understand, or possibly relate to. I feel that here with Vonnegut. It is no secret that the bombing of Dresden changed him, maybe even killed a little bit of his soul. I feel it  painfully, mournfully in all of his writings, like exhaling with broken ribs. I, too, have been fortunate enough to have traveled to places around the world near and dear to me. Okinawa, Japan. Crete, Greece. Belfast, Ireland. Cebu, Philippines. I can only imagine how distraught I'd be to see one of these places under siege, by the country I am sworn to protect. Vonnegut lived that. His outlooks on war, government, society... it's all very telling. He was a brilliant man, and just an absolutely masterful storyteller.

\- Most of Vonnegut's writings make me laugh, and this one did too. Some of the insane situations Billy Pilgrim finds himself in are classic Vonnegut. But, this book was so much deeper than merely a comedy. I thought a lot about Catch-22, here. I also caught myself reflecting on what it means to really live and perish. Time, here, is such a key element, and you wonder how it all truly affects us. What happens when it's all over? Is it ever truly over? To live eternally through windows of time is a romantic notion, and one Vonnegut has me thinking about. His narratives on the war also provide such a striking emotion. Events occur here most sad and horrible, and his matter-of-fact way of relating these events somehow packs more of a punch. Like ""oh well"" such is life now. So it goes.

\- Reading how the bombing of Dresden was worse than Hiroshima is pretty enlightening too. Many of us don't realize the awfulness of this event in particular. War is always a tragedy. But, I think Dresden doesn't get its due in classrooms in schools, because of how we still like to portray Americans and Germans in history courses. We think its cool, I suppose. But, again, reading of Vonnegut's observations on the bombing crushes me. Dresden is like a lover who has passed away, never to return. Except in memory. There is an eternal sadness in Billy Pilgrim that never really goes away throughout the story, no matter what time period he is in, or what event is occurring. It all goes back to the war in the end. We forget how these wars still changed lives years and years and years after they were over. They did give us Kurt Vonnegut, however. That I am thankful for.

\- I am not sure what else to say. Read this book if you want to have your mind tested and ideals challenged. Read this book if you want to get a glimpse into the suffering, the senselessness, the aftermath of life as a prisoner of war. Read this book if you like wit, and an author's ability to tell you the ending in the beginning, and tie everything up along the way. Read this book for Kilgore Trout and Montana Wildhack. I loved every line of Schlachthaus fünf. I think you will too. 

\-I leave you with this one excerpt which made me laugh and hurt:

""Billy looked inside the latrine. The wailing was coming from in there. The place was crammed with Americans who had taken their pants down. The welcome feast had made them as sick as volcanoes. The buckets were full or had been kicked over. An American near Billy wailed that he had excreted everything but his brains. Moments later he ""There they go, there they go"". He meant his brains. That was I. That was me. That was the author of this book.""

\- Everything was beautiful, and nothing hurt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pzlpy7/finished_slaughterhousefive_feeling_some_type_of/,2021-10-02T01:31:43Z,215,1714,books,It Ends with Us,POST
1ap84k5,"Growing up, it seemed like Tom Clancy was everywhere. I can see why, but the books didn't age well.","In the 90's, you'd always see one of his books on shelves at the bookstore, grocery store, airport. And a new movie or show was always coming out, with his name attached. I was more into detective books for most of my life. But after watching the Jack Ryan TV series, I figured I'd try the books.

This is sort of a multi-book review, sorry, it's long.

For a first novel, The Hunt for Red October really was a banger. The inside of a sub is a weird, claustrophobic setting, and makes for some interesting built-in tension... You're in this huge, slow-moving whale of a ship, which can't reasonably dodge attacks, and if you get hit, everyone on board dies a horrifying death. The level of detail really sells it, you'd swear Tom Clancy spent half his life in a sub, but he was never in the military (except for going into the ROTC and being dq'd for eyesight). Before writing books, he sold insurance.

Clancy goes into the circumstances that might cause an embittered high-level submarine captain to defect, he talks about people's motivations and backgrounds quite a bit, so it's not all dry technical military stuff. The captain comes up with a clever plan to make his defection happen, which necessitates murdering the always-present political officer during a deployment, and duping the crew into thinking it was an accident. The plan nearly falls apart at the finish line, and we're introduced to lowly CIA analyst Jack Ryan, who comes up with his own plan to protect Captain Ramius, save the crew, and somehow acquire the sub. At the end, Ryan survives a shootout, and we establish that the hero has both brains and brawn.

So, I decide to continue the series, and for a while, it's pretty good.

Patriot Games puts Ryan into a more personal conflict with a branch of the IRA, shows how he came to be at the CIA, and establishes his credibility as an action hero. He's maybe a little too perfect, as protagonists go, but likeable. He's a former marine, which establishes him as a trained badass, but has a back injury that causes him to walks with a limp, which makes him seem little more humble and vulnerable. This somehow doesn't stop him from surviving gunfights, and later... the author writes away his crippling injury with a genius medical procedure. 

He's always portrayed as this honorable boy scout (literally) who just wants to do his duty and protect his family. Along the way, he gets to be a millionaire (thanks to a bit of technically-legal insider trading, and this is the closest he comes to having a flaw) So now the hero is rich, which is something I've seen a lot of authors do, to sort of handwave away a lot of the everyday life challenges that might keep the protagonist from going on adventures. 

The Cardinal of the Kremlin revisits the idea of protecting a Russian defector, or rather, a high-level bureaucrat who has been passing info to the CIA for years, and along the way, Ryan somehow forces the KGB chairman to come along. We get to see him less as an action hero, and more as a smart guy who has to work out the political angles. We spend a lot of time in Russia, which sort of puts him in the lion's den. The book is a bit of a slog, but I think Clancy's portrayal of Russia is one of his strengths, he seems comfortable with talking about the quirks of russian politics, and his characters are fleshed out.

Clear and Present Danger was, for me, a minor dud. The US president is in a tight race to get re-elected, and the public thinks he's ineffective at stopping drug trafficking, so he initiates a bunch of small, covert military actions in Columbia to wreck the drug kingpin's operations. It's probably illegal, despite the pretext that the drug trade is a 'clear and present danger' to national security, and it feels a bit like Clancy writing up a daydream fantasy of ""what if we just bombed these scumbags?"". There's a subplot where some hardened rapist smugglers are put through a mock execution and the Coast Guard captain who does this is sort of given a token finger wag for it. There is a somewhat interesting perspective from the generic kingpin's right-hand-man, a well-trained spy who seduces a secretary (we'll see that again later) and gets critical information, which is used to blow up the director of the FBI and the head of the DEA. The president counters by having the kingpin's mansion bombed during a meeting with other high-level baddies. Jack Ryan is basically just there to get outraged when the president decides to leave the small special forces group stranded in indian country, and helps extract them when the administration was prepared to write them off. 

I was left with the feeling that Clancy's understanding of South America just isn't really as nuanced as his portrayal of Russia, and the characters are more simplistic. The cartel kingpin is blustery, a sort of tinpot tyrant, his henchmen are just generic bad guys.

The Sum of All Fears is much better, and it's where the author starts to peak, but also kind of the beginning of the end for Jack Ryan. 

The plot is very slow-burn, detailing how some terrorists gain access to an unexploded nuclear bomb... it was loaded during a tense moment in the middle east, was supposed to be unloaded, but an over-eager pilot takes off with it and gets shot down, and the bomb is lost in some farmer's field, where it's rediscovered 20 years later. For most of the book, tension is built as the terrorists find allies and gain the technical resources needed to restore it to operation, and they decide to target the Super Bowl stadium in Denver. Ryan meanwhile, isn't clued into this for most of the book because he's dealing with a smear campaign from the white house foreign affairs advisor. If Jack wasn't heroic enough yet, he literally brings peace to the middle east. But the advisor, a careerist who's found her way into the president's bed, has a grudge because Jack was snippy to her once. So she robs him of credit. Then uses investigators to dig up dirt on him, which leads to whispers that he's cheating on his wife. These are false, of course, because Jack Ryan's a bit of a saint. 

How much of a saint? Ryan regularly visits a widow, because he watched her husband die during a military mission, and has vowed to put all 10(!) of his kids through college. He makes good on his promise. The good-guyness of Jack Ryan can, at times, be a bit overdone.

I like the book because the author isn't afraid to avoid the predictable ""good guys foil the plot at the last second"" ending, and without totally spoiling everything... the bomb does go off, and the terrorists are portrayed as very sharp, initiating some false-flag attacks with Russia to distract everyone from the real culprits and let their enemies destroy each other. But Jack figures this out, realizing that that the president is being manipulated by his mistress into a possible nuclear war. There's sort of a Cuban Missile Crisis moment, and he figures out a way to avert war despite his warnings falling on deaf ears... by directly contacting the Russian president and explaining the situation. 

President Fowler overreacts when he realizes the true source of the threat, and orders a rage-induced nuclear strike on the middle east, but Ryan again steps in and saves the day by making use of the two-man rule, which (if you're old enough) you may have seen before in WarGames. We see him deliver a thorough chiding, which is deserved, but makes the character start to feel less like a boy scout analyst and occasional action hero, and more like a moral authority whose crowning moments come down to him wagging his finger and really telling someone off. 

I skipped Without Remorse, which is an origin story for one of the recurring characters, a former SEAL and master spy named John Clark. 

Debt of Honor might be where the series starts to flag, but it has a killer ending. A flaw in the gas tanks of a few Japanese cars leads to a highly publicized accident leading to a handful of deaths. Politicians sieze on this to enact a new trade policy with Japan... the country is portrayed as being under the control of a handful of corrupt industrialists who have exploited an unequal trade policy for years to gain control in American markets. The new policy threatens these industrialists, who hatch a plot to retaliate, which is partially fueled by one man's personal hatred of America. 

This book feels like it has a more overtly political message, and is clearly an exension of the author's political beliefs. There's some token effort to explain Japanese culture and the mindset of the bad guys, but they're still very much the bad guys, portrayed as misguided and greedy, with somewhat less depth than the Russians tend to get in his earlier books. There was a minute, during the 90's, where Japan and its culture were this cool mysterious thing... we had movies like Rising Sun, which I think helped coax this book into existence. And maybe James Clavell's work was an influence?

One area that I like about the book is, they explore an interesting idea on what economic warfare might look like, and gets into cyberwarfare a bit, though there's also the obligatory military clashes. Japan seizes control of the Marianas, a US territory, and attacks some military assets, hiding behind the claim that it was an unfortunate accident, one that makes their seizure of the territory possible. Ryan figures out a neat, ""so simple it's brilliant"" way to save the economy, and advises the president in a way that results in a tidy, more-or-less proportional response that hurts the Japanese economy and a few of their own boats and aircraft, leading to surrender. Then, at the last minute, it all goes to shit, and I'll try to avoid a spoiler except to say that Clancy looks like he saw 9/11 coming back in 1994 early.

By the next book, Jack Ryan is president, and for me... President Ryan is a lot less interesting than humble CIA analyst Ryan. The bad guys this time are Muslim extremists, led by an ambitious Iranian leader who orchestrates the assasination of the Iraqi president, and successfully invades, ""uniting"" the countries. He then quietly has a team engineer a nasty bio-warfare weapon based on Ebola. Anyone who grew up in the 90's might again get that feeling that... these books are very much of their time. ""Outbreak"" (which features a similar disaster) comes out in 1995, and one year later, we have Executive Orders. 

The book does an excellent job of building up several subplots, disasters that put the weight of the world on the president's shoulders. Besides the disease, Jack has to rebuild a crippled government where a lot of the key positions are unfilled, and is taking constant heat in the press. The VP of the last president, was forced to resign for sexual assault, but now is trying to walk it back by orchestrating a technicality that would allow him to claim he's the real president. If Jack is able to survive this, he's still probably heading for doom... one of secret service team is a sleeper agent for the baddies. Meanwhile, there's a plan to kidnap his daughter from daycare. And finally, there's a (honestly unnecessary) subplot where domestic terrorists are trucking a load of fertilizer bombs to the white house. 

It's a pretty ambitious book that explores a lot of ""what-if"" scenarios, but it's somewhat less satisfying for me because the good guys just beat everything. Not effortlessly, at least, but... the kidnappers get outsmarted and blown away, the nutty militia guys get caught before they do any real harm, someone picks up on the sleeper agent's very small errors, the sneaky backdoor coup by the former vice president fizzles, and the damage from the outbreak is minimized by Jack Ryan simply having the national guard restrict travel and tell everyone to stay home and mask up. We can all have a good laugh about the plausibility of that, in retrospect. But it does also occur to me... to Clancy's credit, his far-fetched disaster senarios are actually not so far-fetched. 

It's a good read, just that it feels like the success of the evil plot feels much less ""oh wow, he went there"" than it did in Sum of All Fears. I can see why this book somehow wasn't movie material despite all sorts of dramatic potential. 

Rainbox Six is probably the most standard action-movie material in the books, getting away somewhat from politics and spy stuff and focusing on a bunch of guys who basically shoot guns real good. The focus is on Clark and Chavez, side characters from previous books who are running an elite counterterrorism unit. Coincidentally (or maybe not), this unit comes into existence around the same time as a spike in seemingly random terrorist events... events which are not-so-random, it turns out. The book has a fairly absurd plot where extreme environmentalists decide to end the world with a bioweapon, and it was kind of a weird call by Clancy to dive back into ""Super ebola"" when he just did that in the previous book. The bad guys are cartoonishly deluded and sociopathic, and the stakes absurdly high, and so some tension is removed because clearly Clancy isn't going to let the bad guys kill 7 billion people, unless he's transitioning from military fiction to The Walking Dead.

I decided to quit the books after The Bear and the Dragon... the pacing is lousy, the politics are SUPER heavy-handed, and the plot is too much of a rehash of previous material. It generally feels less plausible, and the bad guys more cartoonish than ever before. It's Debt of Honor in a scooby doo villain mask. 

Instead of Japan leveraging an uneven trade relationship, it's China. Instead of a small family being blown up by shoddy workmanship, leading to a US boycott... it's a papal ambassador getting blown up by Chinese cops, leading to a US boycott. Pissed off president enacts a new stricter trade policy, and the other country panics and retaliates... in this case, by trying to invade Russia and steal a wealth of recently-discovered natural resources. Once again, we have a secretary to a high-level politication getting seduced, leading to criticial info. Except she kind of just gigglingly says ""ok I'll install spyware on my PC for you"" because the CIA spy gives her good dick. It's a lot less nuanced than the seduction of the FBI director's assistant in Clear and Present Danger. The ministers simply decide to start a war with Russia (and, by extension, USA and NATO) and somehow the voice of reason gets shouted down. They bank on a military advantage, but the advantages gets wiped out by new space-age technology, and just like that... the war is over, the warmongers are deposed, the arrogant foreigners are put in their place. It's all very on-the-nose, and just kind of feels like ""USA smart and good, China dumb and bad"". There's a brief nuclear scare that feels contrived and has the kind of ""good guys always win at the last minute"" ending that Clancy avoided in earlier books.

---

tl;dr

So... Clancy's strengths: 

The books are always steeped in technical detail, which really adds to the realism. When he talks about life in a sub, you'd swear he spent months at sea. When he talks about how they repair and improve the yield of this nuke, you'd swear he spent the last ten years working on nuclear bombs. He sounds like he's done his homework on everything from the internal politics of the CIA, to the black markets that sprung up after the fall of Communism, to the technical challenges of shooting down a missile.

The dialogue is mostly solid, with the occasional contrived and theatrical monologue. Jack Ryan gets increasingly preachy in later books, and several characters jump on soapboxes. 

The books are very ambitious, trying to delve into exactly what it must feel like to be a fly on the wall when a president decides to launch nukes, or send troops somewhere, or fend of political attacks, or make a difficult and unpopular decision to handle a national crisis. Everything has this huge geopolitical scale, except maybe the 2nd book where it's a little more about Ryan and his family being directly targeted. 

But the thing that killed the books for me (and this gets worse and worse, over the years) is the politics. 

The plots are very much the product of Clancy's political views, and his upbringing during the cold war. At first, it's not too bad. I lean left, but I thought ""ok, this guy's conservative, but he seems sane. I could talk to this guy"". The Russians go from the bad guys, to frenemies, to simply friends, and I remember during the 90's that it was kind of hip for the younger generation to talk about supporting Russia, I guess rebelling against parents who ranted angrily about commies. You'd hear American throw around terms like glasnost and perestroika, something I remember even as a high-schooler with zero interest in politics. Tom Clancy's Russians seem fleshed out, not too stereotypical, with a variety of perspectives and motivations. 

His Columbians are cartoonish, desperate peasant workers, lazy and careless soldiers, and a kingpin who is straight out of every bad action movie. The Chinese are depicted as completely alien, with irrational and arrogant mindsets, several times Jack Ryan refers to them as ""Klingons"" because their thinking is just so impenetrable and foreign. And if any readers might be bothered by the terms ""Chinks"" or ""Japs"", well... you're gonna be seeing a lot of that. 

There's too many unnecessary detours into thinly veiled political rants. If you were wondering about Clancy's stance on abortion, gun control, the war on drugs, military spending, tax policy, foreign policy, or the environment... don't worry, he'll tell you. He'll contrive a scene where the wealthy good-guy former hedge fund manager talks tells you how those 'little slant-eyed fucks' are screwing America with their trade policies. He'll contrive a scene where someone wonders ""why would anyone want to kill a little baby?"". Someone will also tell you how ""this is the true damage wrought by communism"". Every environmentalist is a ""tree hugger"" and when he talks about women, sometimes it's like he's just paying lip service to them being smart and capable, like ""she's a great doctor, sure, but she always nags me about my cool smoking"". Or the antagonist in The Sum of All Fears, a careerist who sleeps with the boss to get ahead, and also the nutty environmentalist who helps plot the end of the world. 

It isn't so much that I'm surprised or appalled that someone in a political job would have conservative politics, or that a soldier would use the occasional politically incorrect slur. That's not unrealistic. It's just that throughout all the books, there's this sort of recurring theme where the good guys are... you know, all part of the rich white catholic old-boy network, the bad guys are all the boogeymen from the 80's, communist countries and muslims and Columbia (which kind of was on everyone's radar during the Just Say No era). Inexplicably Clancy does seem to love Saudi Arabia, portrayed as the most reasonable and friendly middle eastern ally.

To his credit, I think he sees himself as progressive, in some areas. Jack Ryan goes on TV to tell people ""don't hate all muslims, because of this on extremist"". His VP is black. He favors nuclear disarmament while simultaneously portraying USA as somewhat crippled by general miltary drawdown. It's just that... often, when you see a kind of cringy bit of casual racism or sexism, it's coming from someone who is unambiguously one of the good guys. 

There's a scene where, after stalled and contentious trade talks, one of the minor diplomats cuts loose from all the formal diplomatic language and rips into one of the Chinese advisors, telling him ""your dicks aren't big enough to get into pissing contest with us"". I thought the author was going for this as being some sort of catalyst for war, an ""oh shit we fucked up"" moment, instead I realized it's just a little wish fulfillment... ""what if we just told them what we REALLY thought"". Jack Ryan compliments him on the comment, later.

Try to imagine John Krasinski delivering this thought from the books, in 2024: ""How could he bring back the ethos of his parents' generation, and a world in which engaged people went to the altar as virgins? Now they were talking about telling kids that homosexual and lesbian sex was okay.""

For me, that stuff is a turnoff, and the politics just get increasingly 'bumper sticker' from book to book. So, I think this is a good place for me to get off the train, since the series is clearly on the decline and later gets taken over by other authors anyway.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ap84k5/growing_up_it_seemed_like_tom_clancy_was/,2024-02-12T19:13:08Z,539,1280,books,It Ends with Us,POST
hrajzl,I read Too Much and Never Enough (Mary Trump's book) and finished it today! [review],"Hey friends! This was my day today- at a mere 250 pages/6 and a half hour audiobook, it didn't take too long for me to finish this! I know some folks were curious so I wanted to share my thoughts!

How do you nurture a sociopath?

If you were not aware, this book is written by Donald Trump's niece Mary. It is a VERY short book, but it is very good and entertaining 100% of the way through.

So let's break down a little bit about what this book is exactly. You aren't going to find any state secrets here. For anyone asking ""Why Didn't Mary speak out earlier"", this is addresses, but this is isn't a political expose. At it's heart, Too Much and Never Enough is a story about an extremely twisted family, that is much about the other Trumps as it is Donald.

Nothing in this book would sway a true believer. Nothing here is going to rock the world of an undecided voter- because this is a book about who the Trumps are as people. We have already seen Trump mock women, non white folks, disabled people. We have seen him do so many evil things. If you don't know who Trump is by now, I don't really know what to say about you. Too Much and Never Enough is this woman's catharsis- its a way for her to release her trauma. Her book chronicles essentially, how she was became disenchanted with her family before 45 ever decided to run for office, how she was disinherited, and where Fred Trump comes into play as a lynchpin at the center of it all.

Mary's father, Fred Trump junior, was an outlier. Not necessary a good man, but a complicated one who had made a number of visible mistakes before she was even born. She describes his dark relationship with his brother, and her father's slow physical and mental decline as he falls out of favor with Fred Senior. Much of this book is really told through her father's eyes, and through the stories he told her before his passing.

Mary's grandfather Fred is also hi lighted as an abuser that gaslit and traumatized his children, saw the evil in his own younger son, and then raised him as an ideal son to take on the family name. Fred Senior's cruelty towards everyone around him, and shady business practices help shaped the monster we now know today as 45.

As for Donald Trump- Mary uses a number of personal and family stories to paint a picture of Trump's youth. Trump's behavior doesn't come out of thin air, and Mary is really able to paint a picture of 45 at his darkest, which started at a much earlier age than some may expect. These personal stories are chilling and callous- often reflecting his relationships with the American people during his four years as president.

You get some interesting little tidbits about ""modern"" behavior from the family as well, from small squabbles to election night anecdotes. Imagine the literary families of Long days Journey Into the Night or Haunting of Hill House. The Trump family in Mary's book is almost laughably literary ""broken wealthy"". The story of the rise and fall of the Trumps plays out like a screenplay. Later on in the book, Mary talks a lot more about contending with Donald and the family personally as she is disinherited. 

I highly recommend Too Much and Never Enough, even if you don't find yourself often drawn towards non fiction- if only because this is a simple and easy to follow biography that helps us understand how we got where we are now. How Donald Trump, against all odds, rose in the ranks of his own family from a younger ""second son"", and ended up making all of us pay for his neurosis.

I think most folks would go into this worried that Mary is providing excuses or sympathy for her family, and I can assure you that is not the case. Mary is an exceptional author and intelligent woman who makes no excuses for her family, and manages to tell a hard and painful story with striking objectivity and honesty.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hrajzl/i_read_too_much_and_never_enough_mary_trumps_book/,2020-07-14T21:35:15Z,357,9620,books,It Ends with Us,POST
jmwr2t,It Can't Happen Here By Sinclair Lewis: Still Relevant Today As It Was Back In 1935,"I've reread It Can't Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis and I must say it's going to stay on my bookshelf till the end of time. I am not an overly political person but if anyone has read it then you might understand how crazy similar it is to today's American society. From things like media manipulation and outright suppression to the rise of militias across the US and much more. You might have heard America is more divided now than it has ever been, in the book that is also very much the scenario but it gets so much worse.  It's almost hard to believe that a book that was published back in 1935 when the world was closely watching what was happening to places like Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan, can still hold so much weight today. 

If you're interested in an alternate reality where America becomes even worse than Nazi Germany, I highly recommend this book because the similarities between its world and ours are terrifying parallel. Although in the book we actually become an outright fascist state while right now we seem to be barely trying not to be. Curious what people think but I'm not trying to start a political debate here, just a discussion on the impact of this book in relation to American society today.

Thanks everyone for the huge response and great  conversations I've got alot to read,watch and learn! Double thanks for the upvotes! I didn't see this happening on this topic. I'll keep that in mind after I come back with some new ideas from all the recommendations!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jmwr2t/it_cant_happen_here_by_sinclair_lewis_still/,2020-11-02T21:33:34Z,136,4620,books,It Ends with Us,POST
c0194g,Anyone read Animorphs? You don't appreciate how dark it is until you are older and can compare it to other books. (Major Spoilers),"I was totally into this book series as a kid. It was really dark when you look back. Though as a kid i just cared about the progression, you really appreciate how dark it was once you look back on it.

&#x200B;

The series had an interesting enough premise. The book was about kids who could use morphing technology to change into different animals to fight off an alien invasion of slug-like aliens. These slugs were waging a silent invasion on earth in order to capture hosts and take over their brains/bodies. They could be inside anyone, even your mom and dad, who are trapped in their own brain as the Yerk inside them plotted on you next.

First... The book was violent and graphic from the start. It featured and was aimed at 13 year olds. Very graphic stories of bodies being torn limb from limb, feeling yourself dying, blood gushing from what was left of your torn body as you slip awayyyy

&#x200B;

But it was so much more then that.  It showed you what can happen in war.

&#x200B;

The kids started off not wanting to be the monsters. They said they wanted to fight them, not become them. But oh, how war can change even a child.  They were 13 when the war started, 16 when it ended.

&#x200B;

At first, they did not want to kill at all.

&#x200B;

Then... They limited it to not killing humans.

&#x200B;

Then it was.  ""We don't kill humans who are running away.""

&#x200B;

Then it was ""We don't kill prisoners""

&#x200B;

Then it was ""We kill all enemies on sight""

&#x200B;

That turned into ""We kill anyone who slows us down, we don't care who they are""

&#x200B;

Then it was ""We do kill prisoners.  In fact, we will black mail you about it"".

&#x200B;

Next. Threats of Mass murder and destruction. Innocents included. Anything or anyone near the target.

&#x200B;

Next. Mass murder and destruction. Innocents included. Anything or anyone near the target.

&#x200B;

Next. Mass murder of helpless prisoners as a distraction. Or.. just because the Animorph leader was having a bad day.

&#x200B;

Next? Send your closest family member to kill your other closest family member. As a distraction. (They both die.)

&#x200B;

Next?  Tell yourself about how you are the good guy, so you would never turn into another human using your morphing powers without their permission.

&#x200B;

Next?  Steal some hospitalized guy's blood from his body so you can use your morphing power to turn into a human without his permission.

&#x200B;

Next?  Woo handicapped children to fight for your guerrilla army. By promising them the power to get out of, and maybe even heal their handicapped bodies, using the morphing process.

&#x200B;

Next? Order the handicapped children to kill a bunch of giant worms. Make the children de-morph exposed in open combat, and flop around helpless in their natural handicapped bodies, in order to turn into dangerous animals to kill almost helpless giant worms who were sentient and mostly slaves themselves, and to themselves.

&#x200B;

Next?  Order the handicapped children to commit suicide via being incinerated one by one. By attacking a powerful flying spaceship as tigers and bears. As a distraction.  (Berate them and peer pressure them when they get scared)

&#x200B;

And lets not forget... Force a ""dog-life-force-giving"" android pacifist with incredible strength and technological ability to assist in killing by threatening to kill as many prisoners as it took.

&#x200B;

Oh... And have most of the main cast most likely die in a suicide attack at the end of the book. Cliff-Hanger.

&#x200B;

(From commentators who refreshed my memory.)

&#x200B;

Also: Convinced a kid to join them as an ally in the war. Trapped him for life as a rat when he could not handle it. Made him beg to die.

&#x200B;

Also: Make allies with a friendly pre-historic earth based alien race. Trick them. Make them go extinct. And take their weapon to save themselves instead.

&#x200B;

Also: Made a kind-hearted pacifist android fall into deep depression by forcing him to live an eternity with the memories of tearing living creatures apart.

....

&#x200B;

Ya...

&#x200B;

The book also discussed numerous social controversies, romance during war, and was a clever read, and made me laugh more then any other book with its humor. It was a heck of a book series.

&#x200B;

Wanted to get to state this book series may have a bit of a ""childish"" writing ideology at the surface, but is a good read, and has great progression of its story and characters. It has a very detailed world. I recommend it.

192oaqu,"“The Maidens” by Alex Michaelides is not as good as “The silent patient”, it was really a disappointment.","

SPOILER!!!


The story seemed to me hastily written and it seems to me that the author decided to write this novel only for money. The main character, Mariana, is one of the most annoying characters possible. In fact, I disliked it so much almost throughout the entire book. I didn't understand the stupid connection the author made between his two books and why the hell he brought Theo Faber into the discussion. It seems to me that the author just tried to serve us a quick story, without a strong base, and with an unexpected ending. Unfortunately, the ending was not at all unexpected for me, because I was convinced that Zoe was guilty and I knew that she had a relationship with Sebastian, but I suspected that Sebastian is not actually dead and that everything was some kind of staging, and he found a corpse that looked like him, because anyway the sea damaged his face. Yes, I know, I went too far with my thoughts, I have a rich imagination😂. What did you guys think about the book?

gvt82y,"Every time I re-read Walden, I get more frustrated about the sheer number of high school english teachers who assign it to impressionable youth without even understanding Thoreau's points.","I've read Walden four times in the last ten years. I re-read it whenever I feel like I need recentering or if I need something to take me out of today's problems (many of them today which caused my fourth re-read) and it upsets and frustrates me thinking of the thousands of high schoolers who graduate every year being unintentionally (or intentionally?) misled about the points Thoreau was trying to make by clueless english teachers.

**This part of my argument is anecdotal**: in all of the english classes in my high school, and even in music history classes at undergrad, teachers and professors so readily dismiss and mock the points they think thoreau is making when in reality it's not what he's arguing. Some examples:

'It's just cabin porn''He tells everyone to be self-reliant then has his mom do his laundry'

'He tells everyone that he lived alone in the woods for three years but he didn't'

'He shit talks college despite having a degree from harvard'

'He just wants everyone to give away all their stuff and hoe beans all day'

I could go on, but I think enough people get my point and remember these sorts of dismissive, snide remarks about Thoreau. The reality is: none of these were points Thoreau was trying to make, and the worst part is that the misunderstood points he was making are actually proving to be the root of the problems of today's society. He has a whole freaking chapter dedicated to talking about visitors, his preface tells people quite clearly that his intention wasn't to go three years without human contact (quarantine is showing all of us this would be unreasonable for us to expect of someone anyway), he let his mother do his laundry because they had a loving relationship and she wanted to help him, and you know why he didn't spend all three years in the cabin? Because he felt that it was unjust to hide in the woods while people were still allowed to own slaves. He left to help fugitive slaves in Concord because Thoreau was also a fervent abolitionist.

So what did Thoreau want? Here are \*my\* five biggest take-aways from reading Walden

1. He wanted people to live more simply. He thinks we get too attached to the 'surface' of things and never question what's beneath which leads to materialism and sensationalist news influencing our world to a negative outcome. Sound familiar?
2. He believed people should spend more time in nature. Not once did he preach that we should all go live like animals forever and eschew society - he argued that people would benefit from living in nature fronting only the bare essentials of life so they may return to society as better, more sensitized people. Living with nature, we see what matters and what's important \*cough\* climate change\* cough\*
3. He believed education needed reform and rethinking as its the most important part of a child's development. He believed retreating to nature for truth was the most direct route to de-colonizing and that educating the youth in nature and village rather than schoolhouse and university was the most wholesome way to teach children to think for themselves and be liberated from capitalism’s death-grip on the educational system. Maybe this is why high school teachers tell us all to think he's a quack because of the reality that the educational system has some pretty glaring weaknesses?
4. He wanted everyone to speak truthfully. ""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth"" he didn't want frivolties - he wanted everyone to only speak with sincerity and from the heart. He didn't want to hear about news from Texas while talking to someone in Concord, he wanted to hear what someone's dreams and ambitions were and he wanted all of us to embody the truth and honesty in life rather than the gilded edges.
5. He believed the way our economy was set up kept downtrodden people on the bottom without time to better themselves, because if people on the bottom had the time to learn how to better themselves then the whole system would collapse resulting in a better world. Same argument is used today: the bottom percent is unable to get our of the bottom percent, so bad people stay in power and good people stay in submission because they need money to pay bills.

My point here is not to have everyone drop what they're doing and read Walden or get a Thoreau bust to kiss every morning. My point here is that I really \*really\* dislike the way Walden is taught to impressionable youth. I have friends from all over the country who have had similar experiences with Walden in high school, then I get them to read it again in their 20s, and they get similarly frustrated with how their teachers mishandled his book as a way to shit talk breaking away from capitalism and the less-rosy parts of modern life as something for nutjobs.

The reality is that we need Thoreau's ideas now more than ever. If we had listened to Thoreau, maybe life wouldn't be shit wall-to-wall in America right now. He was against authoritarianism, he was against rampant industrialization for the sake of industrialization (""If everyone lives a simpler life then who will build the railroads?! \[paraphrased\]), he was a firm believer in living with nature, and he was a firm believer that living a simpler, literature and nature- based lifestyle would lead to a healthier society.

You can think I'm a quack too if you want, but Thoreau was right about almost everything and today we suffer the consequences of decades of high school teachers teaching Walden to our youth without even understanding the point of it. I would like to end with a great quote from Walden.

“I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.”

I want you to tell me who needs to hear this more than a room full of teenagers. But please, let's keep telling our youth that Thoreau the abolitionist and environmentalist was full of shit.

Update: hold your keyboard if you're going to accuse me of generalizing english teachers, you're just gonna make yourself look like a chucklehead. Who should I blame for Walden being mis-taught? The math teachers?

xz5bho,I just finished Anna Karenina! It was beyond beautiful. I don't know what to do with myself.,"Hello!

As the title says, I'm currently absolutely smitten with Leo Tolstoy's *Anna Karenina* and both in awe at how I've managed to go through all these years without reading it whilst also feeling glad that I ""saved it up"" until now and enjoyed it for the first time only recently.

I don't think there's a novel with its scope, even Dostoyevsky whom I used to consider a genius of the human spirit (and still do) does not reach so far. Tolstoy encompasses every possible dynamic between human beings of different backgrounds, sufferings, desires, resentments, with different relations to each other, with his sharp eye and wisdom he captures those delicate nuances of human thought, behaviour and interactions; lonely wives, lost men, neglected children, the peasantry, the nobility, mistresses, joys and pains and hope all merge in one wonderful kaleidoscopic tapestry that paints not just Russia, but the world and Man as a whole.

I teared up multiple times throughout, sometimes from melancholy but often from genuine pure joy or being affected by these characters as if they were a part of me, in anticipation and in love I cried for those people knowing that they are not entirely fictional but some of the most accurate depictions of human beings around us that has ever existed in literature.

Mostly I am pleasantly surprised by my own changing feelings towards Anna, still so intrigued, fascinated and troubled by the way this charming, sweet, dignified woman we met on the train turned into a shrill, selfish, bitter and unrecognisable person by the end who was grasping with her entire being both to keep whatever she has left and destroy it all in an act of desperate madness. For the entire novel after her affair I could not sympathise with her, as she went about everything in ways that seemed less like ""I don't have a choice, I feel trapped"" and more purposely cruel, especially in her dealings with Alexei Alexandrovich. But after the novel ended, and for a brief period beforehand, when the pace was becoming anxious and she was racing towards a climatic destruction of any possible reconciliation or the chance of redemption through a happy life with Vronsky, I felt such sudden care for her well-being and a deep sadness at her fate. I was tormented by what happened to her even if I couldn't stand her throughout the story, someone on quora mentioned something about how that's the whole consistency of her character- everyone loves Anna! No matter how much pain she causes or how objectively self-centred she is, you can't help but feel sorry at the end, and to wonder why she did all of this less reproachingly but with genuine pity. I suppose we are in the place of her husband in that way, who at first loathed her then couldn't help but forgive. It's astounding. I'm curious as to how others feel about her! 

&#x200B;

Lastly, Levin and Kitty have my whole heart :')",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xz5bho/i_just_finished_anna_karenina_it_was_beyond/,2022-10-08T22:22:01Z,87,644,books,It Ends with Us,POST
15rxonh,I finally read Kiki's Delivery Service and it was really great!!,"spoiler warning 

The story is about KiKi and her black cat, JiJi, interacting with various people in Koriko Town. The first five books is about how Kiki growing from 13 to 20 years old.

According to tradition, witches will leave home for a year after turning 13, using magic to help people, showing the world that magic still exists. The protagonist, Kiki, after leaving home, she settles in Koriko Town and starts working as a delivery witch.

Despite being a witch and an optimistic person, she's still a 13 year old child. She feels self-abasement when she sees children who are prettier, gets jealous of more popular witches, and becomes frustrated when her crush doesn't notice her. She struggles with challenging tasks from customers, desires pretty clothes even though witches only wear black, and over pride when praised, end up leading to trouble, and when she encounters the concept of death, she's not even fully understanding it.

We all have these experiences when we were young, while Kiki go through these experiences, also reminding us our innocent selves. back when we were once as naive and adorable as Kiki.

As Kiki went from 13 to 20. We can feel her growth. She becomes less concerned about appearances, feels happy for others' happiness, becomes adaptable when faced with challenges, and learns to confront death. Most importantly, she falls in love or finally grasps her feelings of love. She develops feelings for a boy, and the fifth episode ends after their confession.

In the sixth book, 15 years pass. Once our neighbor's little sister, Kiki has become Miss Kiki next door. Now have two children, and the story went from being about Witch Kiki to being about Kiki's family. 

Though her daughter inherits the witch's blood, she's unsure about becoming a witch. Her son, while desiring to become one, lacks of magic, he doesn't know what he should do. At the story's end, they leave together on their 13th birthday. The sister finally decides to become a witch and flies away on a broom, while the brother leaves for a self finding journey.

The ending is somewhat open-ended. The brother previously encountered a supernatural creature in the forest, and on the train, he and his cat companion feel the same thing again. I guess the author wants to tell us that even without magic, exciting adventures still await him.

The story concludes here.

In fact, having read the entire story, you'll notice that it revolves around four themes: ""Discovery,"" ""Courage,"" ""Growth,"" and ""Separation."" 

I believe the author wants to tell us that whether it's Kiki, her children, or us, as long as we're alive, we will continue to make new discoveries. We should summon the courage to face life's challenges. Once we overcome obstacles, we'll growing into a better self. Eventually, we and those around us wont be together forever. Therefore, while we still have time, we should cherish the moments spent together.

v50t1x,"I finished The Stand for the first time last night, and it was every bit as good as people said","For those who don't know, *The Stand* is about a virus developed by the US military that kills off 99% of the world's population, and it covers everything from patient zero to the crumbling and rebirth of modern civilization. Ultimately, it is a story of good vs evil with supernatural/religious themes and a moral of ""weapons are bad"".

I was impressed with the character development and how many different personality types were represented. The wishful thinker, the brooding incel, the blue-collar worker, the philosopher, the narcissist, the reluctant leader and the apprehensive follower; almost anyone who reads this book can relate to one or more of the characters. The world-building was equally good, and the length of the uncut edition thoroughly conveyed the length of their journey.

Some people don't like the ending because they think it fizzles out, but I see it as life simply moving on. Once the bad guy has been defeated and civilization starts making a comeback, what more is there to tell?

I've been a fan of Stephen King for most of my life and have always heard how good *The Stand* is, but I put it off for years due to it being much longer than my attention span used to be.

10y6j9q,I finished Never Let Me Go by Ishiguro today and I am in absolute love with it,"I was suggested to read *Never Let Me Go (NLMG)* by someone in Waterstone’s whilst I was searching for a book to read. Having informed her that I had read and studied Ishiguro’s *Remains of the Day* this was the one that she informed I should read. I didn’t ask for her info so if she is reading this, thank you for the suggestion. 

Right from the get go, I could tell the book was going to be told almost as a diary or a memoir esque type of story telling. Having read the blurb first and the first page I could tell I would connect with Kathy H. what with us being of similar age even if the story is set in 1990. And that’s what makes the story telling absolutely gripping. However, the twist at the end was absolute unexpected and therefore tore my insides and made me feel as though I was inside an industrial shredder. 

Whilst reading it, I thought Hailsham was a respite center for kids suffering from cancer. Then as I read on I thought it was a school for children with cancer and that’s why they were exchanging projects. It was until I read Miss Lucy’s section where I got confused and wondered why they were going to be donors for giving their organs. I thought I’ll be told at the end what all the donor things meant. 

That it was written blasé and sounded “boring” I feel like was the point. The whole story read as though it was a matter of fact and made the plot somewhat true to life; in a *shit happens, get up and get on with it*. 

I was siding with Kathy but Tommy made me switch to be his wingman. That he was made fun of for his (lack of) artistic skills and his sport participation made me also connect with him. It was emotional when his art was suddenly (at The Cottages(?)) absolutely incredible. I was pulling for him from then. 

The >!reveal of them being clones for organ donation the human population!< was somewhat unexpected. My jaw damn near hit the floor. I finished this book at work and was an absolutely emotional wreck. Hook, line, and sinker; if Ishiguro’s intention was to make readers think about how precious life is and how everyone in your life (including yourself) will one day cease to exist then he got me. 

It made me question my own morals and purpose. Am I a kind person? What ill effect am I having on others if any? Who will remember me once I pass? Will I remember others who are in my life and have passed? Will I even remember who they were if they pass? 

It’s an absolutely emotionally gritty reflection of life in and of itself. I’m happily giving it a 5/5. I am still not over >!all the death of everyone at the school. Tommy’s hit me the most though. It’s so sad.!<

The staff member at another Waterstone’s suggested I read *American Psycho* after I finish *NLMG* but if you think I should read something else that is far better please let me know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10y6j9q/i_finished_never_let_me_go_by_ishiguro_today_and/,2023-02-09T21:19:25Z,125,555,books,It Ends with Us,POST

King goes into so much detail with Jack's thoughts and his genuine love for Danny after the incident with the arm. You can truly forgive Jack and want see past his many faults.

17c2rfd,"Have you ever read a book which you deeply disliked by the end, only for it to become a favorite after you properly digested it?","That was Blindsight for me. By the time I read the last paragraph and closed the book, I honestly hated it. Now, here's the thing, I did finish reading it. I am by no means a completionist, I'll abandon books at the first hint of annoyance, so I guess Blindsight never annoyed me, it just told me things I didn't want to hear, but which were still interesting. The really alien aliens helped a lot. But yeah, by the end I was so against the book's premise, >!that self awareness is an expensive glitch which has only survived in humans accidentally and most successful species out there don't bother with it!<, that I felt kind of angry at Peter Watts and kept trying to argue with him in my head. I spent weeks, probably, trying to think of ways to disprove that book's core ideas. And I hated Sarasti so much. And I felt to identified with Siri and thought he could do no wrong and was my golden boy.  

And maybe because of all that thinking about the book, slowly I came around. I realized that premise was actually genius, and a wonderful cosmic horror concept.

n66oy4,Criticising the formats other people read in is ableist - can we maybe stop it please?,"There are quite a few people on here that are highly critical of audiobook listeners and recently, ebook readers.

This is honestly not something I'd even come across in bookish spaces before this sub. The folks on r/fantasy seem to worship the ground audiobooks walk on, r/suggestmeabook don't seem to care as long as you're reading the classics, and my smaller bookish groups frequently engage in discussions over specific audiobook narrators. 

A lot of people like audiobooks because they just like audiobooks. Which is great - they're enjoying themselves. Same for ebooks - some people just like them, or they move houses a lot and can't be dealing with carting a whole library with them (hello fellow students). For a lot of people though, it's not a matter of convenience, it's a matter of accessibility. 

 Storytime - around six months ago, my migraines made the jump from frequent episodic to chronic. Chronic migraines means you have headaches for at least 15 days a month. When I have a migraine, I'm bed bound - light hurts, movement hurts, I get brainfog and can't think straight. Reading with my eyes is out of the question, particularly the kinds of fantasy epics I really love. I spend around half my time like this. It really sucks. Audiobooks are the only way I can read when I'm like this, and to be completely honest, having a distraction is the only way I can cope with constantly being in pain.

Beyond my own personal experience, I know numerous people who wouldn't be reading at all if it weren't for audiobooks. Friends with dyslexia, sight loss, mental health issues that impact concentration, and a million other reasons why physical reading wouldn't otherwise be accessible. 

E-readers similarly have accessibility benefits. The most obvious being the ability to change text size, font,  and even the colour you read in. I love times new roman, but I know a lot of dyslexic people who really appreciate being able to change it to a font they find easier such as open dyslexic. Beyond that, e-readers are physically much easier to handle, especially if you're into big chonky fantasy epics like me. Also, ebooks are *much* easier to get a hold of for people in countries where shipping is unreliable, or physical books are prohibitively expensive. 

 At the end of the day, not everyone is going to be able to read using the same format. I'm sure there are many, many people out there that are only able to read print books for accessibility reasons. How about we all just stop criticising people that read in different ways to us, stop saying that certain types of reading are 'inferior', and move on with our lives? After all, more people being able to read is a good thing - that means there's more people to talk about your favourite books with!

yjsopy,I just finished It Started With Us and wanted to see for those that read it what they thought?,"Me? I enjoyed the two different views. Aka Lily and Atlas. I was happy to see they got their happy ending. Adding in Josh was a nice touch. I’m happy Lily stood up against Ryle with Aylssa and Marshall who surprised me when they all sat down n had their talk.

From me personally I’ve dealt with a toxic relationship and didn’t really have that support system. I suffered in silence and then I got to my breaking point and packed my stuff and left. Seeing Lily going thro it while pregnant I couldn’t imagine 😩. I’d been hella scared and going back to Ryle definitely would’ve been something I’d have stubbles with myself. But seeing shortly after that Atlas came into the picture and showed her the love she needed 🥺 
    I liked the touch of Josh as well. Having the story of Atlas coming from into life and seeing him struggling as well. Seeing Lily and Atlas still getting to be with each other while also but struggling. Showing no one’s life is perfect and cut in stone. It’s not black and white. 

     The only thing I didn’t like where the journals tbh. In It started with us they were cute and not super long. Where as in It Ends with us they were lengthy and (I know she was young when writing in these journals) but childish 😅 like I get the author was portraying the characters age in the journals but I had to fight so hard to not skimmed them personally. 
      Overall I loved both books and they definitely helped me stand my ground against my ex and finally move on and not guilt trip me anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yjsopy/i_just_finished_it_started_with_us_and_wanted_to/,2022-11-02T02:15:04Z,1,2,books,It Ends with Us,POST
15vwwut,Finally got around to reading Where the Crawdads Sing and have no one to discuss it with,"That's right, reddit, much like the poor Marsh Girl, I am all alone in this world and am here to cast my grits onto the beach for all the gulls to eat (I am off work and making a reddit post and hoping someone will indulge me). So, I am not the most well-read person and have been getting really into reading ever since I took up a career in which I find myself frequently living in the outdoors without power, wifi, amenities, etc. (see, I told you I'm just like Kya). 

It is probably more of a ""beach read,"" which is certainly what I used it for. It was a great way to unwind at the end of the day. I do agree with some other reviews that I've seen that state the entire plot is highly implausible, but personally, I find myself to be someone who can and will suspend disbelief easily. Oh, it's impossible for a little girl to grow up completely alone, somehow evading all care and end up not (that) mentally ill and even highly intelligent? I don't care, it's a book I would read for fun. Also, complaints that her teeth would be falling out, etc., have an imagination; she probably picked up dental hygiene along the way, but that wasn't necessary to the story. Criticisms like that are a little silly to me. I do think they are fair. But it isn't a complaint that resonates with me. 

Now, criticisms that do resonate with me that I want to talk about. First and foremost, race. Throughout the book, I found it interesting that it absolutely had to be mentioned when a character was Black. There were times it was warranted and I don't want to live in a color-blind world. If it is relevant, don't be afraid to say it. But then, also maybe mention when people are white, or don't just randomly write ""there was a man on the street WHO WAS BLACK."" Obviously, that is for exaggeration, but it really came to feel like that. 

And why does every Black character speak like a white lady reciting ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" from memory? As many others have said, it was cringe and frankly, borders on minstrel. And why did Jumpin's wife have huge boobs that were talked about more than once? Is the only Black woman Delia Owens has ever seen from Gone with the Wind? I don't think the Black characters were as caricature-y as they could've been, but that isn't a compliment obviously. It made sense that a Black family would feel some sympathy or kinship with another social outcast, but there is a lot of nuances that clearly didn't make it into the book. The Black characters existed only to help Kya along and be kind to her. And what did she ever do in return? 

That is my most glaring criticism of the book and the only reason I would be very hesitant to recommend the book to anyone else. My feeling on many things like this is that I wouldn't necessarily stop others from reading it, but I would preface it with a discussion on why it is problematic and let someone see for themselves, of course barring some extreme cases. I think everything is worth seeing/reading, at least for educational purposes. But also, just read more books by BIPOC authors.

My other glaring criticism is the sudden, almost bizarre reveal at the end. Once the red hat was revealed to be in Kya's possession, I really had no doubts that she did it, but the sudden reveal on the final page left me feeling very strange. So, Kya was a bad person? Or a complicated one? Or I should feel bad for her? Or it was an act of revenge/justice? It leaves a bad taste in the reader's mouth, which on the one hand, I do commend. I did like that the protagonist was suddenly corrupt with no real path to redemption. But I also wish we'd seen more of it. We really didn't get great insight into Kya other than her intense loneliness, which was something I did like about the book and could relate to. But I ultimately couldn't figure her out. 

She really worked best when she wasn't speaking. When she had long bits of dialogue I found myself wondering, who is this? She wasn't fleshed out enough for her monologues to seem warranted. It felt like reading two different characters. I think she could've been such a rich, complex, deeply flawed character and I wish Owens had leaned into that. I also wish Owens could have found a reason for why Kya was who she was other than her glaring abandonment issues. Imagine if the book investigated the idea of Kya is malicious, partly because of where she's from, but also because it's just something in her, and in all of us. This theme does appear briefly, of course, most obviously at the end, but I think it really could've been explored more deeply. At times, the character reads like one many of us wannabe authors have written in our young age, the perfect mysterious girl we secretly want to be (ah, so many high school ""novels"" and short stories I wrote). Like, okay, we get it, she is *so* skinny and *so* pretty, can you also give us some deeper insight into why she suddenly decided to kill her ex and how premeditated it was, etc. We got some crumbs and can use our imaginations, but the book really would've been more fun if it had this layer of complexity.

Also, Kya seems to clearly be a self-insert. Which I guess I don't really have a problem with if it's well done. Discovering Owens herself is wanted in connection to the mysterious death of a poacher in Zambia and describing herself as having endured the same ""name-calling"" as Kya puts a lot of the novel into perspective. I am someone who often can separate art from the artist (while still acknowledging wrongdoing), but when an author clearly doesn't explore their character more deeply because they don't want to air out all their personal dirty laundry, I do have a problem. Also, what is this then? A confession?? It is bizarre that she made Kya a murderer who got away with it and makes it out to be some kind of justice. Yikes. There is a lot to Delia Owens' background that makes me like the book less, which is always disappointing. 

Overall, I don't regret reading it. I enjoyed it. The descriptions of nature were always captivating to me (although, as I've seen others ask, where the hell are the mosquitos?! This girl would've been swarmed daily). I enjoyed the look into loneliness, isolation, first love and heartbreak. There was some great stuff going on in this book. But there also were some glaring issues, particularly in the way its Black characters were treated, which considering the book came out so recently is frustrating and disappointing. And I take issue with the poor characterization of its protagonist. 

If you read any of this, thank you! I just had so many thoughts and as I said, not many people to share them with, so I just wanted to shout into the void of reddit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15vwwut/finally_got_around_to_reading_where_the_crawdads/,2023-08-20T00:49:47Z,45,81,books,It Ends with Us,POST
11pj5qw,"Rock Paper Scissors by Alice Feeney - it shouldn't work, but somehow it does!","I've read all of her books, I'm still not sure which one is my favorite, but Rock Paper Scissors is definitely the least fucked up!  😅 I'm usually not a fan of a book with so few characters because in a thriller the killers/twists are always obvious and not surprising, but this was done well (unlike Survive the Night by Riley Sager...)

As soon as the letters were introduced, I had a suspicion >!it wasn't really the wife, but after a few chapters I was like, ""hmmm, I think it is the wife""  😀 So I was surprised by the twist it was actually Robin, and he was her first wife!!<

I got a weird vibe about >!Amelia in the first few chapters!<!

Alice Feeney did such a good job about bringing the work friend in,>! I at first thought she would end up sleeping with the wife, but then it was obvious Adam was going to sleep with her in a mix-up. So, do you think Adam actually thought Amelia was Robin?!<

Even with so few characters, I was completely surprised>! Amelia knew Adam as a child, and was behind the car! But I thought the final twist of Adam driving was so stupid lol. I'm pretending it was still Amelia.!<

I have to attempt I speed read it because I was so worried something bad would happen to sweet Bob! >!But when Robin was revealed I relaxed lol!<

I thought it was a cop-out at the end>! that Robin and Adam got back together, but honestly I wasn't super mad about it lol!<

I didn't get:>! Why were both Amelia and Adam acting like they were planning on killing the other one during the stay? Did I misunderstand it? What was the point of the final chapter with Samuel? !<

I will re-read, especially now that I know the twists.

It kind of reminded me of >!The Wife Between Us!<, but TW:>! there is a doggy in it and it goes missing.!<",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11pj5qw/rock_paper_scissors_by_alice_feeney_it_shouldnt/,2023-03-12T16:46:08Z,17,17,books,It Ends with Us,POST
opy3zn,Just finished Mother Night by Vonnegut and it may be my favorite book of his so far!,"The writing, story, characters, and all of it were great. Using Campbell as a way to explore the human individual and human groups was genius. I’ve also been reading Albert Camus’s Committed Writings which includes a couple of his essays, ‘Letters to a German Friend’ and ‘Reflections of the Guillotine.’ 

The parallels between these two essays and Mother Night are super interesting and only add to it all. They both have themes of anti-nationalism, the good and corruption of people as an individual and a society/country, and the overall state of the world. The craziest part of it is seeing how relevant these essays and books are to our world today. 

I know a common thing to do with Mother Night is discuss whether you think Campbell was guilty or not. I don’t think he was. While he may have had some personal guilt, I think the powers that be (US government in this case) were largely responsible for the people that were victims of his propaganda and for putting Campbell through what he did.

While he was seemingly indifferent towards either side of the war, he was a spy for the US and working towards their goals. As he says, he didn’t do it out of patriotism or anything of the sort. More so out of just being pushed along in life. He talks about how he made his propaganda so ridiculous and crazy intentionally, hoping that the people he was targeting would never believe it. 

As indifferent as he comes across, it does seem that he did find himself somewhat guilty, at least in a personal sense. He talks of having to teach and convince himself not to feel guilt and then the book ends, well, how it ends. After realizing the converting effect he had on people, even years later, and coming to grips with it, it would be hard not to have any personal guilt. I think a better question is, should he personally feel guilty and/or remorseful about what he did? 

This will definitely be one to reread.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/opy3zn/just_finished_mother_night_by_vonnegut_and_it_may/,2021-07-23T08:28:47Z,12,23,books,It Ends with Us,POST
195mle4,Neither of my friends read (or listen to) books because because it takes too much effort. It makes me sad :(,"""N"" we'll call him. Can grind on elden ring multiple times and remember EVERY story route that he took, while also playing several other games doing the same thing.
He is very adamant about not reading, listening to, or looking at anything that isn't manga.

He reads manga only, even though i still consider that a book, i wish he was more interested in other types of books at all.
Today i tried to tell him about an audio book i listened to and he, as polite as he could, basically said that he was bored with the conversation because he wouldn't listen to it anyway.
I twisted it to a funny conversation about how the ""dramatized"" version triggered a cringe-trauma and didn't take offense.

Now ""P"", he has said before that he ""had adhd"" but doesn't anymore, i'm pretty sure thats not how it works, he is a bit of a fibber. (Pretty sure that was the most obvious truth he has told lmao)
He has zero attention span, zero desire to do anything that isn't football, and ONLY reads webbtoonz.
Specifically.
He also obviously has some of the gaming traits of N, but tbh i think N is a future game developer with how in depth he obsesses over games lol.

I haven't read a lot in my life, but books that i have started and enjoyed have left a huge impact on me.
Recently i started an audio book series on audible (for free with the trial) called The Murderbot Diaries.
Apparently i have typed that series name enough that it auto fills.
As you can tell i really like it.
I have read another series called the Night Angel trilogy. (Again auto filled lmao)

I want to share it with my friends but they aren't interested because they don't feel like listening/reading anything that isn't manga/manga like.
I love my friends so much, it just makes me sad.

P seemed a bit more interested once i showed a pic of the night angel trilogy grafic novel, but nothing has come of it intrest wise.



Edit:  Apparently, a single reddit post where i obviously am that i am leaving out some information out of respect for my friends shows exactly how we interact on a daily basis lol.
No, my friends aren't rude. No, i am not bringing it up 24/7 and have brought up individual stories before without saying it is a book with no issues.

Aside from some of the accessive comments, i did think some of them were helpful.
For my friend N, after talking with my mom about it, he may have some kind of embarrassment over reading because he thinks it is for ""smart"" people, and that he isn't smart.
From things he has told us about his personal life, that would make a lot of sense if that is why.

For my friend P, i'm pretty sure untreated adhd can make it very difficult to read. If you knew him, you would agree with me lol.

Someone in the coments said that someone they know has Aphantasia. Yes, i did copy-paste that word.
My mom seems to have that, and it makes it so difficult to read books. She says that it's like reading a long list of instructions with no end. If they both have some kind of issue like that, it would explain why they prefer manga and comics over word only books.
Tbh i think it's more likely with my friend N.
P with his adhd self is difficult to gauge what is him being adhd and what is him not actually understanding what you're saying.

For P, i'm going to see if i can find grafic novel versions of the books i have found that have themes that he likes and see if he likes those.

For N, i'm going to try to find some books that remind me of cyberpunk 2077 or other games he has inhaled knowledge of. If a bigger content creator has talked about it the better. 
He has said before that he never tries games or anime that no one has posted much about because it's not worth his time. I'm guessing because there's less fan content if it's not popular.

I'm going to look into more book content creators that are popular to see if there's a video of them geeking out over a book.

Some books that i found so far that i'm going to check out is Neuromancer and Dungeon Crawler Carl.
My dad was an ABSOLUTE fanboy of Stephen King, so i might be able to get some of that genetic knowledge and find something N would like 😂. He finds the stories about my dad awesome. I'm sure my nerdy ass dad would have already had him hooked on at least one series of King's.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/195mle4/neither_of_my_friends_read_or_listen_to_books/,2024-01-13T12:06:37Z,76,0,books,It Ends with Us,POST
1331pwz,"Just finished The Border Trilogy by Cormac McCarthy.

yd24un,IT STARTS WITH US (Honest Review),"It didn't actually live up to my expectations. It left me with a ""that's it?"" feeling. Maybe because it isn't as deep as IEWU, maybe because it didn't leave me heartbroken this time. BUT, it only made sense to me what *It Starts With Us* actually means several minutes after I read the book.

It's not actually about Lily and Atlas. It's about Atlas and Josh.

It's about how Atlas has to stand up for his brother and take him away from an *abusive* household (Josh's parents) so that he will grow up knowing what love is. So that he won't have an awful teenage life. It's about how Josh's family tree, which has two seedlings for him and Atlas. It starts with them.

To be honest, I think I cried more about Atlas and Josh's story rather than the whole drama Lily and Atlas are facing together. I am somehow disappointed with how fast things transpired between them. I know it's been a year already since Lily and Ryle divorced, but I don't think it is the right time yet for them to be in the relationship. Yes, I am one of the readers looking forward to their journey together, yes they've waited for so long, but I honestly think that it would feel better if things between Lily and Ryle have been settled. I don't mean redemption from Ryle, but I guess I would want to see him be better, at least for his daughter. I honestly thought he would be in therapy already in this book, but I guess Colleen gave us a more realistic view of an abusive person.

kt3e38,Is it just me or is 'The Lord of the Rings' full of thinly veiled racism?,"I should qualify this by saying that overall this is shaping up to be one of my favorite novels period, even though I walked into it already knowing the story beat by beat from having watched and rewatched the movies countless times.

Something that stands out though is how all the good and 'honourable' peoples (not individuals but peoples) are described as having fair or pale skin and often also golden hair and bright eyes. On the other hand, people like the Easterlings and the Haradrim, who are dark or bronze skinned, are repeatedly described as 'wild', 'cruel', or 'terrible'. And these end up being the people who join forces with the Dark Lord. 

There are a bunch of examples but the one that really made me cringe a little was a quote from Faramir, ""And we love \[the people of Rohan\]: tall men and fair women, valiant both alike, golden-haired, bright-eyed, and strong; they remind us of the youth of Men, as they were in the Elder Days.""

170hsk3,"If you haven’t read don casmurro by machado de assis, please do yourself a favour and read it","The book has been written like a first person memoir narrated by bentinho santiago or as his friends call him “don casmurro” aka “sir grumpy”.

Story starts from when teenage bentinho realize that he is totally in love with his friend and neighbour capitu and from there we follow him  through the years as he marries capitu, finds a best friend in escobar, becomes a father and feel like the happiest man the world right before his life crashing down right infront of his eyes.

Story is simple but not boring, writing style is quite humorous, especially in parts where old bentinho’s grumpiness comes out. But what makes this book imo especial is that it does an amazing job of showing us unreliablity of bentinho as narrator. Throughout the book he forgets things, confuses stuff and some times even outright lies. Without spoiling(if spoiler even matters for a book published more that two hundred years ago) something happens near the end where depending on your interpretation of it bentinho can comes across as a tragic figure betrayed by those closest to him or a cruel man that made his and his loved one’s life miserable just because he couldn’t let go of his jealousy.

236vt4,"My incredible grand dad is 69 today. To celebrate, here is a story from one of his books, translated into English for the first time. By me. The War Will Finish On Wednesday. I hope I do it justice & that Reddit enjoys it. :)","He has lived an amazing life, which would make an epic adventure book - I kid you not - but amongst the most noteworthy, and I guess what made him famous - as well as controversial - were the 4 years he spent at the Afghan War, as a political correspondent for the Central Television of the then USSR.  
To put it simply, that war was a tragedy of both national and international scale but also a deeply personal hell that touched a great many families throughout that war. It ravaged the USSR and many of its people, just like it ravaged Afghanistan and fuelled fires of hate, extremism and division that still burn to this day. There were a great many things that separated politics and personal perceptions at that time and immediately afterwards, and it remains a conflicted and painful subject for very many Russians to this day.
None of this, in my opinion, diminishes his work; he had unprecedented access to the Army, was included on many military operations and reported, literally, from the front lines. As well as his detractors, he has many, many friends from that era, not least the ex President of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, who was so instrumental in negotiating the rescue of some of the hostages in Beslan (again, amongst the roll call of greatness that is his life) and is at a restaurant table right now, with my Grand Pap, lifting rounds of vodka to help him celebrate. Na zdorovie!

He has published a great many things in his lifetime and after he came back from that war, alongside my Grandma who worked the entire time by his side as the cultural correspondent from Kabul, they returned with a huge archive of stuff that, due to censorship, was never to be seen. A few years after their return, the dacha caught fire due to some faulty electrics on the neighbour's side (!?) and the entire archive perished. 
Something I'd love to do is get his work to be seen and published in English - so I guess this is the first step towards that end!

 I'm graduating from lurker with this post - so, please, be gentle... and I am looking forward to what y'all are going to have to say about it :). If I've unintentionally ignored some sort of Reddiquette, I am guessing you guys will let me know...Here goes!

	The War Will Finish on Wednesday
by Mikhail Leshchinsky
 EDIT: SOME PICTURES FROM THAT TIME HERE:
http://manelli.imgur.com/all/
Yes, yes, everyone knew it with certainty, knew it even as far back as 10 months prior to that very Wednesday - 15 February 1989. 
In retrospect the reason was simple: by this date, set by mutual agreement between the USA and the USSR, every last one of our soldiers had to have left the country.

And so it was the last Monday before that fateful Wednesday. A day, remarkably warm and sunny even for an Afghan February.
In the almost deserted AFSOR settlement on the banks of the Amu Darya River, there were less than 10 of us in total.

AFSOR was the largest outpost of the Soviet-Afghan Action Transport Company. The outpost – two dozen small, Finnish looking chalets. And us - we were the correspondents of The Central USSR Broadcasting Television in Afghanistan; Boris Romanenko and me, Artem Borovik - a journalist from Moscow and our military driver Serezha, designated to us with his Soviet made jeep for the duration of the evacuation.
This little group had only formed the evening prior, having arrived to the bordering city of Hairaton together with the last column of our troops. At that time it consisted only of General Gromov's detail and his protection unit. This was the battalion set to officially mark the exit of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, even though by this time almost the entire army had withdrawn and we were already on the other side of the river.

During that last month we were forced to constantly shuttle back and forth across the border with the retreating troops, televising reports from Termez to Moscow only to return towards the ever advancing columns of soldiers to complete the journey with them once more.

Of course, this was not an easy time –much like the rest of the 4 years spent by me at that war. Imagine: with yet another section of the troops we cross the border- flags flying, soldiers marching, military meetings, the joy of family reunions, the palpable happiness at having survived...We taped it all, passing the reports to the Vremia television program back home, only to turn around once more to cross the border, where anything was still possible - where there remained a continued assault on our retreating troops, where mines were still exploding, there was heavy shelling and we were under fire not just from the “Ghosts” – (name given to Afghan fighters in Soviet media), but also those who we considered as allies only yesterday...

It all hit the nerves hard; but there were also a lot of positive emotions. For us, it was only too easy to picture the hunger with which the country watched our reports from the battlefields, with how much happiness and relief people glimpsed on screen the beloved faces of their relatives, following day after day their slow return home, to life.

Many of the soldiers' families gathered in Termez. They would wait for days for their children, standing right by the border, never knowing even approximately, when the meeting would happen and whether it would happen here or even at all. Not a single official then bothered or thought to let people know which regiment, and when, will be crossing the border. For these parents, running desperately from solider to soldier we were the only link to those still crossing the ice covered mountains, still serving on blockaded roads, still freezing on post in frost covered tanks and military vehicles. To this day, I still have kept many scraps of paper, with hastily, tremblingly scribbled numbers of divisions, field posts, names. ""If you meet him, please tell him we are here, we will be waiting at Termez"" - they implored. And we did, in fact, often meet people, sought them out deliberately, went out of our way to find and film with our cameras those dear faces, so eagerly awaited back home, on the banks of that God forsaken river, which still separated war and peace.

And so, it was a warm, sunny Monday....Having seen off the last remaining battalion on the previous day, that morning saw us we eagerly conducting our own extensive preparations to return. 

Thoroughly washed uniforms and other bits of clothing were flapping on the laundry lines left strung up between cottages by their previous owners.

But we still had two long nights ahead of us. And, judging by the events of the prior night, we were not expecting for them to be peaceful. As darkness enveloped the shore of Amu Darya, pandemonium would break out. Out of bitter hatred towards us and a fear of the mujahideen, who had already approached the city behind our receding backs, Afghan soldiers mercilessly shelled the post from every type of weapon. 

Fires burned all around and munition stocks exploded as our soldiers detonated the last of their supplies before taking the final trip across the border. Let’s say that it was definitely not dull.

All these years later, there still remains an especially bitter, painful memory - the fate of our mine dogs. 
At war, these dogs are very special; precious. Thoroughly, painstakingly trained, they lead the way ahead of mine disposal experts, relying only upon their nose. How many of their soldiers' lives they have saved. And, devoid of any protection themselves, they would often detonate mines in the process, suffered heavy contusions and injuries. But they were always cherished, left behind at various posts to heal and to be nursed, fed whatever provisions available, even when it often meant depriving yourself.

Together with their soldiers, they were also returning from duty, from the war. My operator managed to capture an incredibly powerful shot in those days, on the high mountain crossing at Salang. Our troops were conquering that peak in temperatures of -20 C. And there, on top of one of the tanks, between two manholes, sat an Alsatian entirely white with frost. Neither the fierce wind, nor the freezing cold could force her to retreat inside the vehicle; she was on duty, she was guarding her people, her post.

These very real friends, these comrades of the front who had saved our lives again and again, had to be left on the Afghan side of the border. Those were the harsh rules of border control quarantine. Having been abandoned on Afghan land, a sure and swift death awaited them. 

The thing was that Afghan soldiers hated our dogs. And the feeling was mutual, the dogs would sense the Afghan soldiers from miles away, ready to tear each and every one of them to pieces. 
Now, by the border, the merciless staccato of their automated weapons firing on our devoted and abandoned dogs and their pre death howls were a haunting and endless accompaniment to the nightly cannonade.

That was the first time I felt the disorienting feeling of foul betrayal. Now it does not leave me all these years, but that was when I clearly felt it for the first time. Was there really nothing that could have been done, no provisions made ahead of time for vets to be present at the border, some sort of special controls? Then already, nobody cared about anything. Much like afterwards, when nobody cared about the fates of those who had been through Afghanistan, the many people crippled by this war, the families killed by grief for their loved ones.
But this started at that time, in those last days and hours of the war. I remember with how much indifference and condescension the soldiers were awarded their commemorative watches. Brought straight from the factory, shiny & brand new by haughty colonels from Moscow GLAVPUR, who would hastily shove cheap and flimsy cardboard boxes into the calloused, much worked hands of our soldiers, not having the courage or the care to look into their eyes.
And afterwards, on the other side of the border, after loud pompous meetings and lofty speeches, those who had returned from war would be herded like criminals onto special platforms, hemmed in by sub divisions that had never smelled the smell of gunfire, to be exiled to far flung garrisons, as the flags covered in the glory of fathers and sons were packed away into storage.

New- fangled political tendencies even then were already forcing new 'democrats' to sweep the Afghan war under the carpet as our country's great shame. And yes - so it was, if we talk of the politicians who unravelled it, and then without shame betrayed and sold out both the army and the memory of the fallen. But history exerted its own cruel revenge on them. It was exactly this betrayal that afterwards ruined a mighty country, at first snaking through many small Afghans fragmenting the USSR, continuing to this day in what we have seen in Chechnya. Truly, history teaches us only that, that she does not teach us anything at all.

And how long has the tragic list of our losses grown since. How many new names we remember whilst lifting that third, always silent, toast!
How many died from their injuries, how many perished in Tadzhikistan, in the Caucasus, and Transcaucasus?

How many took their own lives, not having been able to live with the soullessness of the aftermath of those political lies?

We continue to lose friends at that very Afghan war. How prematurely we were left by generals Zaharov, Sherbakov, Dobrinin, Visotsky, Karpuhin. What a tragedy was the murder, on duty, of Victor Petrovich Polianichko. How pointless and frightening was the passing of Artem Borovik. These losses do not and never will bear count.

And on that day, 15 February 1989, we almost forebode all this, having gathered at the level crossing at the entrance to the bridge over Amu Darya.

The long columns of armed vehicles had already formed and stretched out, soldiers and officers buffing the insidious Afghan dust from their newly cleaned and shined boots and shoes, diligently attaching to their uniforms the many medals and orders.

Having gathered around him all the remaining commanders General Gromov gave his last orders. He and I spoke then, briefly. ""Without a doubt, I would erect a monument to each and every one who has been through Afghanistan"" said he - ""but, you know, we will look back on these years as the best of our lives"".

Then and now I heard and continue to hear those words from many. And, I do think so myself. This was a time that each and every one of the soldiers and commanders felt their irreplaceability, how much they were needed by their Homeland and comrades. Every single one was as a fighter jet poised for take off.

The command to start the engines sounded, the flags were raised & crossing lifted and the head car containing the General and battle flag roared away.

And so, on that long awaited Wednesday, the Afghan War was finished. Finished for the sake of the history books, at least. In our hearts and minds and in our daily lives, it continues to this day.

112zihi,"I just read the Andromeda strain and I couldn't put it down - first book in a long time I've read all in one day. I also can't believe how much a book about a killer space virus made me think - such a unique combination of thriller style / story with big, interesting scientific ideas!","I'm left feeling like Michael Crichton is the literary equivalent of Steven Spielberg. Roughly the same time period, and they both made hugely popular creative works with mass market appeal that also have some real depth. If you haven't read any Crichton, do yourself a favor and pick some up!

**Here's the setup** of Andromeda Strain (no spoilers, but putting in tags just in case you like to go in totally blank slate):

>!A US government program is sending satellites with scoops into orbit, looking for alien organisms that can survive the void of space. When one of the scoops comes down in the Arizona desert two soldiers are sent out to pick it up. But as they get closer, they realize the signal has moved - someone has already picked up the object and moved it into the tiny town of Piedmont. As the two men pull into town, bodies line the streets. In less than five minutes they are dead too.  !<

>!The government is forced to mobilize Project Wildfire, a top-secret emergency response protocol. Four of the nation’s most elite biophysicists are summoned to a clandestine underground laboratory where they must race to understand and contain the crisis. But the Andromeda Strain proves different from anything they’ve ever seen - and what they don’t know could not only hurt them, but lead to unprecedented worldwide catastrophe.!<

**And what makes it great (and what held it back)**:

The central idea is unbelievably propulsive and the beginning of the novel is unforgettable. Unfortunately it slows a bit as the book goes on and the ending isn’t very satisfying - but I still couldn’t put the book down and read the whole thing in one day.

The most unique thing about the book is the narrative style - its framed as a top secret document detailing real events, and that very much helps make it feel real, engrossing, and a little transgressive that we get to read it. 

One watch out about that narrative style - the book includes a number of pages of maps, printouts from military computers, comms transcripts, and pages of top-secret documents which are really not meant to be read line by line, but add to the realistic feeling. But on audiobook they read all those words out verbatim and its pretty brutal - so this is a better book to read in print than audio.

The core concept is based on a proposed answer to the Fermi-Paradox.  Essentially if we are going to encounter extraterrestrial life, it is far more likely we encounter single-cell or viral organisms first before complex life just because it is much more likely to evolve and develop. That's just one of a wide number of interesting scientific ideas and theories that are raised throughout the book. As a testament to how real the science felt, there is a bibliography at the end - and I felt like I needed to check if the work he’s citing is real. Its not, but could have fooled me!

Definitely my favorite Crichton novel - check it out if you haven't read it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/112zihi/i_just_read_the_andromeda_strain_and_i_couldnt/,2023-02-15T14:39:35Z,60,184,books,It Ends with Us,POST
rwehf2,"Slaughter House 5 is not about War, it is about Determinism.","In discussing this book with others, I'm often surprised by people's take on the central themes of the book. There was even a recent post about Slaughter House 5 being primarily about War and its absurdity. 

The book does take place during WW2, and the horrors of War are certainly well illustrated, but ultimately the war is just a vessel to convey the central message of Slaughter House 5: There is no Free Will.

The protagonist shifts through time and space, following his determined path, and encounters aliens that can ""see"" the 4th dimension. The Aliens even explicitly tell him that in the Universe, the concept of Free Will only exists on Earth. They themselves know when, where, and how their civilization will come to an end.

This isn't a mere Sci-Fi ""what if"", none of us actually have Free Will. Vonnegeut could be wrong about Determinism, but even with Indeterminism we don't get Agency. It just means that there is some RNG affecting our decisions. Did you choose your biological make up? Your parents? Being born at the time and location that you did? Is there a *you*, other than the circumstances of your birth you had no control over? 

Those of you who have read his other books such as Breakfast of Champions, Sirens of Titan, or Galapagos will be familiar with this theme. Humans can be affected by ""bad chemicals"", or their brain will ""make them to do something"", even describing human beings as meat machines. This is his humorous way of illustrating this fact for us. 

Doubtless there are many Libertarians among you that would disagree that we don't have Free Will, but what's important here is that Vonnegeut believed it. With this framework, lets re-examine the events of Slaughter House 5 and see if we can't get a different reading through the lens of Determinism. 

Murder, pain, cruelty and death. The horror of war ramped up to a scale that our ancestors would not have believed possible. Children burned alive, whole families suffocated in the bombing of Dresden. Why? Where is the meaning in all this?

There is no meaning. There are no ""good guys"", or ""bad guys"". There are humans in ""good"" circumstances, with ""good"" brain chemistry, and there are humans in ""bad"" circumstances with ""bad"" brain chemistry, and circumstantial events that this gives birth to. Meat robots that, through no fault of their own, and following the cosmic dictates of causality, rape, kill, or are in turn raped and killed. It's all totally absurd. 

So it goes, so it goes, so it goes. Words repeated throughout the book, neither condoning, or condemning. 

Of course, we should not commit genocide, we should not kill or rape. In the grand scheme of things however, events were set in motion at the moment of the Big Bang, and it inevitably lead to families being suffocated at a fire bombing in Dresden(as well as even worse horrors during WW2). Totally absurd, but so it goes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rwehf2/slaughter_house_5_is_not_about_war_it_is_about/,2022-01-05T04:50:22Z,57,2,books,It Ends with Us,POST
13tl3gz,"I read ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" today and it was incredible!","Today I was going through a book fair and noticed a book of two F. Scott Fitzgerald short stories, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""Head and Shoulders"". I was taken aback because I had heard of (but not seen) the film and did not know Fitzgerald was behind the story that inspired it. I read it in an hour while on the bus back home and actually was on the verge of tears by the time it was all over - not so much because it was a tragic story, but because of how how unbelievably human it all felt, and how human *it made me feel*.

It is one of those pieces of art that just captures our permanent struggle to understand the limited time we have here - and the even more limited time of our youths. Above all, and this may sound weird, it felt to me like a work that could only have ever been made by us, by our briefly-lived little species. It has so many themes that are expressed so subtly and beautifully (from the inevitability of age and death to the incapability of others to accept reality when faced with a break in normalcy) that I honestly think it summarises so many of my anxieties about life incredibly well. 

The progression of Button first hanging out with his grandfather (two old men, despite one having just been born), then with his father (people think they're brothers at one point), then with his grandson as a kid, and ending up all alone in kindergarten forgetting everything he ever did as the only kids who know him grow up normally and move to other grades, may be one of the most brutal things ever put to paper.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13tl3gz/i_read_the_curious_case_of_benjamin_button_today/,2023-05-27T23:13:33Z,6,28,books,It Ends with Us,POST

ici0xi,"I just finished Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh, and feel this nervousness and sadness that it’s over","I was a long time fan of the movie so I decided to pick up the book and finished it in two days. I was completely enthralled by the world and especially the characters. It spoke to me personally on a really deep level that I was not expecting. On a level that shook me at times. It’s been some years (not many by a lot people’s standards in all honestly) that I left behind a group of friends who had so many parallels to many of the characters in the story. Though growing up in a completely different part of the world, the characters were reskinned, but still the same at the core. Trouble makers like Begbie. Always causing hugggge trouble wherever we were, and putting themselves on a pedestal that we went along with just because it was safer for us that way. Scarily selfish fucks like Sick Boy, who you just never could trust because of the lack of regard they showed others. Passive and hopeless fucks like Spud, who kinda just went with the flow and didn’t really have the balls or maybe just the knowledge to do anything different. Even guys like the Second Prize, just always fucking gone on some sort of drugs, barely a person just there. We did drugs, sold drugs, committed crimes, had crimes committed against us, seemingly to no end. I think when Renton says (and I’m paraphrasing) “what can you do? they’re  mates” it really did something to me, because it’s such a weak defense but one I used for years. I left them though, me and another close friend from the group, and have worked to stay straight for some years now.  I know this has turned into a personal story rather than a review, but the book made such an impact and spoke to me so personally. I just didn’t want it to end. Maybe partly cuz I miss that world. Idk why but I miss the chaos, even though I was miserable. Really the most empty I have ever felt. I mostly didn’t want it to end though because I really want to know if Renton made it, I guess partly because I want to know if I will. I wonder if I’ll somehow go back one of these days.

uigzdm,"In 1980, the godmother of SFF, Octavia Butler, wrote an amazing essay that for many reasons hasn't been read or heard of. If you you are a writer, reader, or lover of SFF you owe it to yourself to read it. She skillfully writes about issues still plaguing the entire industry today.","> Fourteen years ago, during my first year of college, I sat in a creative writing class and listened as my teacher, an elderly man, told another student not to use black characters in his stories unless those characters’ blackness was somehow essential to the plots. The presence of blacks, my teacher felt, changed the focus of a story, drew attention from the intended subject.

These are the first words of Octavia butlers powerful essay, ""The Lost Races of Science Fiction"". These words written in 1980 would make me think Butler could predict the future. Her words hit home today even greater when conversations of diversity are more readily had, but came from a a time when people rarely talked about diversity and representation to this extent. The biggest reason for me making this post is because people haven't read her or this wonderfully crafted essay. It was 1980 and it didn't make a splash in the lit world. Partly because it was in a magazine that was only published once and was ran by a teenager. Thankfully it was collected in a book recently so it's more easily available. 


 I've recently re read it and found a few parts so profound I wanted to share them and start a discussion. I'll include a link to the the entire essay at the bottom.

-----

>Science fiction reaches into the future, the past, the human mind. It reaches out to other worlds and into other dimensions. Is it really so limited, then, that it cannot reach into the lives of ordinary everyday humans who happen not to be white?

>Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Amerindians, minority characters in general have been noticeably absent from most science fiction. Why? As a black and a science fiction writer, I’ve heard that question often. I’ve also heard several answers. And, because most people try to be polite, there have been certain answers I haven’t heard. That’s all right. They’re obvious.

>Best, though, and most hopeful from my point of view, I’ve heard from people who want to write science fiction, or who’ve written a few pieces, perhaps, and who would like to include minority characters, but aren’t sure how to go about it. Since I’ve had to solve the same problem in reverse, maybe I can help.

>But first some answers to my question: Why have there been so few minority characters in science fiction?

>Let’s examine my teacher’s reason. Are minority characters—black characters in this case—so disruptive a force that the mere presence of one alters a story, focuses it on race rather than whatever the author had in mind? Yes, in fact, black characters can do exactly that if the creators of those characters are too restricted in their thinking to visualize blacks in any other context.

>This is the kind of stereotyping, conscious or subconscious, that women have fought for so long. No writer who regards blacks as people, human beings, with the usual variety of human concerns, flaws, skills, hopes, etc., would have trouble creating interesting backgrounds and goals for black characters. No writer who regards blacks as people would get sidetracked into justifying their blackness or their presence unless such justification honestly played a part in the story. It is no more necessary to focus on a character’s blackness than it is to focus on a woman’s femininity.

On the various writing subs and even reading subs we see people talk about black characters as being political and only write them if it's relevant to the story. Or if they see a character who's black they need immediate justification for that or else it takes them out of the story. 

She suggests that writers who have trouble giving black characters interesting backgrounds and stories, and writers who get sidetracked justifying “why” a character is black, are incapable of regarding black people as people. She compares this to the stereotyping that women have historically received and concludes, “It is no more necessary to focus on a character’s blackness than it is to focus on a woman’s femininity.” This is especially apt because of her double identity as a woman and a black person and how they intersect. 



>Now, what about the possibility of substituting extra-terrestrials for blacks—in order to make some race-related point without making anyone…uncomfortable? In fact, why can’t blacks be represented by whites—who are not too thoroughly described—thus leaving readers free to use their imaginations and visualize whichever color they like?

>I usually manage to go on being polite when I hear questions like these, but it’s not easy.

>Onward, then. Let’s replace blacks with tentacled beings from Capella V. What will readers visualize as we describe relations between the Capellans and the (white) humans? Will they visualize black humans dealing with white humans? I don’t think so. This is science fiction, after all. If you tell your readers about tentacled Capellans, they’re going to visualize tentacled Capellans. And if your readers are as touchy about human races as you were afraid they might be when you substituted the Capellans, are they really likely to pay attention to any analogy you draw? I don’t think so.

This is something I've felt but usually don't have the vocabulary to accurately explain. I've seldom met a ""racism but it's androids, elves, meta humans, aliens"" metaphor that didn't fall flat to me as a black person. Butler takes everything I've felt about it and puts it on display. It always made me feel like white people couldn't emphasize with me as a black person when I talk about racism and discrimination but could completely get it if it was an alien or fantasy race. 



>That brings me to another question I hear often at science fiction conventions. “Why are there so few black science fiction writers?” I suspect for the same reason there were once so few women science fiction writers. Women found a certain lack of authenticity in a genre that postulated a universe largely populated by men in which all the power was in male hands, and women stayed in their male-defined places.

>Science fiction writers come from science fiction readers, generally. Few readers equal few writers. The situation is improving, however. Blacks are not as likely as whites to spend time and money going to conventions, but there is a growing black readership. Black people I meet now are much more likely to have read at least some science fiction, and are not averse to reading more. 

She touches on a question that is still being asked. A question that ive asked too when I was younger. I think the growing readership gets more diverse every year year! I think that the more we get diverse readers we'll see diverse writers get more chances and properly compensated because the disparity between award winning and exceptional black authors and new and unproven white authors is too high. [This article about the viral hashtag  #PublishingPaidMe into the numbers] (https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/6/17/21285316/publishing-paid-me-diversity-black-authors-systemic-bias) 

>A more insidious problem than outright racism is simply habit, custom. Science fiction has always been nearly all white, just as until recently, it’s been nearly all male. A lot of people have had a chance to get comfortable with things as they are. Too comfortable. Science fiction, more than any other genre, deals with change—change in science and technology, and social change. But science fiction itself changes slowly, often under protest. You can still go to conventions and hear deliberately sexist remarks—if the speaker thinks he has a sympathetic audience. People resent being told their established way of doing things is wrong, resent being told they should change, and strongly resent being told they won’t be alone any longer in the vast territory—the universe—they’ve staked out for themselves. I don’t think anyone seriously believes the world of the future will be all white any more than anyone believes the present world is all white. But custom can be strong enough to prevent people from seeing the need for science fiction to reflect a more realistic view. 

>A second insidious problem is laziness, possibly combined with ignorance. Authors who have always written of all-white universes might not feel particularly threatened by a multicolored one, but might consider the change too much trouble. After all, they already know how to do what they’ve been doing. Their way works. Why change? Besides, maybe they don’t know any minority people. How can they write about people they don’t know?

Custom and laziness are two of the biggest reasons why science fiction and fantasy has been kept so monochromatic and from the outside looks so unwelcoming to anyone who isn't the standard white man. Customarily she makes the point of people getting comfortable and people get upset at being told their established way is wrong. It's why people need to keep speaking up when talking about diversity so the laziness problem doesn't cone into play where people get complacent and they won't do the thing all writers have to do research. Thankfully butler covers that too. 

>But what do authors ordinarily do when they decide to write about an unfamiliar subject?

>They research. They read—in this case recent biographies and autobiographies of people in the group they want to write about are good. They talk to members of that group—friends, acquaintances, co-workers, fellow students, even strangers on buses or waiting in lines. I’ve done these things myself in my reverse research, and they help. Also, I people-watch a lot without talking. Any public situation offers opportunities.

Thirty years later, Octavia Butler’s words still hold true. Science fiction is getting more diverse, but minority characters are still sorely lacking. Books written by straight white men still flood the market, many of which conveniently forget the existence of people who exist outside of this demographic. However, Octavia Butler would be pleased to know that there are more black science fiction writers today than there were in 1980. Take a look at N.K. Jemisin, opens a new window, who broke new ground in 2016 by becoming the first black author to win a Hugo Award for Best Novel!

I don't wanna put the whole article up because it wouldn't fit and because it deserves to be read in its entirety. But maybe my words aren't enough! Here's a few excerpts from reviewers talking about the essay. 


In her review for the Women’s Review of Books, Nisi Shawl writes about

Butler’s long out-of-circulation 1980 essay, “Lost Races of Science Fiction.” A manifesto about the erroneousness of excluding black characters from SF because of the “messiness” involved in depicting nonwhites, “Lost Races” ends with a half-jubilant, half-deploring assessment of science fiction’s attitudes toward inclusivity and prejudice. “Times have changed,” Butler decrees. In the next sentence, though, she admonishes the field that “it still has a long way to go.” That her pronouncements on this matter hold true nearly forty years after they were first published speaks volumes about the slow rate of social change and Butler’s continuing centrality to our understanding of the fantastic genres.

A review in Bookforum calls it “a blunt 1980 essay on the absence of nonwhite characters in the genre.”

rzeema,A Deadly Education. I Hated it," Probably  one of the most annoying books I've ever read. Rather than the author  revealing the protagonists world  through character interactions and  dialogue, the book is a pure narrative.  Every time I thought the  narrative portion explaining this strange world, was coming to an end  and the author was going to delve deeper into intriguing scenes between  the characters and let us get to know them better, I was sorely  disappointed. Any tiny bit of dialogue between characters was simply  used as a segue to another narrative. Worst, the narrative is INCREDIBLY  repetitive. The protagonist repeats over and over again how no one  likes her and she's burdened with amazing power (though no one knows it)  and how she doesn't need anyone's help. Each situation she encounters  is used to say 'see I told you my life sucks' and starts her off again  complaining about her world. I got so tired of reading ""This means....""  or ""That means...."" as if I was reading an instruction manual. Which  sadly, it turns out I was. There is nothing entertaining about this  book. According to the protagonist - who is quite convincing - her world  is deadly and horrible, there is no escape, just dread, worms in food  and misery.  There is nothing here that makes me want to cheer for this  character. She's arrogant, nasty and self-pitying. I kept thinking this  would evolve into a real story, but the characters narrative never gets  better or changes, and I simply wished she'd get eaten, so the book  would end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rzeema/a_deadly_education_i_hated_it/,2022-01-09T00:19:09Z,15,24,books,It Ends with Us,POST
81xa1q,"Just finished Murakami's 1Q84. I know it's controversial, but I loved every second of it.","I'm sorry if this comes off as pretentious or annoying, but I just finished it and I'm really excited. I've never posted here, so also sorry if this turns into a rambling mess.

I loved *1Q84* because to me, it was Brecht's epic theater in novel form. For those unfamiliar, Brecht was an influential playwright in the Weimer Republic. In a nutshell, he developed ""epic theater"" as a means of separating the audience from the play they were watching. He was big on promoting critical thinking about every aspect of the story and performance, rather than getting sucked into the story and suspending all disbelief. 

As soon as Murakami mentioned the lyrics to ""It's Only a Paper Moon"" early on, I immediately thought about Brecht's *Drums in the Night*. I know the better reference is probably *Streetcar*, but I think having that Brecht in my brain really changed the way I looked at the novel. 

Murakami never fails to mention that in every world, there is a 'paper moon'. In this novel, every world is fake, insofar as none of them are really ""real"" on their own. Hell, he spends a lot of time waxing poetic about what it means to be real. All of the worlds, from the 'regular' one in the beginning to 1Q84 itself to the 'new' one at the end, play out on the same stage. They have the same characters, the same locations. He even describes the same traffic on the highway.

In *Drums in the Night*, the 'paper moon' is literal: it's referring to the literal stage prop moon, drawing the audience's attention to the fact that it isn't the real moon, but a paper circle on a wire. Murakami does the exact same thing, using the 'paper moon' to draw the reader's attention to the fact that no world in the novel's universe stands on its own. Every world stands at intersections with all the others. Often questions that seem to be left open-ended at the end of the book were answered in the beginning, but in a different world.

To respond to biggest complaints that I've seen about the ending (namely, that the Little People are never explained):

We're told pretty much from the get-go that the Little People are incomprehensible on a human scale. Personally, I was happy to leave it at that. To me, the Little People weren't the point of the story; I didn't come away from the book needing more information about them. 

The reason for that is that I believe Tengo and Aomame are stand-ins for the reader. They're regular people for whom the rules of this new bizarre world of 1Q84 are never firmly established. We don't know anything they don't know, even at the end. They're happy with the general lack of resolution, so we're meant to be too. 

While I get why that would turn a lot of people off, it once again reminded me of Brecht. Just like in epic theater, Murakami wanted the reader to be aware that they were reading a book. He was playing with omniscience and form. As the reader, we generally expect to be able to make connections that the characters don't, because our situational awareness is meant to be greater than theirs. We expect to come to an understanding at the end of a long journey. Murakami doesn't let that happen. Through constant repetition of the plot of the novel in the third act, he's reminding us that even though we're reading in the third person, we can only see what the characters see. They all see the same thing. No matter how hard they try to figure out what's going on, they get no new information. Neither do we. 

He established how he would deliver his exposition and never wavered from it, because to break it and give the reader extra information that Tengo and Aomame didn't have would dissociate us from them. Hell, when he wants to give new information, he brings in Ushikawa, but sticks to his template. In that way, I think *1Q84* has the most consistent narrative style of any book I've ever read.

I have more, but this seems really long already. What did y'all think about it? While I liked *Kafka on the Shore* better as a story, I think as a piece of writing, *1Q84* is really impressive and experimental.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/81xa1q/just_finished_murakamis_1q84_i_know_its/,2018-03-04T11:56:48Z,37,108,books,It Ends with Us,POST
ldasw0,It’s okay to be confused by American Psycho. That’s kinda the point.,"I just finished American Psycho, and though it was one of the most insightful, well written pieces of literature I’ve ever read, I will never read it again. I am definitely not alone in holding this opinion. 

As with most pieces of classic literature, one tends to puzzle over the “deeper meaning” of phrases or chapters that seem completely random. We assume that the author couldn’t possibly include a 10 page dissection of Huey Lewis without it having some metaphorical correlation to the book’s main point. After finishing the novel, I spent days trying to puzzle out the significance of Patty Winters interviewing Bigfoot, or the mind numbing descriptions of Bateman’s apartment. The answer, I finally concluded, was that there wasn’t any. The narrator is completely unreliable, but even in the head of psychotic Bateman, the reader doesn’t immediately incorporate this into their perception of the novel. We take it for granted that the events described are actually happening, unless we are explicitly told otherwise. However, I was finally able to make the connection: if Patrick Bateman can fabricate some zany topic for the morning’s Patty Winters show, how can we be sure the other less savory scenes are being accurately described? Is anything he says real? And if he is in fact based in reality at some moments, say during his many bull sessions with various associates, how can we be sure the murders aren’t real? The fluctuation of reality and fantasy is so undetectable that we can never really be sure if we are viewing reality or just some sick fantasy. And that’s okay. Because what Ellis wants us to get from this book is not descriptions of disturbingly realistic sex and violence. He wants us to see how unstable Bateman is, and he wants us, most of all, to be confused. Because, at the end of the day, Bateman is more than a character. He is a symbol of a culture of confusion, violence, and existential rage. He is a racist, a bully, a serial killer, and an insatiable charmer, all at the same time. He’s a true American psycho.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ldasw0/its_okay_to_be_confused_by_american_psycho_thats/,2021-02-05T16:26:52Z,22,69,books,It Ends with Us,POST
riecqr,"My thoughts on Death Book by Sadhguru: Last year I lost my grandfather, it was my first encounter with death in such proximity & since then my fear of death escalated even more and somehow I got hold of this book. It's one of the most intense books I have ever read. Not for the faint-hearted!","We prepare for exams, interviews, etc but nobody teaches us how to prepare for and handle death. It happens to all, yet we consider it taboo while having a conversation. The writer is explaining how death is a part of us. He is questioning why are humans so scared to die?

Something I found interesting was that from starting till the end, the book doesn't encourage the reader about death or come across as having a suicidal or nihilistic tone. It possesses a quality that will make you more focused to live a graceful, peaceful, healthy, and happy life.  


The book is divided into three parts :  


**Part 1 - Life & Death in one breath**  


If we breathe a little more consciously we will notice with every inhalation there is life, with every exhalation there is death! So, life is death & death is life!Once we come to terms with death & are conscious that we are going to die, we will want to make every moment of our life as beautiful as possible. We should be aware of our mortality on a daily basis & live in such a way that if we die today it is all right with us! This section deals with the process & quality of death along with maha samadhi & so much more.  


**Part 2- The gracefulness of death**  


It signifies the quality of the final moment ie; the awareness or quality which is brought in within you just before you die is the quality that will continue after your death.For eg-when, we sleep if we are happy/sad, that quality will continue throughout the sleep & that's what happens in death!This section talks about preparing for a good death, assistance for the dying, ghosts, grief & mourning.  


**Part 3- Life after death**  


This section explains the journey of life energy transcending from a dimension to another without any hell/heaven story! Basically, the spiritual aspect of life and death.

Sharing my favorite excerpt from the book: “What is the biggest wonder of life?’ Without hesitation, Yudhishthira famously answers, ‘Hundreds and thousands of living beings meet death at every moment, yet the foolish man thinks himself deathless and does not prepare for death. This is the biggest wonder of life.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/riecqr/my_thoughts_on_death_book_by_sadhguru_last_year_i/,2021-12-17T10:13:23Z,17,77,books,It Ends with Us,POST
1avzi0e,"I just finished reading ""The Traveler"" of John Katzenbach, first published in 1987. I'd like to share my spoilery thoughts about it.","John Katzenbach is one of my favourite authors, I got acquainted with his work, like many people, when I read The Analyst, an awesome book. I've also read The Analyst II (not as good as the first but still pretty enjoyable), Jack's Boys (entertaining but a bit flawed in the villain department) and Just Cause (I haven't finished it yet but as far as I've read it's pretty good). 

Before going into heavy spoiler territory, I'll start by saying I super recommend this book. It's a 9/10 for me. It deals with difficult subjects like sex offenders, serial killers, and trauma really well. Plus it's also entertaining if you enjoy stories with detectives and investigations of crimes. 

But now onto the main topic. Spoilers ahead. The Traveler is the oldest of Katzenbach's books that I've read. It's events happen in the late eighties, and that's a pretty significant detail, considering that the main antagonist is a serial rapist and killer, who is himself, well... very interested and educated on the epidemic of serial killers on the USA during that time period. 

**MAIN PROTAGONIST N°1:**

There's the main protagonist, Mercedes Barren, a very skilled detective working for the police, who's chasing down the villain for personal reasons: One of the guy's most recent victims was her niece, who was almost a daughter to her due to her lack of biological children, and helping her younger sister raise her was a coping mechanism of sorts to heal the pain from the death of her husband during a war. 

She struggles throughout the book with keeping her anguish and hate in check while hunting down the villain, and while her cause is just (the villain had gotten away with his rape and murder of the niece and another unrelated serial killer had been convicted for the crime) she does cross into slightly morally questionable territory at times, specially regarding the other main protagonist of the book (I'll talk about him in a moment). Overall, a solid protagonist, although her POV ended up becoming slightly less interesting and engaging to me than the other three (the other MC, the main villain, and... well let's call her the secondary antagonist; more on that later). 

She ends up finally confronting the main villain at the end and while she doesn't manage to kill him herself, she does contribute to him finally being stopped. 

&#x200B;

**MAIN PROTAGONIST N°2:**

The other protagonist of this story, introduced a bit later on, is Martin Jeffers, a psychiatrist working on a state facility for the mentally ill, and specialised with dealing with sex offenders. I found him the most sympathetic character of the story along with the secondary antagonist. He's the younger brother of the main villain, and for a good chunk of the book he's unaware of his brother's crimes, while ironically serving as a therapist for the inmates in his psychiatric responsible for the same vile deeds as his own brother. 

Through him (and also through his brother, but we'll get to him later) we explore the psychology, motivations, and mentality of sex offenders. The book does a good job in analyzing them beyond the safe and easy ""they are evil monsters and should get castrated and killed, end of story"" take. It doesn't justify them in the slightest, it doesn't shy away from showing how malicious and depraved these people can be; it simply explores how rapists and murderers are created, what drives them to do what they do, and what can be done to rehabilitate them, in other words, what can be done to make them realize and hate what they've done and live on their lives, well... not raping and killing anymore.

Now more onto Martin himself. He's a very intelligent, introspective, sensitive and well meaning man, a far cry from his despicable older brother despite sharing the same horrible upbringing: They were the sons of a drunk with a criminal history, and a prostitute; they were abandoned by their bio parents when they were little more than toddlers, and got adopted by an adult female cousin and her husband, whom would raise the two boys coldly, neglectfully and even abusively. Martin has, understandably, rage and resentment from his upbringing and rightfully doesn't hold any of his parents (biological or adopted) in high regard. However, that rage and trauma didn't manage to consume him and twist him into a monster like it happened with his brother. 

Furthermore, when the detective Barren crosses paths with him and rather forcefully and harshly makes him see the truth about his brother, Martin decides to help her catch him, although in his case not to kill him, but to arrest him and maybe ""save"" him from himself somehow. Martin struggles with his conflicting love for the big brother that protected and looked after him all his life, and the horror and fury the guy's crimes cause him. The final confrontation between the two brothers was the most anticipated moment for me of the entire book, and their relationship was maybe the most engaging thing about this story. 

Despite his hellish predicament, Martin Jeffers manages to maintain a balance between his love and his sense of justice and gets as much of a happy ending as this story can provide.

&#x200B;

**SECONDARY ANTAGONIST/SUPPORTING PROTAGONIST:**

A college student called Anne Hampton, she's by far the youngest (20 years old in contrast to the mid/late 30s of the other POVs) and initially the most innocent of the main characters. She was a normal young woman until she was kidnapped by the main villain and brainwashed into becoming his ""biographer"". She is forced to accompany the villain in his travels throughout the US while he talks about himself, about his twisted philosophy and interests, a little bit about his backstory, and about some trivial shit the guy feels like talking about. 

Anne struggles and learns to say and do the right things in order not to ""provoke"" the serial killer into beating her or even killing her, and is also forced to be an accomplice of some of his murders during the trip. While the main villain did a creepily efficient job into scaring her into submission, Anne slowly regains her identity and remembers she's not a criminal's biographer and punching bag, but a mere young woman in college with her own life and goals.

One of the most utterly satysfing moments in the book comes when during the final confrontation, Anne saves Mercedes from certain death at the hands of the villain by finally breaking free of her Stockholm Syndrome and shooting the guy, fatally wounding him and saving the day.

&#x200B;

**MAIN VILLAIN:**

A professional photographer and a... let's say ""professional"" serial rapist and killer called Douglas Jeffers. His *modus operandi* consists on him researching about the pattern of behaviour of a specific serial killer on a specific area, and then copying it when he himself is raping and murdering; after killing his victims, he takes photos of them. Because of this careful and calculating approach, he managed to kill people undetected for fourteen years, at least until Mercedes manages to track him down because of a misstep Douglas made while killing the woman's niece. 

He's a very interesting and compelling villain. He's vicious, remorseless, full of hatred and rage to his bio and adopted parents, disdainful of idealistic, naive or ""weak"" people, and also disdainful of impulsive serial rapists and killers. He has frequent mood swings while travelling with his kidnapping victim Anne: At one time he's casually and cheerfully chatting with her; at the other he's slapping her for saying the wrong thing or not being invested enough in his words. 

He's, as you would expect, a character easy to hate and fear. Me personally, I particularly hated and feared him as he mentally explained about how he broke and brainwashed Anne into doing his bidding. But I also found myself feeling some specks of empathy for Douglas when he would describe how he saw as a toddler the abusive way in which his prostitute bio mother was treated by her clients, the beatings he received by his adoptive father for little to no reason, how his adoptive mother/cousin would deliberately let him see her naked and changing clothes (it's subtly implied there was some sort of molestation in there although I might be wrong), and his protective instinct and love towards his brother Martin while growing up. Douglas Jeffers is a vile, cruel, raping and murdering psychopath, but he does have some little traces of humanity in there; not nearly enough to redeem him, but enough to make him layered and engaging beyond being just an entertaining villain. 

During his final confrontation with his brother, he coldly dismisses Martin's attempts to convince him of stopping his crimes and turning himself in, threatens to kill his little bro several times while openly expressing regret of having loved and protected him, and even shoots him... although he deliberately misses, realising himself that murdering his own brother (the person he practically raised, his companion, his only respite on a lifetime of abuse, and as he calls him inside his mind ""the only good part of me"") is the one line he cannot cross. This gives time and an opening for Anne and Mercedes to shoot and destabilise him out of his dominant position regarding them respectively. When Douglas has one final chance to kill the two women, Martin steps in the middle of them, and begs his brother one final time to stop. 

Douglas for once listens and tries to escape, but dies from his injuries soon afterwards, on a surprisingly somber final scene, while deliriously talking with his brother, mother and adoptive father.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I really liked this book, the way it handled it's POV characters, their journeys, and also the nuanced and careful way it analyzed such a delicate subject like sex crimes. The only weak aspect IMO is that it kinda wastes time with unnecessary and long descriptions of places sometimes. But that's it. 9/10.

bq57bu,"This is the worst book I've ever read, and it's being praised like no other. Is it me?","^(Edit, disclaimer: I don't hate the book, and I'm happy for the author that she got published, and I'm also happy there are others who do enjoy it. There's not a shred of resentment in me; only confusion.)


_Dear Friend, From My Life I Write To You In Your Life_ is the most empty thing I've ever read, and it's being praised as if it's another one of Camus'. It pisses me off to no end, because although it starts off very strongly, and although its prose is of quite a pleasant nature, the second page in it deteriorates into pseudo-philosophy, asking questions and raising topics that aren't further discussed, making it seem like all the critics only read the first page and judged it fantastic. It feels like the guy at the dinner table quoting Camus when asked what he'd like to drink, if that makes any sense.


I want to know your thoughts on the matter to figure out if it's just me.


The book begins with twenty four short, numbered paragraphs of which the topics swing about with no resolutions whatsoever. I'm talking tweet-sized sections here, so there's no time to think, alright? Just get in, loser, because we're going fast. 


Number one: MC is reminiscing on the first time she saw before-and-after photos after migrating to America, and she reflects on how definitive this concept seems—as if there's a clear distinction between what one was and what one is, and that therefore there is the possibility of leaving past mistakes behind. A stellar analogy by the author, and a cast iron ground for what seems to promise a great work of literature. 


Nope. 


Paragraph two cuts in without any further mention of the above: an acquaintance called, MC's husband met the woman, he brought her to the airport, and two weeks later the woman had jumped out of a window. MC doesn't visit the funeral.


Okay.


""Our memories tell more about now than then,"" MC continues right after, god knows why, and as if this is something about which everyone is in unison. ""Doubtless the past is real,"" she then proclaims. Over two millennia of philosophy settled right then and there, ladies and gentlemen. 


Paragraph three: past, present, and future are not one and the same MC explains. Roger. 


Paragraph four. MC is staying at a hospital for the second time. The first isn't mentioned, because why would it? MC then channels a bit of Freddie in telling that she too at times wishes not to have ever been born. Being alone in her thoughts, she then feels a 'collective sigh': her tears seemed to prove something. 


What on earth is a collective sigh in the first place, and how on earth can she experience one when she's precisely alone in a basement room? Her words, mind you; not mine!


But forget about all of this, because paragraph five, and everyone in MC's life apparently wonders what she's hiding: her mother, a bathhouse employee, and apparently that makes up everyone MC knows. If you're now wondering where the hell this is coming from, then welcome to the club: why would people think this; why would they ask this; why are we told about this? 


Next! Number six makes sure we're aware that there are five time zones in China—MC's country of birth—and that the whole nation uses one, unified zone. She reflects that time is ingrained in all our experiences and memories, and wonders how many of us have ever wished to have had a bit more time... The ellipse is not my addition. 


I could go on and on, but I'll spare you the other eighteen tweets, along with all the unfinished thoughts, philosophically interesting but otherwise out of place questions that are never actually further reflected upon, shallow references to Dostoevsky with no further weight to them, abruptly ended paragraphs, frequently strange and sometimes flawed interpunction, and at times even unfinished sentences. I wish I was being hyperbolic with that last one, but I'm not. I quote: ""Your roommate, several women said to me, eyeing her torn paper gown and oblivious half-nakedness when she moved about in the hallway, where we all sat on sofas or chairs, socializing as we had been encouraged to do."" What about this roommate? Why did these women bring her up? Now, you might think that perhaps the period was meant to be a comma and that what is now the next sentence would then have finished the first. That's very sharp of you, and very charitable, because nope: next paragraph. 


I shit you not; that actually happened: an unfinished sentence that raised several questions was the last sentence of a fucking paragraph. 


Please, for the love of literatue, can someone helpe out here? This book with a phenomenal title, a fantastic first page, and oftentimes even prose that makes me envious in ways I've rarely felt before—this book has won The Guardian's First Book Award, despite all of the above. 


And mind you: this is all only thirty pages in, and that with a font size that overly respects the far-sighted.

hph15m,What is it about the Dune prequels that make them so much worse?,"So I used to read a lot in highschool, but afterward I kind of just stopped for nearly 9 years. Then someone suggested I try reading Dune. I'll skip the parts where I got confused and ended up buying the 3 Novels that take place roughly 30-12 years before Dune that were co-written by Frank Herbert's son Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson. I ended up reading those 3 first and then moving on to the 6 official Dune books.

&#x200B;

I guess my question is, why do the prequels get so much hate? I definitely felt a tonal shift, but everyone Ive ever talked to about comparing these books just says ""Frank Herbert was a genius and his son sucks and the books suck"", but I guess I just don't get why? To me, Dune has been about two things:  
1. Amazingly immersive and interesting world-building and society-mixing  
2. The interesting dance between predictions, knowledge, fate and will and how they can all play off each other and change the world around us.

&#x200B;

Both of these things are just as heavily used in the prequels as Frank Herbert's original novels from my memory. So I guess I'm just looking for maybe someone a bit more ""scifi/fantasy"" literate to give a better explanation as to what the prequels fail to deliver that the original did.  I understand writing styles come with a certain taste, but with t he level of hate I see the prequels get Its difficult for me to assume its just that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hph15m/what_is_it_about_the_dune_prequels_that_make_them/,2020-07-11T20:25:11Z,26,24,books,It Ends with Us,POST
qoue0e,"McCarthy's work is not all just doom and gloom, and far from it (spoilers)","I get how you can read a book of his and be left feeling kinda down after it, as they show us the worst that human beings have to offer. But I'd argue that the message to the books, or at least the three I'll mention in this post, are actually pretty positive. Maybe a lil bittersweet, but the messages in Blood Meridian, Suttree, and The Road especially are finding the silver lining in a dark stormy cloud.

With The Road, I came away from it with a pretty good outlook on life, and not just because it showed me that we actually got it pretty good. That is a big part of it though, and I think it's intentional on McCarthy's part. This whole book he's describing this awful environment to the reader in great detail, and it's all just bad vibes all around. You really get a sense that there truly is no hope left and that life on Earth is on life support. But then the story ends with this wonderful epilogue describing the beauty of nature, and the thing is, that shit isn't some Narnia fantasy world or anything, it's reality. He's dragged us through this awful world for so long, that real life almost feels mystical by the end of it. But it is real! We don't even gotta do anything to experience it.

Maybe it's debatable if that was his intent or not, but imo he was trying to make the reader gain greater appreciation for what we have now, and what we're potentially taking away from future generations. A lot of people see the epilogue as negative though, which I suppose makes sense from the actually characters' perspectives, so I suppose it's 50/50 if that's actually a positive message. But what is a positive message from the same book is that the father's worldview and the ideas he had been feeding his son get proven wrong at the end. You'd think that the kid would just get cannibalized like 5 minutes after the father dies because apparently they're the only people in the whole world that can be trusted. But that ain't true and literally the first people the kid meets are good and take him in.

I don't see how you spin that into a negative ending, maybe humanity's even got a chance, who knows. I think a less skilled writer would've just gone full grimdark on the boy at the end, meanwhile McCarthy can have a somewhat uplifting ending to The Road of stories.

While I'm pretty sure about what I've just said about the Road, I can't say the same for Blood Meridian because its ending is completely up in the air with thousands of interpretations. But to me, I think that the judge kills him at the end because the kid pissed him off, as I don't really like the theory of the kid killing the little girl, even though it's obvious that McCarthy intentionally left it as a valid interpretation. Maybe the protagonist being apparently brutally murdered by the antagonist is not the best of endings, but I think the fact that the kid managed to resist the judge's teachings and rattle him is pretty powerful. I've always liked the scene at the water well where he neither accepts his money nor shoots him. I doubt anyone has ever disrespected the judge to that level before and maybe the first time someone has ever truly defied him. Probably why he later chased him across the desert to try to murder him.

So while the protagonist dies and the antagonist seems to be dancing in triumph at the end, I feel like it's a hollow victory. He failed to convert the kid and killed him out of spite. Like an older brother ripping the controller out of his younger brother's hands because he's losing.

And Suttree isn't even debatable imo. It's all about the main character slowly starting to appreciate life again and at the end he gets himself out of the downward spiral he had been in for the past few years.

So you've got one book telling you to appreciate nature and trust others, another showing a character overcoming his inner demons (and getting killed for it, but lets ignore that part), and the last about living life to its fullest.

I was reading through the ""reviews"" on Amazon and on an earlier thread here on /r/books and was disappointed to see so many people talking about Harry Potter.

I thought the book was excellent and I became extremely involved with the characters in this rather short novel. Reading through, I found that I knew people like this. Like all of them and had no trouble identifying with them or seeing them as real people. The character development was just fantastic and leave it to Rowling to illuminate a setting and make it feel like you're right there, observing their life like a ghost in the room.

There was no magic, no crazy plot twists, nothing really out of the ordinary. An ordinary couple of months in an ordinary village with more or less ordinary people. Rowling walks us through their lives with ease ends the book as effortlessly as it had begun.

8kbxbh,Just finished Maus II... and realised it is more than just about the horrors of War,"It took me some time to pick up Maus II after I finished off Maus I a few days back \(you can check out [my views on Maus I](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8ijkhn/maus_by_art_spiegelman_finally_got_down_to_read_it/) here\). I had somehow assumed that Maus I and II were maybe one book, published in two parts. So, I was surprised to find out after I started reading Maus II that it actually came out 6 years after the first one.

As he has done earlier, Mr. Spiegelman delves into his process of writing, his interactions with his father, and the story of his father's ordeals. But we manage to glimpse into *his own* psyche here too. It must have been quite an interesting exercise for him to confront his insecurities and decide to write about it, and show us what he does.

The ""plot"", so to speak, picks up from where we left off with Vladek at the end of the previous book. And it goes as it does, but more interesting things happen around the plot too.

SPOILERS for Maus II and for Movies \- [From Dusk Till Dawn \(1996\)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116367/), [Psycho \(1960\)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054215/),  and [Ishqiya \(2010\)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345777/)

The 'genre reveal' \(as I am calling it\) is not a twist or a complete departure from the ongoing story \- like what happens in From Dusk Till Dawn, where it goes from Adventure/ Crime Drama to a Vampire movie at the halfway point, or like Psycho, where it goes from Crime Drama to a Serial Killer movie. Genre reveal is best exemplified by the subtlety of Ishqiya, where it seems to be a Crime Drama/ Romantic movie till the last quarter of the story, and we finally realise that it has been Film Noir all along.

The Genre reveal in Maus II was that it was a love story all along \- of Vladek and Anja. What really impacted me the most, was realising that around everything else that the books manage to cover, they also are a real and affecting love story between Vladek and Anja. The most prime example is that being in those times, Vladek could easily have left Anja when she had psychological troubles. But he managed to be with her during that time too. And seeing how Maus II ends, I now realise why Maus I did not move into the war straight away, but began the way it did \- with Vladek and Anja.

Again, it could be that I am reading this into it, but this is my review. So...

END SPOILERS

All in all, a slightly more easier read than Maus I. I would recommend to all those who may like reading about History, World War II, A man's survival across all odds, Relationship between a man and his son, Relationship between a man and his father, and above all, Love across varying years and circumstances.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8kbxbh/just_finished_maus_ii_and_realised_it_is_more/,2018-05-18T09:43:24Z,32,140,books,It Ends with Us,POST
m5ljdx,Kafka on the Shore went way over my head. Did I take away the wrong messages from it?,"*Kafka on the Shore* was a beautifully-written page turner that kept me intrigued from the very beginning to the final few pages. The only problem was that the book was metaphysical beyond belief and I definitely did not even process 2/3 of what was happening, LOL.  I've seen people take away a lot of stuff about the duality of soul and body, reality vs. dreams, and I find it super impressive people's brains are even capable of such complex themes! But I'm a real simpleton, so I took away more about the journey of Kafka and, actually, Hoshino. 

For Kafka, he set off on this ordeal with the intention he would never come home and this was his new life. In the end, through all the mind-bending trips throughout reality and dreams, he decides to head home; he doesn't have to be the ""toughest fifteen year old."" My takeaway was that it's ok to change our minds about a journey halfway through, and admit we misjudged or were wrong. Hoshino, on the contrary, embraced the adventure fully after being uncertain at the beginning. I suppose I read the text as a whole as advising us to suspend our expectations and was Murakami's twisted way of telling us to go with the flow. 

I know that's waaay too simple. I know it's a challenging book to read, but did anyone else feel kinda dumb after reading, especially compared to others? Maybe a second read would help me out!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m5ljdx/kafka_on_the_shore_went_way_over_my_head_did_i/,2021-03-15T14:11:32Z,14,27,books,It Ends with Us,POST
wj28ef,Can we talk about Fitzgerald's Tender Is the Night? I read the book but didn't enjoy it at all (spoilers),"It felt to me that the novel was written by a much less experienced Fitzgerald. There are quite a few problems and I don't know where to start.

I feel like Fitzgerald was trying to do too much (in terms of criticism of racial relationships, popular culture, capitalism), so much so that he did not even accomplish the lesser task of making the novel an enjoyable read.

Don't get me wrong, the novel was well written (e.g., the language really flowed). But the ideas and stories felt disjointed. And I didn't care about the characters. That was the biggest issue. And I think this is partly because of the jumps back and forth in time but more so due to the jarring changes in point of view, from Rosemary to Dick to Nicole...and back and forth.

And the various incidents described didn't seem related to each other or to the overall theme, if there was one. They were more like someone telling me about things that happened to them or they witnessed, which is why real life is not as interesting as good fiction. In other words, we could take out some of the minor characters and their stories, with the result would be a tighter narrative, not a more disjointed one.

The only time I found myself actually interested in the story was the big reveal soon after Rosemary's section ended: That Nicole was mentally ill and had been a patient of Dick's, and her mental illness being explained by the incestuous relationship with her dad. And I followed that story for a few chapters but that did not really go anywhere. In fact, by the end of the novel, we are focused on Dick and his alcoholism, and Nicole's issues all forgotten.

Well, I could go along with that too, with the thing about Dick's alcoholism being the main focus of the novel, only if I had learned more of what Dick was actually thinking and what motivated him. But for a psychiatrist, his motivations were surprisingly secret and unexplained. In a way, he was like Gatsby. Except he wasn't Gatsby and should have been much more self-aware. More importantly, Fitzgerald should have shared more of what Dick was feeling and thinking. If, that is, he wanted us to really sympathize with Dick and his unpleasantness toward the end.

Anyhow, there are probably other issues too with the novel but these are the ones that occur to me tonight. It's too bad because I think Fitzgerald is an exceptional writer and this book could have been much better. Of course, he himself really liked Tender Is the Night and considered it his best work but I'm thinking that may be for reasons that have more to do with novel's similarities to his own life (e.g., alcoholism) and problems with his wife than the novel being superior to anything else he'd written.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wj28ef/can_we_talk_about_fitzgeralds_tender_is_the_night/,2022-08-08T07:07:46Z,3,7,books,It Ends with Us,POST
ji1am6,"Stephans King ""IT"" is a letter to Lovecraft : Heres how you make Cosmic Horror Bro.","With Turtles and Bat shit crazy Man eating things. I gotta say I am impressed. Wasnt really ok with all the things in it ( pun intended), but Kings book makes sense in developing the horror making it a worthwhile ride. 

Maybe he took some coke and wrote the whole thing in one go but when someone goes to Lovecraft they will always miss the interactions that Lovecrafts will never have. They will miss the human mechanic and the relationships that cause us humans to struggle. Lovecraft brings adjectives and grammar, but thats it. King brings you the whole thing, verbal dialogues, emotion, anger, and fear. The latter being the very core of the book, how he explains what it is and what the creature is, how a cosmic being develops into mischief and is far veyond the shape of a spider, but the boys  and being humans can only grasp the true form as a spider. 
Lovecraft needs that in his books, example the shadow over innsmouth, you see the character great story but fuck all verbs and fuck all emotions. MoM only the atmosphere is built none of the emotions of characters are developed. Thats another thing. King does it precisely, you need to understand the motives and why the character made that move and decision. Thats how you build the character. 

Its sad to say but its the truth when you look at Lovecrafts life, a lot of people have pointed at this being his limitations (shutin, never went out). In a way its true. Lovecrafts use of the English language is amazing but there is that lack of dialogue and this causes a lacking to his stories. Lol IT is 10 times as big as Lovecrafts most sought out book and obliterates it, meaning you go through it like a hot knife in butter. 2 days. But MoM puts a strain in that its a big thick chunk of dictionary waiting for you to decipher. 

In the end where Lovecraft gives you no hope, King gives you the one thing everyone of us have. Hope. And thats why the endings of King end with the character escaping. 

Anyway thats my thoughts. In b4 haireless teens trying to counter ""ma humble points""....",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ji1am6/stephans_king_it_is_a_letter_to_lovecraft_heres/,2020-10-25T21:11:46Z,8,0,books,It Ends with Us,POST
kgbijg,Just finish the club dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte and I want to discuss it a bit. (spoilers),"So long ago I watched the movie the ninth gate, and I like it because it was a mystery/detective that revolves around book research with an ambiguous ending that involved supernatural elements. So I was about to rewatch the movie again but saw that it was based on a book, and I thought to myself that the book might have more answers or clues about the ending. 

now the first thing I must say that I enjoyed the book, I loved the characters, the setting, the atmosphere but was let down by the climax. The book has a lot of these meta commentaries about the book itself and other authors in that genre. Like yeah, we do a bunch of cliches but we're self-aware of it, but it's still a cliche though. like the supposed villain explaining everything, he was doing behind the curtain towards the end and then blames the reader for connecting two apparently unrelated plots. 

Like the hole anjou, wine/dumas club storyline was just a Sherlock Holmes or Scooby-Doo level plot that was too anticlimactic in my opinion, and the whole devil mystery was just there to throw us off. There was nothing paranormal about it, it all can be explained rationally. like we thought because some characters from the three musketeers were making an appearance throughout the story so you start to believe that the devil stuff is real as well, but since we learn that it was all orchestrated by Dumas fan club to get a thrill. So is the whole satan thing, It basically some crazy guy that thought he can summon the devil but he fails, and plus we didn't get any foreshadowing for it throughout the story, except maybe that he was acting antagonistically towards the main character at the beginning of the book. 

I think it's GRRM who said it, ""If you answer a mystery, you answer it by adding more mystery in its place. "" (or something like that,) and there was none of that in this book. Yeah, we don't know for sure what exactly happened to the guy after he did his ritual, or where the girl with the green eyes come from, but it all doesn't really matter by the end. So overall I must say it was a bit of a letdown, but to end on a positive note I will say that the research that went to write this book was impressive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kgbijg/just_finish_the_club_dumas_by_arturo_perezreverte/,2020-12-19T17:03:32Z,14,10,books,It Ends with Us,POST
svpoh7,"Is there a piece of literature that profoundly impacted you, even though you cannot remember fundamental details about it?","A little bit of context. I am French and while I now speak english (somewhat) fluently, it was not the case before 2009. My family moved from France to Australia, where my parents enrolled me in ESL classes and a year later, I was somewhat okay with English but not exactly fully fluent and to mediate this situation, I decided to choose drama as one of my HS subject.

That year, my teacher took us to watch a play, after having us read the text in the morning. I cannot remember the title, or even what really happened in it.. To be honest, due to the language situation, I am not even sure I fully understood everything that was being said. It was about a boy (a puppet that was operated by one, maybe two people) and all I know is that he had no heart and died at the end of the play. Everytime he would look at his mother he would do something with his hands, mimicking a heartbeat. I think the puppet was named Victor. I am not sure. What I know is that it was a tragic piece of theatre. I am not even sure if it was any good really, it was over 10 years ago, but I do remember ugly crying in the dark after feeling uneasy about the text all day.

Now, what makes this memory so poignant for me, is not that it was so sad I cried. It is the fact that this was an after school play and my father drove me to the theatre, which was over an hour and a half away from our home. When my teachers realised that he was going to wait for me in the lobby, as it would make no sense for him to go home and come back, they invited him to come watch the play. He sat next to them while I sat with my friends. And when the play ended, I looked at him, and there he stood, as stoic as usual, tall, stern, as he always was when it came to anything schooling related. We left the theatre. Got to the car. And... He started bawling his eyes out. FLOODS OF TEARS. I tell you it was the weirdest moment for me. I had never seen him cry before. Ever.

He sniffed all the way back home, telling me that it had taken everything he had in him not to cry during the play, that he didn't want to break down in front of my teachers and my friends but that the story was so morbidly sad he couldn't help but cry for the dead puppet. We got home and while he had somewhat regained composure, he told my mother about about it. All excited about having watched something that almost made him cry in public.

I was fourteen years old, and the day of the sad puppet play is the day I realised my unbreakable academic god of a father was just... a normal human who would ugly cry in the dark if given the chance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/svpoh7/is_there_a_piece_of_literature_that_profoundly/,2022-02-18T19:04:21Z,6,18,books,It Ends with Us,POST
hiltvg,Can Infinite Jest be enjoyed thoroughly if I read it on a Kindle?,"Hello everyone,

Sorry for the dumb question. I've always enjoyed reading physical books and have been very resistant to using any E-Readers. And ive anyway not picked up a book in the last 3 years. But with the lockdown in my country (India) not looking to end anytime sooner, Ive decided to pick up reading again with an Kindle I borrowed.

I've always wanted to read Infinite Jest and thought I'll start up with it(Yes i understand its probably not the best book to pick up after a period of rust. But I'm weird like that). I understand that the book has a lot of footnotes and stuff and would require us to constantly move back and forth for more context. So I wanted to know if reading it on a Kindly would make it a hard read? Or it wont make a difference?

7n7ebp,About a year ago I asked r/suggestmeabook to recommend me any book and I’d try to read it in 2017. Here’s how it went.,"First off: SPOILER ALERT!!! I go over major plot points and details in my “reviews.” If you have the desire to read these books without spoilers, I’d recommend stopping!! 
Also, sorry if the format is terrible, I wrote all of this on my iPhone. 


I loved most of the books I was recommended. I was honestly surprised that more people didn’t try to troll me (like the guy that suggested 50 Shades of Grey). I made it explicitly clear that I would try and read anything that was suggested so that was a nice relief. I ended up not reading 2 books that were recommended. One because I had previously read it and another because someone recommended I watch a 10 minute YouTube video to determine which book to read and  that sounded stupid. 

I took the following notes after reading each book. I’m not the greatest book reviewer but I feel like they get slightly better as they go on (for the most part). 

1. Hamilton: Lots of great insight into the founding fathers. Never sure who is actually a good person. Agree more with Jefferson but not how he did things.
6/10

2. The Vegetarian: Super nuts. Not what I expected. Liked first part for setting up madness. Second part got weird but interesting with painters and sex. Third part revealed her illness and why she was that way.
8/10

3. The Blind Assassin: Loved it. Iris' old lady talk got a little boring in the middle but loved the inner book. Suspected iris was writer after she met Alex on the street. Liked the sex scandal towards the end. Didn't see it coming. 
9/10

4. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress: Very interesting. Russian accent was less weird over time. I liked the use of the computer and how it echoed American revolution. Prof was Jefferson and couldn't get what he wanted exactly. Cool sci-fi stuff.
7.5/10

5. A Clockwork Orange: Love the language that he created. Didn't expect that he'd change back at the end. It was fun to discover the meaning of the words as I went along. Really dark stuff.
9/10

6. Milk and Honey: very powerful images. Interesting to follow her story through the poems. Out of my comfort zone, but really enjoyable read. Very quotable. Followed the author on instagram. 
10/10

7. Chronicle of a Death Foretold: interesting and quick read. I liked how all of the events of the day unfolded throughout the book. Loved how you knew what happened at the end in the first sentence. And how the narrator tells you through different perspectives and his own.
9/10

8. Catch-22: Very hard to read for me. The whole thing was a big Abbot and Costello joke that never ended. I liked parts of it (Yossarian's character, the refusal to fly missions, the Catch), but most of it just seemed drawn out and exhausting. I felt like there was no actual plot. There were just characters but barely anything happened. No storyline. I'll give it points for making me laugh a few times though.
5/10

9. The Time Machine: I loved this story. It was thrilling and fun to read. I loved that it was so short too. It gave just the right amount of detail to set the scene really well, but still stay interesting. I liked how humanity split into two different species and how the two were mortal enemies. It's also cool to see how people from our past saw our future. It was cool to read what's considered to be the forerunner of science fiction.
10/10

10. The Lives of Tao: Wow. I had very little expectations for this book and I was blown away. I couldn't put it down. I loved everything about it. It was genuinely funny, a GREAT story, and had such an amazing gimmick. I loved the dialog between tao and roen and the other Prophus/host relationships. What an interesting concept! I loved how it developed and how he trained. I can't say enough good things about this book. It honestly might be one of my favorite books I've ever read. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!
11/10

11. Sons and Lovers: The book started out strong and I really enjoyed the first half of it. I liked how Paul had to struggle between his love for his mother and his love for Miriam/Clara. I didn't like how he never really grew out of it. I wanted him to realize that Miriam was the one for him, but it never came. And I didn't like how he abandoned her for Clara and it wasn't really resolved. Overall it was well written and a good read, but the storyline took some turns that I didn't enjoy.                6/10

12. Sirens of Titan: I really enjoyed reading this book. I went in hearing so much about Vonnegut's writing style so I wasn't sure if I would get it or like it. But it was a lot of fun. I loved the whole futuristic part of the chronosynclastic infundibulum. I didn't expect that Constant and Bea would lose their memories, but I liked how it was done. The fall of Malachi made sense to me and I thought it worked well with the story and added some morality to everything. The ending was a little bittersweet but I liked how everything fell into place. 
10/10

13. The Gene: I learned so much in this book. I loved relearning about Mendel and Darwin. I enjoyed hearing about how the Nazis took the ideas on biologists and completely misunderstood them. Hearing about twin studies and euthanasia they used was really interesting. I also loved how accessible he made the book. I liked the anecdotes about huge discoveries in genetics and the people behind them. The modeling of DNA, recreating insulin, now stem cells and genetic medicine, everything snowballed into what genetics is now. It did get slightly too scientific for me at times, but I don't think it took away from the overall narrative too much. I liked sharing the book with others and it made me feel like a smarter/ better person for reading it.                                           9/10

14. A Head Full of Ghosts: I was excited to read this book because I knew I was going to be reading it while backpacking through Yosemite. I thought it would be fun and creepy to read a scary book out in the wilderness with no lights or society to protect me. Well... unfortunately I didn't find the book very scary. I liked how the book started and how the interview and blog told the story. I liked the relationship between the sisters and their family. I felt like there was a lot of fluff in the middle of the story. I didn't see the point of some of the explanations or stories. I did like how it was written for the majority of the book though. And I liked the ending a lot. The change at the end that made everything her sister went through a little more sinister was awesome. I just didn't think any part of it was scary. It was an interesting read with some good characters and twists, just not a scary book. A little more creepiness would have made the story way better for me.
6/10

15. Notorious RBG: I came into the book thinking that I would like it, but not be crazy about it and I was about right. It seemed more like a playful biography than an intense and gritty one. I felt like it skipped a TON of her life, but gave good summaries of big moments. I think I enjoyed it more because of that, but I also think I missed some interesting stuff in such an incredible woman's life. I definitely learned more about her and about the institutionalized sexism that women have been facing throughout our history. And the stories of her and her husband were really touching and adorable
8/10

16. Welcome to the Monkey House: I'll try and do every story in a separate place. On the whole,  I loved it. Most of it really made me think or laugh a lot. I love his anti war messages and his views on the future. My favorite was probably the title story. Such a cool writer. 
10/10

17. 50 Shades of Grey: so... overall, it's awful. It's nasty, dirty, perverted, and, worst of all, SO POORLY WRITTEN! I can get behind the story a little. I can see how middle aged ladies would get into this. It's erotic fantasy that unfolds in an exciting way. But the writing is just so terrible. It's like the author has never spoken words before. The dialogue is extremely unbelievable. No one speaks like the characters in this book. And the audio book is WORSE! She's like a porn actress, but you don't get to see her naked. Imagine a normal movie filled with porn actors and actresses. So terrible. Also, the ending is one of the worst instances of shitty sequel set ups I've ever read. 25 chapters of nothing happening just so nothing can happen at the end and you're forced to buy 2 more books to get any answers. Such. A. Waste. Of. Time.  I'll give it points for holding some semblance of a plot together in an interesting way. And a few pity points for being funny on accident. I'll take away the rest because it's fucking awful. 
4/10

18. Company: I started out with little expectation for this book. It was hard to find and I figured it wasn't popular because it wasn't very good. I was pleasantly surprised by it. I first started laughing at the waterfall voice mails that came through to everyone. And, when it was revealed to be a fake company, I thought it was a good twist. Overall, I laughed and thought it was pretty well done. I think some things were glossed over a bit, but I'm happy with where it ended. Too much more and I probably wouldn't have been as interested.
8/10

19. A Visit from the Goon Squad: hmmm... not what I expected at all. It felt more like a book of short stories than a novel. I didn't really care for it at first, but the stories and how they were told started to grow on me as they went. I wish that the stories tied together at the end a little better. I wish I could have heard Bosco's story through his or someone's eyes. I feel like it leapt pretty far from Jules' article to the next story without connecting them how the others had been. I also was a little thrown by the last chapter. I didn't see it coming, and didn't really care for the futuristic theme. Overall, I enjoyed the book. I wish some parts were different, but it was still enjoyable.                                                   7/10

20. Dark Matter: woweee! Loved it from the get go. It hooked me in the first chapter and never let up. I loved the science behind it and how everything worked. When he was in Jason2's world, I loved how everyone questioned him and everyone wondered what had happened and maybe he was just crazy. I wasn't totally convinced about most things until they happened in the book. It kept me in great suspense and always delivered an awesome solution. The ending was awesome and I didn't expect a lot of it. All the Jasons really surprised me. I've already recommended it to a ton of people. Absolutely loved it.
10/10

21. My Family and Other Animals: I thought this book was really fun. I loved all of the short stories and characters that were introduced throughout. I didn't realize until I started reading that the setting was so long ago. I didn't research the book much and assumed it was rather new. But I enjoyed reading from a completely different perspective. I also liked that Gerry never spoke in the book. He quoted every other character but himself. I don't know why, but I liked that. I ended up looking up a lot of the animals he mentioned to learn a little bit more about them. Fun book with a lot of really fun stories in it.                                         9/10

22. This Is How You Lose Her: this one grew on me until the last few chapters then kinda fell off again. I didn't really like how it jumped from perspectives and settings at first, but I understood it after a few chapters. I liked reading about yunior and rafa's childhoods. And their stories were interesting and emotional. The last chapter, when Yunior was going over his life after breaking up with his fiancé, brought me back partially, but also lost me in some points. I hated his cheating friend, but it helped me understand more about the bigger picture of the novel. It ended up being a memoir of a cheater and how he and certain events fucked up his love life and real life. Overall, it was entertaining and made me think a lot. 
8/10

23. The Honest Truth about Dishonesty: I learned a lot from this book. I loved reading about all of their experiments and data. I found myself really thinking about how honest I am and how I would perform in each of the experiments. The ones I thought were most interesting were when they were testing the contagiousness of dishonesty. I really wish I could see an additional chapter about the current political situation in the US and how that could affect the nation's morals. I didn't care for the chapter on religion, just because I've been actively non religious for the past decade and I don't think that religion is necessary to be a good and honest person, but I liked that he wrapped it up to be more about rules than anything else. You can have rules without having religion and I like that. Overall, I loved it and I've recommended to several people already!                                              10/10

24. Beer in the Snooker Club: I’m not totally sure how I feel about this book. I feel like nothing really happened... but I didn’t dislike it. It reminded me (partially because the back cover mentioned it) of Catcher in the Rye. I found myself liking Ram less and less as the book went on, but liking the book more. I found it interesting to read about politics I knew absolutely nothing about previously. I understood some of what Ram was going through, with finding himself politically and being an outsider in his family. His status seemed to be a comment on how unfair life can be (and I’m sure it was political) with a lazy, whiny, drunk is able to live in the lap of luxury due to greed and power.
7/10

25. Starship Troopers: awesome! I loved how it started out by setting the scene of the war and the drops. Going back into how Johnnie had decided to join the army and showing his progression through basic training and becoming a trained soldier made for a great storyline. Knowing a little bit about the movie, I expected the whole book to be guns and fighting, but that really only happens a few times throughout. I liked that the book went deep into a lot of stories. I wish that I understood a little bit more about military strategy so I could have better understood the plans at the end, but it was still compelling and I feel like I comprehended enough. I also liked that the author kept referring to actual wars and putting this imaginary one into perspective. The idea of having to serve in the military in order to be a citizen was interesting. I don’t think it would work, and I much preferred the idea of letting scientists run things, but who knows what would be better...? All in all, it was a great read. Heinlein has quickly become a go-to author for me. I’ll definitely be checking out more of his sci-fi in the future.
9/10

26. Lagoon: really well told. I was really interested in it from the start. I like the idea of an alien first interacting with a fish. And I really liked how everything was told. I liked how the narrator knew everything and was able to peek into the minds of all the characters. I didn’t care for a few of the chapters that I felt didn’t really fit. I think those chapters would make more sense if I was familiar with Nigerian myths. I didn’t really ever understand why the aliens came. It never made a ton of sense to me. And in the appendices the author says that she decided to write it after watching district 9 and being annoyed by it. I wish that it had more of a purpose. But I liked how most things played out. I liked that the bad guys got what was coming to them and the good guys one. I didn’t like how the three main characters seemed to randomly have powers though. Overall I had fun reading it, even if I didn’t gather a ton of meaning from everything. 
8/10

27. Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe: cute story. I liked the story from the beginning and I think it was really well told throughout. There were times where I felt that specific details never came back into the plot, but the main story seemed consistent and I liked it. I think it was a little predictable and things worked out a little too perfectly at times, but I’ll chalk that up to the YA category. You could tell right away that the two of them were going to end up together and I was mostly ok with that. There were a few times when I thought the author might surprise me with a twist, but the predictable thing usually ended up happening. I related to the loneliness and troubled family of Ari. It’s good to see characters that deal with their problems in their own ways and I’m glad kids and teens will be able to read this and gain insight. Overall, it was predictable and cheesy, but I liked it a lot. Out of my normal comfort zone but a great and fun read.                                                 9/10

28. The Brothers K: The last book on my list! Took me a while, but I enjoyed it for the most part. I really loved how detailed and nuanced each character was. There wasn’t a character I didn’t enjoy reading about. I thought at one point, though, that too much was happening. Especially with all the brothers in different countries and all with completely different stories going on at the same time. I liked it, but it was just hard to follow all of them at once for me. It also couldn’t have helped that it took me so long to read it. :/ Irwin’s story was my favorite and least favorite at the same time. I loved how innocent he he was and how he tried to be a good person and how he brought his whole family back together. This seems like a book I’ll have to read again to really catch everything, but I definitely enjoyed it.

fw1iai,Easy Book Riddle! See if you can solve it!,"It’s a story of a man who went through hell,
He was locked up in a place we know all too well.

His escape, though, made everyone scared,
To mess with him after what he did, no one dared.

The guards of this place were not very good,
Oh and DO NOT look under their hood! 

For the longest time we hated him so,
But by the end, little did we know.

That it was the creature we thought was a pet,
It was more what this man was trying to get.

Even still no one thought him truthful,
And the villain behind this was anything but ruthful.

In the end it looked very bleak,
The guards had invaded and made us weak.

bu9arn,I just finished “The Ugly American” and loved it!,"I found this book in the depths of the Classics section. It actually looks like it’s never been checked out before. It’s probably new.

This book was published in the 50s by a Navy officer and a political scientist who both lived in Southeast Asia during that time. The US was fighting the Cold War there mostly with diplomacy, foreign aid, and a bit of skirmishing. The book is fiction, but heavily based on real events that the authors witnessed while in Asia.

It has elements of satire when mocking the incompetent American diplomats, and how they screw everything up without anyone being smart enough to realize it. But, I also found the ending deeply troubling, even if it wasn’t very dramatic or even unexpected. I knew that US foreign aid is pretty fucked, but I didn’t realize that at least during that time, the incompetent ones were actively pushing out the competent ones for being nuisances.

“The Ugly American” was on the bestsellers list for more than a year. It was made into a movie a few years later with Marlon Brando. It reportedly inspired Eisenhower to conduct an investigation into foreign aid at the end of his term. John F. Kennedy loved the book. He supposedly mailed a copy of it to every US Senator at the time. He was also inspired by it to start the creation process of what would become the Peace Corps.

Overall, it was definitely a simple read. The people in it were arguably caricatures and generalizations. But, I really liked how blunt it was, and how depressing it was. It definitely made me care a lot more about foreign policy. I also think that it’s political impact seems understated, because no person I’ve talked to so far has read it, nor does anyone seem to know what it’s about. But, it’s effect on both the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations seems obvious.

If you’re interested in politics, like short stories, or if you like a good dramedy, I would definitely recommend it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bu9arn/i_just_finished_the_ugly_american_and_loved_it/,2019-05-29T02:50:25Z,9,8,books,It Ends with Us,POST
14xy6wf,Babel by RF Kuang after I had some time to think it through,"LONG REVIEW AHEAD 

I read Babel by RF Kuang a couple of months back after hearing very high praise. Right after finishing the book, it hovered over a 4-star read for me because I tend to enjoy nerdy stuff like etymology and youth rebellion.

However, I had some time to think about it and my appreciation for the novel is dimming by the day. Just to make it clear, I am a person of colour from a former British colony and have read about British atrocities in detail as a Humanities student so I would consider myself duly informed about colonialism and more specifically, how it impacted my culture and history. 

While reading the book, (as I mentioned before) the nerdy stuff kept me engaged but I was having a hard time with the pacing which I couldn't immediately figure out why. In hindsight, it was definitely the author's filibuster. I would argue that even that was done a bit subtly and I couldn't catch it right away but the constant lecturing on the author's own beliefs (which were as layman as 'war/racism bad') made it way longer than it needed to be. The characters did not have as much dimension as I would have appreciated which I attribute to them being used as the author's mouthpieces. This rubs me the wrong way as I do not really enjoy being patronised as a reader. I believe authors should have faith in their audience for being intelligent enough to form their own opinion and not just create an echo chamber through literature. 

The part that rubbed me off the worst was the Ball scene where both Letty and Victoire were harassed and Letty was so conveniently dubbed ignorant while these three characters stood as insensitive as ever to her harassment. Even Victoire didn't really speak for her and that just made me see the obvious cracks in their supposed friendship.

Also the author's alienation of Letty because 'you cannot empathise with us because you haven't lived as we did' seemed BS, you cannot just be excluding people and actively make them not be an ally. You cannot just live in a bubble in the name of cultural solidarity and be a jerk to everyone who doesn't align with your exact beliefs because their livid experiences are different from yours. At that, Letty wasn't even racist or a bad person overall, she just couldn't relate to her friends' experiences as people of colour but why must she be punished for that? And yes, her friends tried making her understand but then the author took it upon herself to declare that she couldn't just because. And the echo chamber reverberates again. 

The part about the war and everything took me out honestly. It seemed like these bunch of students assumed themselves well equipped in a very condescending manner. I'd take the liberty of comparing it to ethnic people who set up their life abroad and then talk about saving their homeland, all performatively, as if the people who choose to run it and bear the brunt of power imbalance are subordinates. It gave the impression that these Westernised students thought themselves to just be better. 

I also think the part about respecting Ramy's religion but not Letty's was done very deliberately in a poor attempt to appear woke. I understand the punching up and down bit but it really did not make sense to me. Is respecting a religion necessary only if it interacts with your culture also? (I'm agnostic btw and while I respect everyone who chooses to follow their religion without forcing it upon others, this blatant difference just caught me a bit off.) 

Then comes 'The Necessity Of Violence'. This stuff sounds good poetically but in my opinion, holds exactly zero nuance. Yes, violence plays a part in power relations and privileges and rights but it doesn't thrive in exclusivity. There is a plethora of (sometimes unimaginable) factors that weigh into the social machinery and establishing violence as an end all be all looks like a lazy attempt to me personally. 

Lastly, the final quarter of the book was so hastily done. I did not really understand what the destruction of the tower really achieved. It was mentioned how it will inconvenience the colonisers but they can still exercise their power and that just baffles me because why won't you just put more thought into making your rebellion worth the sacrifice and have it be sustainable? 

&#x200B;

Above were the points that I found wrong with the book. There are of course some things that I found interesting and which also resonated with me. I related to the parts where Robin felt so strongly for his homeland but had a moral dilemma when it came to parting with immoral luxury. RF Kuang undoubtedly writes well and the subtle magic system seemed interesting. 

Now, Babel stands at 3.5 stars for me.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Babel lacked nuance and while there were some good elements in the book, the condescending nature of narration really brought the show down for me.

vevdb4,"Just finished God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. Vonnegut does it again.","As always, I’m left picking up a shattered brain left in a thousand pieces after reading anything Kurt Vonnegut.

This is the 9th book I’ve read by him (working through them as slowly as possible to delay the inevitable tragic day when I run out of new books to read), and I think it ranks as one of the best ones I’ve read, behind Breakfast of Champions, Slaughterhouse 5, and Mother Night.

Just need to brain vomit my thoughts and would love to discuss (spoilers):

* Unlike any of his other novels that I’ve read, the theme of the book is SMASHED upon your head on every page from the beginning of the book. Not the usual mysterious way of trying to find out what point he’s trying to make, but it works perfectly fine for this book. 
* Also the only semi-heartwarming book I’ve read by Kurt so far? If you can call it that. He still finds a way to break your heart in the end. When the “click” happens and he forgets how to be nice to the pitiful citizens of Rosewater, man that hurt. The way they absolutely 100% knew he wasn’t coming back to Rosewater, God. 
* The way he quickly describes the characters he passes on the way out of Rosewater (i.e. the nazi sympathizer, the impregnated teenager), so damn good. And the janitor/ex-convict guy that can “see” the click in his eyes the second he sees him. \*chef’s kiss\*. He just has a way of making you want to know more about the most minor characters. Like the rich Buntline girl who sells porn to other kids.
* Eliot Rosewater might be my favorite Vonnegut character ever. He’s so pitiful and lovable. The fact that he’s such a good person while being an alcoholic slob, just makes it so real I guess. 
* I hate that you don’t find out what happens to him and Sylvia, the only person who makes him feel vulnerable and emotional and sad. That conversation they have is so fucking heartbreaking. It’s so simple but you can tell they care about each other, but are tiptoe-ing anything that would break the dam.

“Eliot—?”  
“Yes?”  
“How is everybody?”  
“Here?”  
“Anywhere.”  
“Fine.”  
“I’m glad.”

“If—if I ask about certain people, I’ll cry,” said Sylvia.  
“Don’t ask.”  
“I still care about them, even if the doctors tell me I mustn’t ever go there again.”  
“Don’t ask.”  
“Somebody had a baby?”  
“Don’t ask.”  
“Who had a baby, Eliot?—I care, I care.”  
“Oh Christ, don’t ask.”

* I kinda loved Fred Rosewater too. So pathetic with the scabs on his shins. Like when he freaks out over his ancestors, and then brings his wife down to read the ancestry book with him, and then sees that bugs ate through the book, and he calmly decides to kill himself. I laughed out loud. Such typical, cynical Kurt humor.
* Uncurling foot-long pubes
* Harry Pena, the most virile man in Pisquontuit with the most virile name.
* The fact that he finishes the book in a tennis outfit is hilarious to me. 
* I’ll say it every time I finish a Vonnegut book. The Vonnegut Universe of characters blows my mind every time I run into a character from another book. Better than anything Marvel will ever put together.

Random quotes:

* “I mean insistence that the truth be told about this sick, sick society of ours, and that the words for the telling could be found on the walls of restrooms.”
* “‘I’d ask you to name the rock-bottom price you’d charge to go on living for just one more week.’ There was silence.” (On the phone with a suicidal stranger)
* “Coffee and Danish, Mr. Rosewater?” Said the not-very-clean idiot girl behind the counter.
* “I can’t help thinking people are going to *think* you’re crazy for paying so much attention to people like us.”

*Poo-tee-weet?*

bx1021,Just read A Seperate Peace by John Knowles- surprised by how divisive it seems to be,"I recently decided that I was going to read the high school 'staples' that I never read in school, such as *1984* and *Frankenstein.* As the title states, a couple of weeks ago I finished John Knowles' classic piece of YA fiction, *A Seperate Peace.* Personally, I loved it. The characters felt very real, and the story of being lost in your own world and problems while the world was falling apart around you, slowly encroaching on the life you knew is a classic tale of youth. The desperate attempt to hold onto the life you knew before being thrust into adulthood is universal and poweful. The friendship, and possible romance, between Finny and Gene is emotional and beautiful, and when the book ends the journeys of both characters directly reflects the themes the novel has been building upon.

Usually after I finish reading a book, any piece of media, really, I look online to see what others thought. To my surprise, the book was highly divisive. Many people despise this book, and it surprised me. 

SPOILERS FOLLOW

The biggest criticisms seem to be about how unrelatable the characters and their problems are. They are rich, priviledged white boys who are effectively avoiding WW2 by going to a private school. While yes, the setting is something most of us have never and will never see, that does not invalidate the central message, being robbed of one's youth and being thrust into adulthood, whether they are ready or not. The idea that books have to be relatable to have value is  an school of thought that I dislike. While the story may not be 'relatable' on a surface level, the theme is universal. At one point or another, we have to grow up. It happens at different times for all of us, as it does for all of us. The character that represents eternal youth, Finny, was damaged at the end of summer, and by the end of winter he is dead, effectively ending Gene's childhood and bringing him into adulthood.

When I started reading the novel, I knew absolutely nothing about it. So when it came to Finny and Gene's relationship, I was surprised by how homoerotic it was. Personally, I read it with a queer theory lense, and to me that really enhanced my reading experience. Gene constantly wrestles with his feelings for Finny. He does not understand if he is a friend or a rival, but Gene feels a strong pull toward him, and ultimately succumbs to Finny's endless charms. This wrestling of emotions during a time of great change.is something I imagine young LGBTQ+ people deal with constantly. Especially at a time where gay relationships were uncommon, Gene's entanglement with Finny being something he cannot put into words becomes much more powerful. He feels somwthing for Finny that he cannot understand, and this causes him to act irrationally. Whether or not you see the relationship as romantic or platonic, it is a striking one, and it is undeniable how Gene's love and loss of Finny is what causes him to fall into his cold, depressing adulthood. 

So yeah, just a few unfocused thought on *A Seperate Peace.* I am curious to see what r/books has to say about it. As is probably clear, I loved it, and a few tears my have been shed at the sudden death of Finny... but enough about that. What do you guys think? I'd love to see what you guys think, and hopefully have a discussion with you all about our thoughts, because love it or hate it I think it's a book worth talking about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bx1021/just_read_a_seperate_peace_by_john_knowles/,2019-06-05T10:23:38Z,7,24,books,It Ends with Us,POST
78ycgl,"When you receive a book as a gift, read it next!","The holiday season is approaching and for many of us, that will mean giving and receiving books as presents. When I send someone a book, I put a shit ton of time into selecting the right one, because I believe gifting a book should be intimate. It takes real time and effort to pick out a book they haven't read, one that may challenge them but not so much that they will put it down, or one that aligns with what they like to read without being overt or thoughtless. And at the end of that, nothing is more frustrating than checking in about how they enjoyed the book to find that they barreled right into something else. 

I don't think you have to love the book, or even like it, and I certainly wouldn't expect anyone to drop what they are reading and start it asap. But if someone gives you a book, read it next!

jyslyu,Just finished “Sunday at the Pool in Kigali” by Gil Courtemanche. It destroyed me.,"It’s a historical fiction novel based on real characters and the Rwandan Genocide in 1994. It was originally published in French. I read the English translation. 

A few years back, I read the nonfiction, “We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families” by Philip Gourevitch. Which is a very well-known depiction of the genocide and its aftermath. I suggest this account if you wish to familiarize yourself with the factual account of the tragedy.

Back to “Sunday”: While I wasn’t crazy about the main romantic relationship, I also understood the author’s need to give his protagonist a reason to stay despite the outbreak of war. The book has some cringey sexual references leading into                                        r/menwritingwomen territory. I can’t speak to the sexual norms of those in Rwanda at the time, nor the  rampant use and abuse of sex workers by many of the NGO and aid workers, but it doesn’t surprise me if it’s indeed true. There’s a particular scene where a prostitute has sex with a man dying of AIDS in front of all those surrounding him as he prepares to pass. Despite the way it sounds, it was written with compassion. There is quite a bit of gratuitous sex in the book, but I think the author is showing us how sex for pleasure was vital in keeping people from focusing on their impeding doom, either through AIDS or the looming massacre. 

I’m a political scientist, so I’ve studied Rwanda, genocide, and ethnic cleansing throughout my career. But the author was not only successful in demonstrating the complexities of the conflict, but also highlighting the AIDS epidemic that was also ravaging much of the population at the time. 

Despite the utter horror of the situation, the author  humanized his characters and explained the many of the moral ambiguities found in Rwanda during the early nineties. 

The book will frustrate and, perhaps even, shame you a bit. And the ending will gut you. It made me question everything about the human condition, and what it means to truly live even in the face of imminent death. 
I will add that I cried for 45 minutes after finishing it. 


Anyone else read this book and have interesting thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jyslyu/just_finished_sunday_at_the_pool_in_kigali_by_gil/,2020-11-22T08:52:51Z,14,132,books,It Ends with Us,POST
obtlws,Is this sentence from The Golden Bowl as confusing as I think it is?,"Many of the sentences from The Golden Bowl are exactly as confusing as I think they are, but this one in particular seems like it simply has an extra word in it.

>""Do you know what I'm really thinking of?"" \[Maggie\] asked...  
>  
>\[Her father\]... \[arrived\] at it. *""Why, of your finding her at last yourself a husband.""*

They've been speaking of Charlotte, Maggie's unmarried friend. Maggie has asked her father to write to Charlotte and invite her to stay with them a while, but has been careful to assure her father, a widower, that she's not trying to set them up. Maggie herself has just been married recently, and she's worried that now that his only daughter has been married off that there will be a societal pressure for her widowed father to marry again.

It seems to me if the word ""yourself"" were excised from the above sentence, then what is expressed would be that Maggie wants to personally find her friend Charlotte a husband. I suppose even if it remains in the sentence, it could be merely there to emphasize the ""your;"" that is, Maggie's apparent desire to find her \[Charlotte\] a husband personally.

That's the most logical reading of the sentence, but there are others. (The previous chapter literally ends with ""There'll be others,"" and the previous chapter itself is filled, absolutely cram-jammed, with pronouns referring ambiguously to several possible antecedents.) The narrator has even gone as far as to refer to Maggie herself as being ""married"" to her father — not literally but in the sense of having a dependent relationship with him that precludes the possibility of his marrying anyone else. The illogical mis-reading of ""finding... yourself a husband,"" as in, ""discovering that you are yourself a husband (and not a wife)"" seems to be among the many candidates for misreading the sentence.

Further confusing the issue are the circumstances of plot: as described above, Maggie has a notion that her father will be pressured to remarry; also, unknown to her but known to the reader, her own husband had courted Charlotte. Thus it's not even immediately clear who ""your,"" ""her,"" and ""husband"" refers to.

Henry James has us work hard — we must really attend to the novel — to even understand who is being referred to and what is being discussed, and our understanding is constantly interrupted by prepositional phrases, almost like verbal tics, such as that ""at last"" — which even confusingly comes in the middle of the sentence instead of, y'know, at the end! So that ""last"" is not the last.

It's as though every sentence, every syntactic unit, is artfully arrayed to disrupt the flow, the experience of breezy reading — to undermine our sense that the world and life is naturally coherent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/obtlws/is_this_sentence_from_the_golden_bowl_as/,2021-07-01T19:47:12Z,3,2,books,It Ends with Us,POST
77y09s,"I just finished ""Never Let Me Go,"" and it tore me apart.","Today I finished ""Never Let Me Go"", and I think the book broke me. It was beautiful. Every single facet of the story had multiple layers to explore. For example, Kathy and Ruth were on the surface shown to be foils of each other. Ruth was shown as selfish and attention-hungry, while Kathy portrayed herself as an innocent bystander dragged along with Ruth's domineering personality. But, I realized, we see the entire story from Kathy's perspective, giving us privileged access to her internal monologue that rationalized her every action, which forcibly biased the book towards her. If you look at what she actually said and did, her and Ruth don't seem all that different. And at the end, when Ruth finally admits to keeping Tommy and Kathy apart, you realize that Ruth also had a rich internal life, and that if the book was written from Ruth's perspective, it wouldn't be all that different (see [sonder](http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/23536922667/sonder), a word I've always loved).

Even more directly, it's amazing the book worked as well as it did. There was no plot, and the entire book was just first person recollections of a strange, alien world. The story itself was told non-linearly and weaved back and forth across time and characters: it was as close as you'll get to stream-of-consciousness in science fiction, and it ended at the beginning. And yet, it's incredibly compelling. Ishiguro has this way of portraying memory and time that almost makes the reader nostalgic for the memories of the character. By the end, I felt like the donor Kathy described in the first chapter, where I could remember being at Hailsham, and growing up with collections and Sales and the Gallery and Miss Lucy and Miss Geraldine and the rest. 

I cried at the end. The image of Kathy there, staring at the open field, crying and hoping for Tommy to appear in the distance, just tore me apart. It brought me back to when my grandmother died, and my mom's expression at her funeral: the emptiness in her eyes as she stared at the urn of ashes. Kathy was the last of the three, and in the end, she was alone, marching to her inevitable fate. And I guess that's the last big theme of the book: that there's no escape, and there's no point to run. Because even if Kathy tried to run, the world would continue marching on. Clones would be bred and sacrificed, and the new ones wouldn't have the benefits of Hailsham. They wouldn't be cultured or independent - in many ways, they wouldn't even be human. In some way, I think the running motif of Hailsham students feeling guilty for their privileges came to head at the end, when they all realized that there was nothing truly special about them, and they all were destined to naught. (This actually struck me as a great parallel to Blade Runner, and someday I want to do a Never Let Me Go - Blade Runner comparison.)

I'll end this ramble with that striking image of Kathy standing in her dorm room, holding the pillow, and swaying along to Judy Bridgewater's ""Never Let Me Go."" Kathy had the innocent imagining of her holding a baby, hoping it would never let her go, but Madame had a much wider understanding of that moment. She thought it was Kathy holding onto the fragments of an old world that was falling from her grasp, like sand between your fingertips, but she still tried, holding on to what she could. It was the eternal struggle of science and efficiency against our own humanity, and in Ishiguro's world, humanity lost. I don't think it's not too far from our own reality.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/77y09s/i_just_finished_never_let_me_go_and_it_tore_me/,2017-10-22T03:31:11Z,19,59,books,It Ends with Us,POST
o19i4c,Just finished “The Fever” by Megan Abbott and loved it! [spoilers],"K I’ve tried to post on this sub before and the auto mod thing always comes after me for not being meaty enough. So I’m going to try to prompt discussion here in a meaningful way cause I LOVED this book and really want to talk about it. 

The book centers on one family’s experience when girls start becoming mysteriously ill at one high school. High schooler Deenie is friends with the first girls to become ill. Her father Tom teaches at the school, and her older brother Eli also attends. The books moves between POVs of various characters, and a lot is hidden until the end when *all is revealed* I thought this was a useful device for pacing the narrative, and also added a lot of richness to the story with so many perspectives to explore. 

I liked a lot about this book. As a psych nerd the focus on the internal experience of the characters was very interesting to me. I was gripped from the beginning not only to figure out the mystery but also to better understand who the characters were and why they did what they did. The social contagion aspect of the story was well done and seemed realistic. I hate a book that seems grounded in reality until the very end when some weird sci-fi fantasy explanation is given. 

I also loved the nuanced relationship dynamics that were explored. I thought Abbott showed complexity in areas that often feel one-note. The book didn’t fall into “high school girl friendship” tropes, “teen sibling” clichés, or “children of divorce” melodrama. 

I’m still sort of unpacking the themes, but the obvious big one is about unexplained/unexplainable change. And about how events or forces that we aren’t aware of or don’t have control over shape us. I liked the description of Deenie’s mom’s change, the lake, Lise, the weather— I thought the book was poetic in the way it described these ideas without being stuffy/pedantic/inaccessible. 

I also thought it was interesting what the characters knew and didn’t know about each other. What characters chose to share and what they struggled with alone. 

I’m definitely adding Abbott’s other novels to my list. What did others think of The Fever? Where should I go next from Abbott?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o19i4c/just_finished_the_fever_by_megan_abbott_and_loved/,2021-06-16T16:55:31Z,6,3,books,It Ends with Us,POST
8lgpzo,The Epic of Gilgamesh was complete garbage for me... until it became awesome.,"So... spoiler alert for the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, if I even need one for a four thousand year old story.

I started reading the *Epic of Gilgamesh* a while ago and... it wasn't really all that great. It was kinda cool to see the traditions that surrounded Uruk and the ancient Middle East, and it was super cool to see Noah's story basically retold detail-for-detail in the form of Utnapishtim, but, other than that, I was fairly disappointed.

...Until the last two pages. For some backstory, Gilgamesh has just lost the plant that will ""rejuvenate"" him. Effectively, he has lost the plant that will grant him immortality, the thing that he's been questing for, and the only thing that he desires in the whole world. Gilgamesh has failed his quest. As he walks back to his home city, Uruk, he points to it and tells his walking partner, Ur-shanabi the boatman, something:

>When they arrived in Uruk-the-Sheepfold,

>Said Gilgamesh to him, to Ur-shanabi the boatman:

>'O Ur-shanabi, climb Uruk's walls and walk back and forth!

>Survey its foundations, examine the brickwork!

>Were its bricks not fired in an oven?

>Did the seven Sages not lay its foundations?

>'A square mile is city, a square mile date-grove, a square mile is

>clay pit, half a square mile the temple of Ishtar:

>three square miles and a half is Uruk's expanse.'

The End. That is the final thing that Gilgamesh says, and it's the final thing on the final tablet of our source for the *Epic of Gilgamesh.* So... what did he mean?

Gilgamesh, at this point in the story, is utterly defeated. He has decided that there is no point in life, because life will inevitably end. But, in the last moments of his journey, he decides to talk about the walls of his city. In some traditions, Gilgamesh is the one who built those walls, but the meaning of his words doesn't change much if that isn't true.

Gilgamesh has decided to remark upon the walls because he has decided that *they* will be the source of his immortality. Either by the fact that he built them, or that he would be the one to defend them, or that he would be the one to bring prosperity to the walled city's inhabitants, *that* would be the meaning of his life. He decides that his immortality would not be literal, but through his deeds he would be remembered.

*Gilgamesh* is the story of a demigod *almost* succeeding, *almost* slaying enough monsters and demons and gods and goddesses to get everything and the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. But then, at the last moment, he understands that the rainbow doesn't have an ending. In the end, Gilgamesh comes to grips with his own humanity, and that has to resonate with us, those with our own mortalities.

The student in me feels obliged to list my sources:

rrs2ni,"Rabbits by Terry Miles -- I enjoyed it, but I didn't like it","I received *Rabbits* by Terry Miles as a Christmas gift, and I have some thoughts. To start, I did not think incredibly highly of it, but I didn’t hate it. It was a little below average, maybe 4/10 if I had such a scale. I think the concept is wonderful, but the execution fell flat. This is, to me, a frustrating book because it threatens to be great, but can’t fulfill its promise.

I will be discussing spoilers and my interpretation of the book, but if you don’t want to hear that then I will just say that I thought the characters were very flat, the prose was underwhelming, and the general structure of the book was flimsy. There were, however, a lot of great ideas and, had they been better developed and foreshadowed, this could have made for a great novel. Despite my complaints, I still finished it, and I enjoyed it unironically.

###Summary

*Rabbits* is a 2021 novel by Terry Miles, published by Del Rey Books. It is the story of K, a textually gender-ambiguous character with an eidetic memory who is invested in a world-spanning alternate reality game called Rabbits. Rabbits, the game, is going into its eleventh iteration, and threatens to unravel the universe if it’s not fixed before then. Pop culture carries a heavy load for the story, and though I have not read *Ready Player One* I have seen people compare it to this book in how often it seeks to make references. Personally, I am put off by that sort of thing in stories as it feels trite to let another story do the emotional labour for your own, but here it didn’t feel unwarranted.

The game of Rabbits is played by looking for discrepancies and clues in the real-world, noticing patterns and deducing meaning from them. The game is super underground and people are almost afraid to talk about it out loud. It can be a dangerous game. Some people die playing it, and it is not for the faint of heart. If there are rules to the game, though, no one knows what they are, and whatever information we have about it has been cobbled together from personal experiences and second-hand accounts.

Our hero K has been following Rabbits since (I think) the sixth iteration of the game, and she helps introduce prospective players to the idea of it at weekly meetings. When a reclusive billionaire named Alan Scarpio appears at one such meeting and asks for her help to fix the game, she is floored, but before she can begin to assist him he disappears. K (with the assistance of her friends Chloe and Baron) then tasks herself with finding the missing billionaire, leading to her drifting through the dimensions of the multiverse, strong opinions about Jeff Goldbloom, supernatural horrors, quantum computers, prenatal drugs, and a whole lot of media references.

In short, K learns that she has the ability to tap into what are known as Radiants—kind of quantum ley lines that run through the multiverse and which can be used to make small alterations to the fabric of reality, which can then greatly affect the real world. The game Rabbits has been a way of controlling these mystical Radiants for as long as the universe has existed, but now a big bad corporate daddy is recklessly destroying them for personal profit. This is bad, because it’s probably going to end the universe and kill everyone in it. But in the end K manages to win the game, saving world and earning herself infinite money and her “heart’s desire”.

###Thoughts

Okay, so what do I mean, K is “textually gender-ambiguous”? Post-launch, the author has come out and said that K is female (and apparently the audiobook narrator for this first-person story is female, too). I find this really frustrating, because although I earnestly believe the author when he says he intends for K to be female, and there are references in the novel which can be interpreted as giving credence to the notion that K is female, her gender is never actually addressed in the novel. I don’t think it’s bad to purposely not gender your characters when it doesn’t in any way impact the story, but I’m disappointed for two reasons.

The first is that the author consciously chose to make a queer character but did not have the wherewithal to make that distinction rise to the level of text. If he wanted to keep K’s gender ambiguous, that would have been fine, but to come out after the fact and say, yeah, she is a she, well, I don’t know, that just kind of frustrates me. The author could have had a nice bit of representation embedded in the actual text, or he could have preserved the ambiguity of the character, but instead he did neither.

The second is that I think an ambiguous character is much stronger here because, spoilers, I believe the entire thing to be taking place inside a quantum computer known as the Byzantine Game Engine. Like K’s gender, the ending of the novel doesn’t draw a lot of attention to itself. No one comes out and says, “Yep, it was a video game!” but, to me, the ending seemed very clear that K is a player (likely a tester) in Sidney Farrow’s The Door is Open, and is inside the BGE, which is stated to be capable of creating impossible alterations of reality in video and audio formats (not to mention every playthrough being different and backfilling all information to make the game world seem authentic). I believe this is supported by the text, and it carries the overall theme of the story about the nature of reality and perception of reality being delusive and unknowable.

Anyway, I think having an ambiguous character works more strongly for this story, as it really plays up the idea that you can be anyone in video games, and you don’t have to be beholden to who or what you were born as. So, really, it’s my fault for reading outside the text because, as it’s left in the book, I think it was well done.

My two biggest problems with the story were the hollow characters and the story’s messy structure. The characters were almost entirely blank, without much personality. K and Chole, who take up the majority of the scenes, felt especially empty to me. As an example, Chole was said to have written a famous song ten years earlier and was still living on the royalties for it. I think there may have been one point in the story where Chloe played a guitar or something, but other than that there was no indication to me that she had any interest in music. Except for K, most characters felt that way—as if they were empty shells waiting to play Rabbits. And even K didn’t have much of a personality, but because it was told in first-person point of view her perspective carried more personality than the secondary characters.

I think part of this could have been intentional, as K and Chloe (and most people who play Rabbits) are painted as game addicts who do little else outside of the game. That’s a fine idea, but I think it would be a weak justification to do it as the characters were written in the book. Who you were before today still affects who you are, and it informs how you think, and speak, and feel, and none of that came across for any character in the novel. It feels like all the characters are constructed this way, as if they’re mouthpieces to advance the plot. They don’t even really want anything, and there’s no real friction between them. K and Chloe don’t even seem to particularly want to win Rabbits for most of the novel.

And that’s partially where the structure struggled for me. It felt like a lot of the novel was sitting in someone’s apartment, looking at old movies, or listening to songs, or playing games with the intention of looking for clues and discrepancies to push the game forward. For a novel that is purported to be a thriller, there weren’t many thrilling scenes. Characters found something, went to a place, found something else, then went to another place until they came back to the apartment to talk about it; or else they hit a dead end and only later (and often without prompting) they remembered something they had missed the first time. There was almost never a clear sense of progression to where the clues were leading, or even what direction the story was heading. A large part of this, I think, might have been the lack of stakes for most of the book. It’s not until we’re nearing the ending that we realize the whole world might end, and before that the stakes weren’t readily apparent to me.

Even when K is having blackouts and losing time, she and Chloe keep playing, and several times throughout the novel Chloe is like, maybe we shouldn’t be doing this? But then they go on doing it anyway, and it’s kind of just glossed over that K might be ODing on the Mandela Effect. I, as a reader, didn’t really feel a sense of danger or scope for what these blackouts might have meant for K. Part of that is the stakes, but I think it’s also a problem with characterization. I just didn’t feel an attachment to anyone, so when K might die it was more just casual curiosity that kept me reading.

I think if the characters were better developed the story could have been so much more.

And maybe that best states how I feel about the book in general: it could have been so much more. There was an interesting set up, but the book needed another few developmental drafts to get it ready for publishing. There’s one character who shows up, known as Swan, who seems to at first be working for the bad guy, Crow, but later is revealed to be in opposition to him. Neither of them really get a resolution to their storyline, and just disappear after the false climax. K’s friend and ally Baron dies after some bizarre stuff straight out of *The Ring*, and his death is never really ‘solved’ or given meaning. In the last twenty or thirty pages of the book, Emily says some truly buck wild shit about being married to K before disappearing at the end of the novel. The Magician, a squandered character who is something of a guide and mentor for K and Chloe, disappears in the middle of the book and then is shown to be literally murdered on a years-old film reel, before K learns in the denouement that, “Nah, he’s fine; don’t worry about it.” Hazel, a character who previously won an iteration of Rabbits and seems like a mythical figure who gets a blurb at the start of a lot of the early chapters and who the novel seems to be building towards as an ally or villain, is never explicitly revealed, and when the members of the Circle are displayed at the end her spot is now vacant, which I still don’t understand. Alan Scarpio, the person who kicks this whole thing off, reappears at the end of the novel and is just making waffles, and doesn’t really offer a convincing explanation of how or why they’re there. The supernatural horrors of the Grey God, these shadowy things that seem to live between dimensions and which appear throughout the story to threaten people and literally murder the Magician are minimalized by Scarpio in the denouement and never given literal meaning or an explanation.

There’s just a lot of things like that in the book, which make me think the book could have benefited from more drafting to bring these disparate elements together to strengthen the climax and themes of the story.

Similarly, the plot elements involving the Moonrise and the Horns of Terzos kind of get resolved, but I still don’t entirely understand the purpose of the Horns of Terzos either, because it didn’t seem to do anything. In the novel, K and Chloe find out about a book published fifty years earlier called the Horns of Terzos, which is essentially a map/plan for the final act of the story. They have to go to three places and then defeat the “man in the Tower” (who is Crow). In our story, K and Chloe follow the points marked on the map, but nothing really happens at these places, then suddenly K is in an elevator going up the Tower to confront Crow. The points on the map didn’t have any purpose. The characters didn’t find anything, or have any confrontations, they just passed through those places like slalom skiers hitting their gates so they could rebound to the next ones.

One thing I thought of to explain the ‘surreal’ nature of the story is that its structure is an artifact of the game/world K is in—it is, after all, a place of discrepancies and dimensional drift, where things aren’t what they seem. The theme of the story itself seems to be the instability of reality, so maybe things don’t have to resolve properly, or have the same kind of meaning and structure that normal stories do in that place. But then I thought, no, if that is the case it’s still a bad choice because it detracts from the enjoyment of the novel, and, worse, it doesn’t even make diegetic sense because the Byzantine Game Engine is supposed to be incredible at creating stories and characters. So, regardless of the reasons the book ended up the way it did, I still think that a lot of the ideas fell flat in the author’s execution of the second half of the book.

There seemed to be a lot of weight put into the theme of perception and the nature of reality, but I felt that they weren’t very well explored, and they didn’t help to shape the climax, or allow for the story to pose many insightful questions. As I mentioned before, Emily starts saying some crazy things at the end of the novel, namely that K is her wife and that K doesn’t remember because she’s spent four years moving through dimensions and has forgotten where she really came from. This could have made for a really interesting conflict for K, who has fallen in love with Chloe. After all, what is the nature of love? Can K be in love with Chloe, who maybe isn’t real? Can K love Emily if she doesn’t remember her? When her memories begin to return to her, K explains that the sensations feel real enough, but does that matter if you don’t remember it?

But the idea didn’t work for me because although Emily was established early in the book she is hardly given any scenes with K, and when they do have scenes together there is no hint of an emotional reaction from either of them, save maybe one kiss when they’re both teenagers (but even that didn’t feel particularly emotional; it felt like kids figuring out what feelings are). There isn’t even a real conflict of ideas on the theme of what it means to forget, as K is pretty ready to accept that Emily is her wife and within only a couple of pages is joking about not remembering. But then that’s dropped anyway because Chloe shows back up in the denouement and K is just cool with that again, completely forgetting about her maybe-wife without any hint of hesitation or doubt that her lover might not be real.

Perhaps I haven’t had time to properly digest the story’s meaning yet, but I think the emptiness of the themes really relates back to the shallowness of the characters. No one believes in anything, and K and Chloe don’t even really want anything except to follow the mystery of Alan Scarpio’s disappearance, which they don’t even have a reason for other than its peculiarity. It’s only late in the novel where they adopt the position of “win the game, save the world,” but there isn’t any thematic clash between them and Crow, who is the clearest villain of the story.

Despite being about the perception of reality, the book constantly stops short of ever examining what it means to exist, and I think it suffers for it. I wish the author had done more to interrogate the concept of reality, like what does it mean for K that Chloe might not be real? What does it mean that the life K knows might all be a lie? What does it mean to be deluded?

Similarly, I was really disappointed that the author didn’t play with the pop culture references themselves, and take the time to make up or embellish references that were played straight as being real for K (and therefore us). It seemed like a very natural device to use in a book about the Mandela Effect and the nature of our perception that even the reader should be confused by the end of the book. But, if the author did that, then credit where it’s due, because I firmly believed all of the pop culture references I read and was disappointed that none of them became more ridiculous and less believable as the story went on.

I also thought the conflict with Crow could have made for an interesting meditation on the idea of grief and loss, but it wasn’t fleshed out enough to really be read that way. K’s parents died when she was younger and that makes her a counterpoint to Crow, who has also lost his family (Crow’s main motivation for messing with the Radiants is to bring back his daughter and wife who seem to have been lost because of his earlier experimentations with the Radiants). Emily, likewise, lost her sister because of her and K’s exploration of Rabbits, and she also had to carry that grief with her for her whole life. Where Crow’s grief is tireless and inexorable, though, K’s and Emily’s grief is much more focused on love than only the pain of loss. But despite these parallels to their loss which are all tied back somewhat to Rabbits itself, that is essentially where the theming ends, and K, Emily, and Crow never see their personal philosophies of grief—or what it means to lose people in what might be a counterfeit reality—come into conflict.

As a final point, I would like to talk about the nature of conspiracy. As I was reading this book, it became impossible for me to ignore the way that K and Chloe played the game, finding abstract cracks in the world and filling them in with their own meaning. In the novel, these clues and patterns are always filled in with what is presented as the correct meaning, as it leads to another clue and the game continues. I found it an almost haunting reminder of these last five years and the rise of things like QAnon and flat earth movements which play very similar (if more disorganized) games, looking at the world through a too-narrow scope for anything that might be construed as a pattern or a clue to the true nature of the universe, then using that manufactured meaning to more solidly shape their own isolated worlds. In that way, this book seemed darkly critical of our society—a society which has become so obsessed with pop history and science that even our reasonable assumptions and concrete observations about the world are able to be challenged to the point where people think it’s reasonable to live their lives by the patterns of clouds.

Anyway, given all my complaints, I must say that I still finished the book, and, despite how much I have written that might seem negative, I enjoyed it. I found *Rabbits* compelling. Part of that compulsion may have been a mounting frustration as the wheels fell off the story, but I still liked what it was trying to do.

I will probably recommend *Rabbits* to a few close friends because I am really curious what they’ll think, but I don’t think I would recommend it to strangers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rrs2ni/rabbits_by_terry_miles_i_enjoyed_it_but_i_didnt/,2021-12-30T04:09:15Z,12,40,books,It Ends with Us,POST
3sxmpt,"Times up! One year ago, I posted about my desire to dive into reading by making it through 12 books in 12 months. Here's how it went.","[My original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2mdua9/i_dont_read_much_anyway_and_i_have_a_bad_tendency/)

This post is very long, feel free to skip to the end.  

**The Plan:**  Choose 12 books that I will read within 12 months of beginning, and hope that doing so will finally propel me to become a regular reader. (Some of the books ended up being dropped from the list and replaced if I started them and didn't like them or if I just decided I didn't want to read them at this time)

**The Books (in no particular order) and why I chose them:**  
•	Snow Crash - Neal Stephenson - reddit's top sci-fi pick  
•	The Count of Monte Cristo - Alexandre Dumas - friend's favorite  
•	The Thief - Megan Whalen Turner - mentioned on reddit  
•	The Silkworm - Robert Galbraith - sequel to a book I had read  
•	11-22-63 - Stephen King - I wanted to read a King book that wasn't too scary  
•	Phantom of the Opera - Gaston Leroux - friend's recommendation  
•	At Home in Mitford - Jan Karon -  recommendation  
•	The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg - recommendation  
•	The Time Machine - H.G. Wells - Husband's recommendation  
•	A Short History of Nearly Everything - Bill Bryson - I wanted a book that was educational  
•	A Brief History of Time - Steven Hawking - I just wanted to read it...  
•	Nausicca of the Valley of the Wind - Hayao Miyazaki - I wanted to add a graphic novel to the list, and it was pretty much the most recommended after Watchmen  

The Journey:  After taking some time to carefully form my list, I told reddit about my plan on 11-15-2014.  Everyone was excited for me and super supportive of my idea, and some gave me recommendations to help me succeed.  I was already excited to get started because carefully choosing these book had made me want to read them, but now I was even more excited, and that night I picked up The Time Machine.    

&nbsp;


**Book 1:  The Time Machine** - borrowed

•	Started on 11-15-14

•	Finished on 11-17-14

•	Thoughts:  I chose to read it first because it was little and intriguing.  I have to say, I thought I kind of knew the story from watching Wishbone in my younger years, but the book had many surprises for me.  I really enjoyed it!  It's very readable, but still felt like an adult book to me, if that makes sense.  The time traveler's story seemed to end a bit abruptly, but perhaps that was just because I didn't want it to end.  I think it was a good book to start with.  

•	Future plans:  I would really like to read The Invisible Man and The War of the Worlds which are also by H.G. Wells  

**Book 2(kind of): A Short History of Nearly Everything** - AUDIOBOOK free from Audible trial 
 
•	Downloaded on 11-17-14  

•	Finished:  4-12-15  

•	Thoughts:  I chose to ""read"" this one with the help of an audiobook based on reddit suggestions.  Several people said it was great in that format, and that I might be overwhelmed reading it normally.  I have a long commute so I decided to try it out.  It probably wouldn't be second on the list, but since I can listen to it when I go to work tomorrow, it got bumped up.  And...it took me several months to finish it.  I had to be in the mood for it.  I didn't have to pay close attention, but if I wasn't paying enough attention then I wouldn't have any idea what miraculous thing he was talking about.  I have a confession to make as well.  I didn't really read summaries of the books on my list because I wanted to be pleasantly surprised by them.  This backfired here because I kind of assumed this was a book about history in the more historical sense of the word and expected to learn about wars and empires and such.  Oh well.  On the whole, I really enjoyed the book, and felt like it was a good review of many things I learned in school (I was a biology major and took a lot of science courses).  It can be tedious at times, as different sections are on different topics so if a topic isn't something you're interested in then it goes by rather slowly.  However, he's great at making things seem accessible, and helps you see the extraordinary in the ordinary world around us.  

•	Future Plans:  Actually read a history book like I meant to....  

**Book 3: The Phantom of the Opera** - bought for $1 at used bookstore  

•	Started: 11-19-14  

•	Finished: 11-23-14  

•	Thoughts:  It took some getting used to, since it's an older book and the writing and language style is so different, but overall it was pretty engaging and enjoyable.  I had only seen the movie once before, and I re-watched it after I finished the book.  My conclusion is that the book is much better than the movie (though the movie has awesome music of course).  Gaston Leroux does a great job of making the story believable, and even leaves you questioning if perhaps it was a true story.  The story is based on a real opera house, and perhaps real rumors of a ghost, but from what brief internet research I did that appeared to be all.  The book is of course far-fetched, but in ways much less far-fetched than the movie, and far more intriguing in my opinion.  Glad I read it.  

•	Future Plans:  Perhaps some Sherlock Holmes?  I have heard good things about those stories, and the end of Phantom mentioned them, which made me think it wouldn't be bad for my next list.  

**Book 4 (at least it was supposed to be):  Snow Crash** - bought from Amazon.com  
 
•	I started this book sometime back in December, and today (2-24-15) I have decided to put it down for good.  I did not finish it.  I managed to get through about a third of it, and every bit was a struggle.  When I made my original post many people recommended that I move on if I couldn't get into a book.  I tried not to do that because I kept hoping I'd begin to enjoy this book, but I just couldn't.  I dreaded picking it up and trying to get through more of it.  After I decided to give up on it, I read the synopsis online.  It had interesting ideas to be sure, but the writing style and the world that the author created were just too out there for me I guess.  I will choose a new book for the list, but I will determine which one at a later time.  

**Actual Book 4: The Thief** - bought for $1 at a used bookstore  

Started:  2-24-15  

Finished: 3-4-15 
 
Thoughts:  Loved it!  It was an easy read, but didn't feel childish.  It kept me engaged and intrigued the whole way through, and was so nice to read after being previously discouraged by a book I wasn't enjoying.  I am going to send it to my brother-in-law in the navy who is currently out on deployment because I think he'll enjoy it just as I did.

Future Plans:  I am definitely interested in reading the three additional books in this little series.  I hope they're just as good!  

**Book 5:  A Town Like Alice (replaced Snow Crash)** - bought from Kindle store for $2.99  

Started: 3-6-15  

Finished 3-22-15  

Thoughts:  Very good book!  After reading The Thief and enjoying it so much, I searched reddit for it to see what was recommended by other people who liked it, one redditor said that this was their favorite book.  The first two chapters were a bit tedious and I didn't see where they were going, but as soon as the second chapter ended I couldn't wait to go on.  From that point on, I was intrigued by the characters journey.  It is a fiction book, but it's based on true events so you definitely feel very immersed because it is something that could actually happen.  I feel like it's a book that girls will enjoy more than guys, simply because there is a bit of a love story and because the heroine is a very strong and independent woman.

Future Plans:  So, apparently this author (Nevil Shute) has a dedicated following, and they call themselves ""Shutists.""  I must say that I did enjoy his writing, so I intend to try another of his books in the future.  The Shutists have voted Trustee From The Toolroom as the favorite according to their website, so I have my eye on that one.  

**Book 6:  11-22-63** - Audible.com  

Started: 4-12-15  

Finished: Sometime in June...I think  

Thoughts:  So...remember how I started my Audible free trial for A Short History of Nearly Everything?  Well, as the Audible people were hoping, I kind of procrastinated and didn't cancel my subscription for a few months.  Slightly sad for my wallet, but at least I have the credits to use for books!  That's why I decided to go ahead and get another audiobook.  That, and my tablet has been having issues and I was in the middle of painting a room in my house (which is how I finally finished A Short History) and listening to the books while painting was a really nice way to make the time go by.  11-22-63 really grabbed me pretty quickly.  I must admit that Mr. King is an excellent story teller, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I wasn't in love with the ending, but the very end sent a tear down my cheek.  I would definitely still recommend the book, and am glad that I read it.  
Future Plans: I would love to read something else by Stephen King, and I have actually already purchased The Stand with one of my audible credits.  It may be a while before I get to it, but I'm looking forward to it!  

**Book 7:  The Silkworm** - Borrowed digitally from the local library (who knew you could do that?!)  

I've gotten bad at keeping up with my notes... I read the Silkworm.  I enjoyed it more than the first book of this trilogy, and I am planning on reading the last book when it comes out.  They are good books, but not really exciting enough for me to heartily recommend.  Of course, I may be judging them on a tougher scale due to my love for the Harry Potter series. UPDATE: Apparently what I thought was going to be a three book series is actually going to be much longer...part of me wants to keep going, but I probably won't rush out and buy them right when they come out.  

**Book 8:  The Count of Monte Cristo** - Audiobook from audible.com
  
Started:  I believe in July  

Finished:  I still haven't finished...  

I still have not finished listening to this book.  I know that's sad.  I'm going to finish it, just not very fast apparently.  So far, I have to say, it's an amazing story.  I can see why it's a classic, and why so many people love it.  The nice thing about listening to it, is that I never would have pronounced any of the names correctly on my own.  However, I think I would have finished it on time (maybe..) if I had the physical book.  I have a physical copy, but it is abridged.  Looking back on this though, perhaps the abridged edition would have been just fine.  

**Book 9:  At Home in Mitford** - Used bookstore for $1  

Started:  Around the end of July  

Finished:  8-22-2015  

Thoughts:  Considering that this book was recommended to me by a very sweet, 70-something year old lady, it was just what I expected; a pretty easy, and relaxing read.  The author does a good job giving you just enough details, while letting you fill in the rest, and you really do feel like this is a real town with real people.  It's a nice book, and I think can especially be appreciated if you go to church and enjoy Bible references.  I am planning to give this book to my friend now that I'm done because she's been stressed and could use a sweet little read like this.  

Future Plans:  I do not currently plan to read the rest of the series.  I enjoyed this book, and will even recommend it to people, but I currently don't casually read enough to read this series.  When I do read, I need a really intriguing story or I probably won't finish the book.  That being said, I may later find that this sweet little series is just what I need to escape from stress, so who knows?  

**Book 10: The Land of Painted Caves (replaced A Brief History of Time)** - Used bookstore for $6.50  

Finished: 10-11-15 
 
Thoughts:  This is the last book of a series that I have always loved.  Personally, I think it feels like the author really rushes the story in parts, and I didn't enjoy it as much as the earlier books in the series.  I also thought it could have ended in a better place.  No matter, I'm glad I finished the series, and I will always appreciate it.  

**Book 11:  The Great Gatsby (replaced Nausicca)** - Already owned it  

Finished on 10-31-15  

Thoughts:  For the most part, I enjoyed the book.  Fitzgerald's imagery was great, I thought, and really made you feel like you understood how the characters were feeling and what they were going through.  Of course, I also thought that most of the characters were out of their minds so it's tough to understand why they do and say what they do.  Anyway, I'm glad I read it since it's a classic and several people I know like it, but I wasn't wowed by it.  

**Book 12: The Martian** - bought at Walmart  

Finished on 11-15-15 (Just in time!)  

Thoughts:  I would recommend this book to anyone (except perhaps sweet old ladies who would potentially be offended by language).  The book is engaging, funny, exciting, and just all around awesome.  I'm pretty sure I cried twice while reading it...Anyway, just read it, especially if you haven't seen the movie yet because the book is pretty much always better.  My husband is now reading the book so we can't see the movie until he finishes it.  
Future plans:  I guess this book is ""real science sci-fi.""  I really enjoyed it and may look for other things in that category.

&nbsp;


**Negative points** for not yet finishing The Count of Monte Cristo...in my defense, this audio book is 52 hours long, and 11-22-63 and A Short History of Nearly Everything were also humongous books.    

**Bonus Points:**  I had previously read most of The Hobbit and hadn't finished the last chapter or so, and I did finish it before going to see the final movie.  

**What now?**  Well, I'm going to keep reading.  Here are some things I'd like to read based on what I have read this year.
Invisible Man and The War of the Worlds, a history book, sequels to The Thief, Trustee From The Toolroom, The Stand (already on my audible account), The Three Musketeers (on audible already), maybe Cormoran Strike novels, another real science sci-fi.  

**Overall thoughts:**  Technically I failed since I didn't finish The Counte of Monte Cristo, but I feel like this was an amazing success.  This was a great experiment for me, and I am hoping the effects will last.  I have been a picky reader in the past, and I struggled to find books I liked and to finish books that I started.  The last book I read, The Martian, was one that someone told me was good, but that I didn't necessarily intend to read.  Well, then I was at Walmart, saw it, thought it looked good, and bought it.  Just like that!  That's a big deal for me.  I'm not afraid to give books a try like I was before this started.  I also learned a lot about where to get books as well as different formats that are available.  I would recommend the 12 books in 12 months program to anyone who wants to get into reading more (or just to get out of your reading comfort zone).  Thank you for the support Reddit, and of course, all book recommendations are welcome!

rl1opg,Is it just me or is Shannon Mayer just bad?,"My kindle kept recommending Shannon Mayer and her Nix series to me, it has high ratings, is about a John Wick type story and protagonist, also some magic. Sounds cool, I bought it.

Its horrible, or am I missing something? The main character just gets thrown at us and we are told how badass she is instead of showed. Mayer keeps repeating herself again and again, showing what we should think, what the character thinks into our noses. Its not even on the nose, its up the nose so deep its halfway to my lungs by the end of the first chapter. She is paranoid, we get it. She has mysterious deadly past, we get it! She does not have to repeat it again and again, just show it!

Then her husband and child dies, I suppose that should be the spark that starts the revenge story or whatever. But they both had zero character! We get told how much she loves them, we get told how amazing they are, but we aint shown anything. I felt nothing for any of the three characters in the car crash ambush, whatever that was. Then we move on to the hospital... how many times do we get told ""it was no accident"" what happened? 6 times? 7? We get it! The main character is sure it was an assassination attempt at her and her family, that she survived, somehow. Move on with the god damn story, stop repeating yourself again and again!

Will it get better? Or did I just throw away a few dollars at absolutely horrible books?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rl1opg/is_it_just_me_or_is_shannon_mayer_just_bad/,2021-12-21T00:39:39Z,2,9,books,It Ends with Us,POST
11w45n,Red Mars by  Kim Stanley Robinson - Does it get any better?,"I have read about one tenth of the first book and so far I absolutely hate it. (Please try to avoid spoilers.)

It starts with apparently one of main characters getting another one murdered in extremely cliche and annoying way. Then it seems to go to beginning of trip to tell story how it came to that. I really hate it when author gives us huge spoiler at start of the book.

My big problem is that it seems to be not science fiction at all. So far it has been just social dynamics. It seems Mars is total afterthought and book could just as well about life in small town where two people compete being mayor and end up murdering each other.

Does it get any better? Or is whole series mostly about power struggle for leadership?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11w45n/red_mars_by_kim_stanley_robinson_does_it_get_any/,2012-10-22T12:06:15Z,21,47,books,It Ends with Us,POST
lp1kvp,"So, I finished The Sound and the Fury yesterday. It was my first time reading Faulkner, and I felt that it was both under- and over-whelming. [Long Post - Possible Spoilers]","I've wanted to make my way through the classics for a while. While looking for something new to start with I cam across Faulkner. Unlike with Hemingway and Fitzgerald, I didn't know anything about Faulkner. I had heard his name in passing, but I wasn't familiar with his works. I was a little nervous to get into his writing when looking up reviews on his books, because most people were in agreement that his writing was confusing and difficult. I actually didn't know what to expect, but the stream-of-consciousness narrative appealed to me as did the positive comments that lauded the beauty of his writing. I had also seen the words >!incest, castration, suicide!< in a couple of reviews, so along with the brief summary of the book I had a vague idea of what I was getting into.

The story was definitely disjointed and difficult to follow. I had a base understanding of what was happening, but it was confusing to know what was actually happening in the story. I found Quentin's part of the book to be the most difficult with this. There was a period of time where he >!got into a car with some people after being released from jail and then suddenly he had gotten into a fight with one after standing up mid-conversation and asking something like ""Did you ever have a sister?!"" It was just sort of confusing because I was lost after realizing that I didn't understand when we had changed from him having memories of Caddy to being in a fight.!< I think Faulkner didn't always do the best job with these transitions, but I definitely see the beauty in the stream-of-consciousness there; that's how our lives unfold day by day as we are carried by the thoughts in our head and what's going on outside of ourselves. It's untidy, and especially so with a neurotic/existentialist character like Quentin, but it's no less beautiful. 

I also want to point out that my version of the book did come with the appendix about all of the characters. However, I didn't realize this until the end of the book because I was reading the ebook version. After reading that section things made more sense. It's definitely a book that you have to read at least twice to fully catch the spirit of the book once everything is laid out. I'm not sure how most people with the appendix read this book. I powered through it to the end not knowing much of what I was getting into. My advice for those going into it freshly would be to read the appendix first. While it may reveal some elements of the story, I think it allows for one to actually focus on and enjoy the imagery of the story (plus, there isn't really much story to reveal or spoil). 

Anyway, the under-whelming feeling came from getting to the end and feeling that a big unfolding plot and climatic resolution had never came. All in all, the book was about the demise of a southern family descended from antebellum southern aristocrats. Everything else was just about their day to day experiences which parallels the snippet from Macbeth where The Sound and the Fury derives its name. I kind of already knew this going into it, but it became more apparent what people actually meant once I reached the end. So, story wise I would probably place The Sound and the Fury on par with The Great Gatsby, which I found to be especially lackluster.

Now, that said, I overall wouldn't put The Sound and the Fury on the level of the Great Gatsby due to its stream-of-consciousness style narrative. I find that to be its redeeming quality, which is why I found the book to be overwhelming. Even today, the poetic beauty of this book still sticks with me. I hungered for a big resolution that made the book worth reading, yet the poetic prose of stream of consciousness was so beautiful that the emotions of it all made my heart ache. The beauty of Faulkner is in his writing style. It’s that he has poetic prose that makes you cling to the experiences of the characters. When he says something like “drowning in honeysuckles” you can damn well smell it in your soul. It just *is*, and you feel it. >!Quentin waiting until the end of the academic year because the money for school had been at the expense of one of the things Benjy loved most. Basically he felt that going before that would have made the loss for nothing. And that just hurts. Of the three things Benjy loved most he lost 2, yet didn’t lose anything because he couldn’t grasp the concept of losing, only the feeling left of loss.!< Idk man. It just says so much even if seems so little

Reading Faulkner definitely enriched my vocabulary, and I highlighted a handful of words in my Kindle. I stopped reading during and several years after college, so my grammar/spelling/vocabulary have diminished (we are too reliant on autocorrect these days lol). I can usually understand the gist of a word, but I like looking them up and collecting them to truly understand their exact meanings. Here were some I collected from The Sound and the Fury: 

1. Spherules
2. Gelded
3. Dipsomaniac
4. Connubial
5. Temerity
6. Uxorious
7. Dropsical
8. Patina
9. Moribund
10. Hame
11. Pinioned
12. Philoprogenitive
13. Progenitive
14. Fecundity
15. Peripatetic
16. Fo'c's'le
17. Lowing (I've actually come across this in film recently as well. Cows lowing. I didn't realize this existed because I've only ever read mooing. 

And, finally, here are some of my favorite parts that I highlighted:

1. I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it. Because no battle is ever won he said. They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.  
2. They said you couldn't have told they'd ever seen one another before, like a King and Queen, not even looking at one another, just moving side by side across Massachusetts on parallel courses like a couple of planets. 
3. And we'd sit in the dry leaves that whispered a little with the slow respiration of our waiting and with the slow breathing of the earth and the windless October, the rank smell of the lantern fouling the brittle air, listening to the dogs and to the echo of Louis' voice dying away. He never raised it, yet on a still night we have heard it from our front porch. When he called the dogs in he sounded just like the horn he carried slung on his shoulder and never used, but clearer, mellower, as though his voice were a part of darkness and silence, coiling out of it, coiling into it again.
4. The sound of the bees diminished, sustained yet, as though instead of sinking into silence, silence merely increased between us, as water rises.
5. We crossed the river. The bridge, that is, arching slow and high into space, between silence and nothingness where lights-- yellow and red and green--trembled in the clear air, repeating themselves. (I'm pretty sure this is the most beautiful way that I have ever read a description of traffic lights)
6. >!Committed suicide in Cambridge Massachusetts, June 1910, two months after his sister's wedding, waiting first to complete the current academic year and so get the full value of his paid-in-advance tuition, not because he had his old Culloden and Carolina and Kentucky grandfathers in him but because the remaining piece of the old Compson mile which had been sold to pay for his sister's wedding and his year at Harvard had been the one thing, excepting that same sister and the sight of an open fire, which his youngest brother, born an idiot, had loved. !<",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lp1kvp/so_i_finished_the_sound_and_the_fury_yesterday_it/,2021-02-21T17:12:36Z,12,18,books,It Ends with Us,POST
4v4tae,"Just read ""Off Season"" by Jack Ketchum and it is perhaps the most terrifying and disgusting horror book I've ever read, but also the best I've ever read. Let's discuss it.","Be warned: some spoilers and graphic description ahead. 

I was first introduced to Ketchum through a random horror novel my mom gave me for Christmas a few years back entitled ""The Lost"". For Ketchum fans who've read this book you may have differing opinions on it, but for me it was simply spectacular. A page turner from the get go with such real emotion, characters and situations that it began to feel real. It was a totally new reading experience. For the next few years I would always bring up ""The Lost"" in conversations about favorite horror novels or favorite novels in general but it was not until this year that I finally took the dive into Ketchum's other works. This decision was in large part due to my love for ""The Lost"" and also due to Stephen King's outspoken appreciation of Ketchum.

I chose to start with his breakout piece, ""Off Season"".  I ordered the completely uncensored and unedited 2006 print with all parts originally deemed too violent left in tact. After three days I completed the novel but not solely because it was an amazing read (although it was) but because of the utter sense of doom, dread and fear it instilled in me. How could I ever sleep without knowing the ending?  To give a bit of context about myself, I often read horror novels from Stephen King and Dean Koontz. Yes, their novels often are creepy and I love them all, but never have their books ever truly terrified me (at least not until adapted into a film). This is where Jack Ketchum and ""Off Season""  separate from the bunch. A bit of plot context: 

""Off Season"" is the tale of a woman who is renting a house for a summer to work on her writing. Naturally she has some friends and family visit only to have a family of inbred cannibals who live in a cave descend upon them, capture them, and ultimately torture them to death.

For fans of horror films this all seems rather basic at face value but somehow it becomes far more intense and complicated as the story gets more and more simple. Reading the last 100 pages was the most terrifying and heart pounding moments I've ever experienced while reading. After I struggled to sleep and today, all day, images of the final tortures have invaded my thoughts and flashed through my brain. I can't stop thinking about it. This is where Ketchum really excels. He induces not fear but actual terror in its most primitive form in a reader who is only imagining what is happening, not even seeing it. As he describes a woman being dismembered systematically, her tongue being ripped from her mouth, the sounds of her arms as they are cut from her body all while being kept alive so she may experience it first hand, I could feel my heart sink and the novel ceased to become merely book any longer. It became a reality. I could smell it, taste it and see it and it was awful. 

And yet, somehow, this all made the book amazingly wonderful! How? How can something so vile and so horrible be great? Simple. It actually put me in the story. I felt it all, I experienced it! I didn't read it, I lived it! Never, let me repeat, NEVER have I ever been so engrossed, involved and terrified of a book before and because of that it has become the best horror novel and perhaps the best novel I've ever read. 

If you have an interest in reading this book then be warned: this is not a book for the faint of heart. It is a whirlwind of gore, rape and torture and the inescapable hand of death. It doesn't tell us, but illustrated to us that nobody is safe, we are all just tiny ants who are lucky to be alive every day. I was horrified and gladly surprised by this novel and even almsot vomited twice! So do I recommend this novel? It's hard to say. On the one hand I want to say ""do it! It's the most amazing horror book ever!"" But on the other hand I want to scream ""no! Turn around! Walk away! Do not read this! It will fuck you up!""

I'm the end only you can decide and perhaps some fellow readers here may be able to add to this conversation and discuss some more their likes and dislikes of the book as well as their own personal opinions and experiences!

2v5cjl,"Some background on Fifty Shades, proof of excessive borrowing, and why I implore you to discourage others from paying to see it this weekend","All the people and websites asking you to use the money you would have paid to see *Fifty Shades* and donate it to domestic violence and abuse charities aren't wrong. You can find a lot of resources out there explaining why. I think we all know by this point that it's to some degree a depiction of emotional abuse, aside from also being, you know, just objectively bad writing. 

But in seeing the media surrounding this, I've been disappointed that the narrative is lacking in facts about EL James' bad ethics as a peer, an author, and a fan of an existing franchise. 

So in the spirit of being the change I want to see in the world, here are some things that I hope you might consider before giving these people your money. I'm doing this on a throwaway. I don't care about karma. But I'd sincerely appreciate an upvote toward getting this seen.

**1. Fanfiction**

In 2009, EL James came into the *Twilight* fanfic community posturing herself as [a friend and a fellow fan](http://imgur.com/LV4EQwA). The fanfiction community she entered was a thriving, creative crowd of varying men and women who were sharing something they were passionate about: writing. 

To really understand the whole nature of James' deceit, you'd need to understand that *Twilght* fanfiction was really not about *Twilight* much. It was not a very good series. A lot of us entered as fans and, upon having to dive into the canon daily, just grew; as writers, as individuals, as critics. We grew out of it. However, there was still a major value in this enormous group of people using this same template to continue growing and collaborating. The fanfics were easy reads for people who just wanted a generic romance novel for free. We already knew the characters, we already had investments. It was a fun playground. Take what you wanted from *Twilight* and discard the rest. 

Most often, this only included a very vague impression of Edward and Bella and the actors who'd play them, a skeleton of the relationships, locations, and story structure.

There were rarely any vampires at all. [""All-Human"" stories absolutely dominate the community.](http://imgur.com/qBIGrAH)

But deep within the foundations of every All-Human story, *Twilight* was present. Hell, it was a *challenge*. ""Try to find a creative way to make this scene connect to the source canon."" 

You can see it in *Fifty Shades of Grey* (Master of the Universe) [if you look](http://jamigold.com/2012/03/when-does-fan-fiction-cross-an-ethical-line/#comment-16009).

>* both Edward and Christian were adopted.
* both Edward and Christian have a deep, dark, dangerous secret that no one is privy to, except for the heroine and by extension us
* both Edward and Christian are rich and more sophisticated than the heroine
* both Christian and Edward have stalker tendencies and are domineering
* Both Edward and Christian have reddish/bronze tinted hair
* Both Edward and Christian give the heroine a car
* Both Edward and Christian are piano-players
* Both Edward and Christian have a loving supportive adoptive family comprised of
  - Carrick/Carlisle (the father)
  - Grace/Esme (the mother)
  - Elliot/Emmet (the brother)
  - Mia/Alice (the sister). The remaining two members of the ensemble, Jasper and Rosalie discussed below.
* Jasper and Rosalie/Ethan and Kate in FSoG. Rosalie and Kate are both blonde, beautiful and a high contrast to Bella. Kate and Elliot end up together as a couple which is reminiscent of them also being a couple in Twilight (Rose and Emmet).
* Jasper and Alice are a couple in Twilight, Ethan from FSoG ends up setting his sights on the proto-Alice character in FSoG, Mia. BOOM!, there you go, your whole Twilight Cullen cast/ensemble, reloaded.
* Both Twilight and FSoG have the couple following the arc of initial attraction, hero attempting to separate himself from heroine by stating he’s not right for her, heroine pursuing relationship, heroine finding out dark secret, heroine still pursuing relationship, couple briefly parts/breaks up and then reunites, couple marries, goes off to exotic/romantic honeymoon, heroine gets preggers prematurely, hero reacts extremely negatively, heroine still has kid. Hero eventually comes around about kid.
* Both stories are set in Washington state.
* Jacob/José (Twilight/FSoG) both dislike the hero because they want to be with the heroine. The heroine is not interested in Jacob/José but Jacob/José continues to pursue her until he gives up and realizes that the heroine chose the “bad guy” over them.
* Anastasia... acts like Bella, she says the same things Bella would. She is highly clumsy and uncoordinated, she is quiet, reserved, not popular, odd one out, like Bella. She bites her bottom lip like Bella. She feels a bit like a fish out of water in the presence of the Greys just like Bella feels in the presence of the Cullens. At most she is a proto-Bella but essentially the same character at the core.
* Both Bella and Ana have a bit of an excentric mother that lives somewhere else and has remarried several times (at least twice from what I remember).
* Both Bella and Ana have a father that they love, that lives by himself (is a bit of a loner), that has a great relationship with them, even if slightly distanced. The main difference is that Ray (FSoG) is a stepfather to Ana, while Charlie (Twilight) is blood father to Bella.
* Both Charlie and Ray have a love of fishing.
* Both stories feature a stalker (Lauren/Leila) who stalks Bella/Ana and wants to hurt/kill her.
* Jasper and Rose pretend to be twins in Twilight. Ethan and Kate (their parallels) are twins in FSoG.
* Esme & Carlisle/Grace & Carrick never thought their adopted son would find happiness and was destined to be alone. When Bella/Ana comes along it becomes ‘possible’ for their son to finally find happiness.
* Mia/Alice are obsessed with clothes. Edward/Christian are really close to his adopted sister.
* The Cullens & the Grays have loads of money and Bella/Ana is intimidated by this.
* The Cullens brought clothes all the time for Bella. Ana also receives designer clothes. 

And this is honestly just the tip of the iceberg. [Even in the movie's marketing they're using Bella's mannerisms](http://imgur.com/FGI9i02).

http://imgur.com/c8UBJ5Y

Of course, no one's going to copyright 'lip biting' or posit plagiarism for any of the above. It's that these mannerisms, this characterization, this collection of little, seemingly mundane details... they existed to appeal to *Twilight* fans, *specifically*. They existed in *Fifty Shades* because they existed in *Twilight*. 

And yet Vintage, James' publisher, would go on to defend this series as original:

>Vintage issued a statement to the AP Saturday defending 50 SHADES as an original work, and said to us that James had warranted the books were, indeed original. Messitte added she was “aware of the narrative that [50 SHADES] started as differently titled piece of fiction, but that they were and are two distinctly separate pieces of work.” A request for comment from Meyer’s agent, Jodi Reamer at Writers House, was not responded to at press time.

>Vintage defended “50 Shades” as an original creation with a passionate following.

>“It is widely known that E.L James began to capture a following as a writer shortly after she posted her second fan fiction story,” Vintage said in a statement. “She subsequently took that story and **re-wrote the work, with new characters and situations**. That was the beginning of the ‘Fifty Shades’ trilogy. The great majority of readers, including fan fiction aficionados, have found ‘Fifty Shades’ deeply immersive and incredibly satisfying.”

Despite claims that she ""re-wrote the work"", it was revealed to be [89% similar](http://dearauthor.com/features/industry-news/master-of-the-universe-versus-fifty-shades-by-e-l-james-comparison/) by plagiary software. Basically, the only thing that changed were the character names and some minor (too minor, tbh) copyediting. There is nothing in *Fifty Shades* that wasn't already in *Master of the Universe*.

**2. Creative Collaboration**

No one's going to cry any rivers for Stephenie Meyers, the author of *Twilight*, for having parts of her work and a huge chunk of her fandom pseudo-stolen. But how about *Twilight* fanfiction authors such as TaraSueMe, who wrote [*The Submissive*](http://www.usatoday.com/story/happyeverafter/2013/03/13/tara-sue-me-interview-the-submissive/1983243/), a fanfic about a domineering Edward with a dark past who seduces an innocent Bella into the practice of BDSM, before James wrote her own fanfic? 

>The trilogy has been around since January 2009. It was originally Twilight fanfic and was one of the fics E.L. James read before writing the fanfic that would become Fifty Shades.

It's really no secret in the community that *Fifty Shades* was 'inspired by' *The Submissive* and *The Office* (another Twilight fanfic) when they grew to ridiculous levels of popularity. Even past that, you can find dozens upon dozens of influences in *Fifty Shades* that harken back to other popular fanon (trends, not rooted in canon, that were created by the collective). 

Even Bella's ""Inner Goddess"" is pretty obviously 'inspired by' Edward's ""Inner Monster"" in *Twilight* fanfic darling, *Midnight Desire*, an erotic parody of *Midnight Sun*. 

The 'inspiration' is clear:

http://imgur.com/a/DrGVb

There isn't anything in *Fifty Shades* that can't be traced back to either *Twilight* or some other fanfic.

If the foundation of *Fifty Shades* was mostly Twilight, and the plot and sexual fantasy elements were mostly *The Submissive* and *The Office*, and the more minor details were either collectively created fanon or blatantly taken from other fanfics, then it makes you wonder...

http://imgur.com/u89j7qe

It's a miracle she even took the time to type it all out. The only unique identifier she managed to put on this story is its *badness*. All of the fics borrowed from are undoubtedly of higher quality.

Mind you, this woman is currently worth $95 million as a result of this. 

**3. Grand Theft Fandom**

It took a long time for me to come to terms with why I was so angry at James for never being a fan. None of us were really fans of *Twilight*, in the end, so who cares? 

The difference is that, despite being 'inspired by' other popular fanfics and trends, James was never really a part of the community. She set herself apart. Once *Master of the Universe* gained popularity, there was no *Twilight* fandom. To her, the fandom was split into two distinct sections:

- *""Master of the Universe""* fandom
- Those other people over there, doing other stuff that I don't care about 

[Take it from James herself:](http://fiftyshadesofpopculturetheory.blogspot.com/p/dragon-and-angst.html)

>*AG: ...negativity exists everywhere. even when you publish it on amazon, theres still gonna be negativity*

>ELJ: true... but I’m sure it’s easier to take with a big fat paycheck LOL.

>*AG: and negativity has its place. it’s what stops us all from monopolizing on ideas that arent totally ours*

>ELJ: Look I am not saying I will publish it...or pull it or anything. I have to say I do not feel as passionately as you do about the fandom...

>*AG: that saddens me. i think fandom has been a really great place for you. a lot of your supporters are here*

>ELJ: My readers have been a great place for me... I have some wonderful, wonderful readers and they are fabulous. and I am beyond honoured

>*AG: but your readers are the fandom*

>ELJ: but I see them like that...part of the fandom. it’s like the old groucho marx joke which I cant remember about not wanting to belong to a club that you’re a member of...

>*AG: ...you just have to get in there. read what people are saying and reacting. make yourself more reltable. show them theres a person behind the penname and not just some lady sitting on a perch*

>ELJ: I like my perch...

This sums up James' participation in the fandom pretty nicely. She needed material to 'inspire' her, and she needed the fans to read her shit and make it popular. After she'd gotten that, she wanted no part of it. She was ready to cash in. 

>ELJ: I have done it as a sort of exercise... to see if I could... and I think I have proven that I can... I now want to capitalize on it...

**4. Salt and Burn**

Today, the *Twilight* fanfic community is basically tumbleweeds. What was once a thriving creative environment has become little more than novel test-runs from ouside authors, and a climate so rife with paranoia that stories get pulled after only just barely seeing the light of day. There have been numerous [plaigiarism cases](http://dearauthor.com/book-reviews/monday-news-shey-stahl-plagiarism-scandal-goodreads-deletes-reviews-without-notice-amazon-shares-at-an-all-time-high-cosplay-copyright-and-paid-for-reviews/) by authors who see the profit potential of *Twilight* fanfiction, but can't be bothered to write their own. By posting your content on fanfiction.net, you agree to a TOS that states your work cannot be copyrighted. Because of this fear, authors feel forced to publish their fanfictions to gain a more solid defense in the event of plagiary.  

You also see romance authors who come into the fandom for the sole purpose of courting *Twilight* fans and gaining some pre-release hype. All they need to do is change the names to Edward and Bella, post the novel, get a bunch of praise, appeal to peoples' senses of sentimentality by making them feel like they're 'friends' who are all in this fiction thing together, and then publish that sucker on Amazon for $9.99. There's never been an easier way for a self-published author to get guaranteed sales. 

On top of all that, publishers trawl the community for books to contract. I'm not talking good publishers. I'm talking the shady operations who seduce a popular author with promises, do minimal editing on their fanfictions, slap a shitty cover on it, put it online for ten bucks and advertise it back to the fandom from whence it came. They then pocket most of the profits. 

This is the community post-EL James; a throbbing, uncomfortable business opportunity. And it isn't just *Twilight*. Other fanfic communities are feeling a similar climate these days.

950g7o,(SPOILERS) Some thoughts on Stephen King's IT,"I recently finished reading Stephen King's IT, and I have very mixed feelings about the novel. I should say there are heavy spoilers ahead and this is all my opinion.

There are definitely things I enjoyed about the novel. The characters are fun and interesting, and the way they interact (as friends, less so when IT is involved) feels genuine and realistic. It would be unfair to say they were only friends because they happened to be the ‘losers’. They were each interesting in their own way and complemented each other well. In King’s own words; they were greater than the sum of their parts. 

No matter how great the sum of their parts was however, they were still the losers. King uses topics that are engaging and help set the scene, the best example of this being bullying. Bullying is a tangible fear for 11 and 12-year olds, and so it is relatable, or at least recognizable, for the reader. Another example is the racism and homophobia; the controversy helps build a picture of the world of Derry and is a handy tool for character development.

This brings me to the next point; King has spent a lot of time fleshing out Derry, and I’m sure if you’ve read the book you have had a pretty clear view in your mind of what it would look like. While I think it’s good King wanted us to have a clear picture of Derry, I think maybe he was a bit too descriptive, but I’ll touch on that later.

The last thing I really enjoyed was the hopping between 1958 and 1985, seeing how the characters had grown up.

There was a lot in this book, however, that I found rather annoying. I thought the book was way too drawn out and long. The Derry interludes for example, added little to the story and were really just boring. You get characters you don’t really care about, set in a time you don’t really care about, and actually you just want to get through this as soon as possible to get back to the story, almost like a commercial break. There were other times were there would be pages and pages of description that I felt were not necessary.

I could’ve dealt with this had there not been other things that felt a bit off. I didn’t like the characters motives; they felt so unrealistic. I get that IT has ‘psychic’ powers and can influence what the characters think, but to me that’s just a cheap shortcut to giving the characters motives. There were too many encounters like this: “Why should we do that?” “We just should. I know it.”, and then all of them would blindly follow their leader Bill. Bill being seen as the unanimous leader was also a bit of a cliché.

The worst scene of the whole book was by far the scene where a 12-year-old Beverly decides she needs to have sex with all the boys. The reason I didn’t like this has nothing to do with it being inappropriate or anything, it’s just not realistic. It wasn’t even a thought being put in her mind by IT, it was her own decision. If there’s one thing I hate in books, it’s when characters do things that just wouldn’t happen in real life. Even worse than this (!), is that it actually works. Suddenly after the sex, they know what to do next. This scene is everything what was wrong with the book.

Another detail was that King spent so much time fleshing out Derry, only for the final encounter to end up in the sewers; a place where we can’t really imagine anything other than a dark tunnel. Of course we knew this encounter would be in the sewers from the start, but the encounter is less engaging because you can’t really visualize anything. 

After the sewers encounter(s), I didn’t like that the characters simply forgot everything, especially in the end of the book when IT was dead. All this character building, and it ends with ‘they all go home and forgot everything happened’. A lazy ending after King realized he spent too many pages describing things like coffee tables, if you ask me.

I’m not really what to think of the IT and Turtle thing, it was interesting I guess, but a bit too vague for my liking. I guess this was the clarification for IT’s psychic powers.

All in all, I enjoyed the story, but there were just loads of things that detracted from my enjoyment of it. I was surprised with this, because it’s rated so highly. What do you guys think about the book?

xvpnje,The Goldfinch won a Pulitzer and it sucks,"I don’t often put my thesis statement in the title but I don’t want to leave any confusion here. This book is terrible.

I went in knowing literally nothing about the book, which is honestly how I go into a lot of books. I’m not one of those weak souls who’s [terrified of spoilers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSRWJMM98pM) or anything like that, but I usually don’t need to know anything about a novel to give it a chance. The fact that it’s an award-winning novel is often enough for me to at least pick it up from the library.

That’s how I got here. And in service of keeping you from making my same mistake, I’m here to tell you that this book is definitely not worth your time. More than that, it’s not even worth your library card’s time.

## or, Intrigue!

The novel begins engaging enough, though I’ll tell you now: I hate books about New York for two reasons:

1. New York sucks
2. Because I’m an idiot who reads a lot of books, I have been reading about New York since my brain was the consistency of pancake batter and I have already memorized every street name and every story about young sensitive people with too much money and not enough sense.

Honestly, if you’re going to write a novel set in New York or if you’ve already written it or if you’re writing it now, change the setting. Even keep all the details identical but just say it’s taking place in Indianapolis. Don’t even edit out the many inevitable references to Brooklyn or subways rides. Just say that all of this is happening in Indianapolis and when anyone asks why Indianapolis sounds exactly like New York, just say it’s science fiction and stare at them without blinking until they’re like, “Uh, yeah, I get it.”

But because I didn’t bother learning even a single thing about the novel before starting, I didn’t hold this against it. Instead I just powered through, which is pretty easy because Tartt is a fantastic writer of a certain type of scene. The language and voice carry you along, lulling you into a sort of stupor so you don’t even care that part of you is wondering if this is just Catcher in the Rye for the 21st Century.

And then the bombs go off.

I really cannot describe how shocking this was to me. It felt like a rather mundane literary novel got invaded by a thriller and when you asked what the hell just happened the novel was just like, “Get on board, fella: we’re barreling to hell!”

When you’re on a rollercoaster, you may as well throw your hands in the air when it plummets back down to earth.

The chaos of the moment causes our young narrator, Theo, to steal The Goldfinch, a very famous and very expensive painting and take it home after being unable to find his mother.

The next hundred or so page deal with the fallout of this event. Theo is taken in by an excessively wealthy family. His former best friend is the son of this family. We get a lot of great interactions and relationships built. The effortless power of this section allows her to flex the novel quite a bit. And even though I think it mostly leads to disaster, it kept me reading because of how well the foundation of the novel is laid.

I really have to say: the first quarter or so of this book is just fantastic. It’s the perfect omelette.

It’s also a Victorian novel.

## or, the Ruined cathedral

A growing disquiet brewing inside me for months has made the following question ring in my head like a gong at midnight:

*What if I’ve already read all the good books?*

The question is both ridiculous and potentially more accurate than I’m comfortable with. I mean, obviously there are more books out there I’ll like a whole lot. The amount of books published through history may as well be infinite, but I do think I’m already familiar with the majority of writers I will truly love in life.

I read a lot of books. Thousands of them.

If this sounds like me bragging, ask yourself if you have ever been impressed by the number of books someone’s read.

Over the last few years, I’ve had varying degrees of success with reading fiction. Often, I find many books disappointing. Even ones that win awards or all kinds of acclaim. I’ve read pretty widely across genres as well, though it’s possible Romance, that great untapped fount, holds a great deal of promise.

I’ve been dipping my toes back into the 19th Century because many old favorites live there and so it was that I ended up reading Tess of the D’Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy, a novel perhaps most famous for the ways Hardy leverages culture and plot against his heroine.

Tess of D’Urbervilles is a moral novel. A brutal cultural critique. But this also makes it somewhat silly.

Many novels of the time period functioned this way. Sort of primers for behavior. Art meant to engineer society by giving people models of Right Action or at least by giving them models of Bad Behavior.

Much of this involves putting the protagonist through a lot of misery, excavating their heart and mind for the powerful emotions boiling beneath the reserved dignity of the age.

It’s a bit funny reading these old novels. Thomas Hardy is a great writer, pumping out luxurious prose and even creating masterful scenes of tension and desire. But he’ll race through years of summary so that he can capture an entire lifetime between his pages. And all that summary is largely to turn our complex characters into stock characters and/or metaphors for virtue or vice.

## or, the coney island sandcastle

The novel begins to go wrong once Theo’s estranged father returns. This section is also the last memorable part of the novel. For better or worse, it also holds the key to the action driving the rest of the narrative.

Where the opening section packed itself full of character interactions and intriguing scenarios and even moments of great emotional clarity or distress, this is where Tartt begins summarizing the novel.

I’m not against summary, by the way. But when you spend 30 pages writing a conversation between two drunk teenagers but summarize moments that change a relationship between characters, we have a problem.

For example: we get a lot of Boris in this section. Structurally, this makes sense because Boris is the hinge of the whole novel.

## A Brief Aside About Being a Teenage Dirtbag

As I have said before: I was an idiot. I have lived a stupid and sometimes dangerous life. My teenage years were a wash of depression, alcohol, insomnia, broken hearts and broken limbs, and a constant urge to die, to be dead, and the love shared between friends and almost lovers.

The relationship between Theo and Boris was made for me. Or, it should have been. I lived this stupid life, minus all the wealth. I was an idiot spending almost every night drunk with friends who I was so close to that the thought of being apart from them seemed worse than anything.

My friends were my family.

My relationship with my actual family has always been fraught. During high school, especially, I was very distant from my family. My family felt like six strangers forced to live together, but without all the fun and excitement of a season of The Real World. Instead it was more like six strangers trying to avoid one another in the same house.

And so I understand Theo and Boris. I was them.

The fact that this relationship did absolutely nothing for me in the book has got to be one of the biggest failings of the book. I was so predisposed to connect directly and fiercely to these characters living this deranged teenage life that Tartt didn’t even have to do much to make me feel this viscerally.

And yet!

All we get is summary for everything that matters, with so much of what matters in the novel skipped in service of…well, this is the whole problem.

## or, return to the coney island sandcastle

But Theo is living with his estranged father.

Their relationship is tense and awkward and very uncomfortable. But then, seemingly at random, Theo tells the reader that his relationship has improved dramatically with his father. He then summarizes a change in feeling that happened over the course of months.

It sure would have been great to see this! Instead, we had another scene drenched in shame between Theo and Boris where they seem poised to become lovers but never do.

Of course, the reason she summarizes this change in feeling is because it doesn’t actually matter, except to the degree that it moves the plot forward. Theo and his dad become closer just so that Theo’s dad can manipulate him into handing him a big chunk of his inherited wealth (this, of course, doesn’t go through), which leads directly to the death of his father, which sends him back to New York, Boris-less.

After the time jump, we’re back into the rhythm of his life in New York and Theo’s a drug addict but mostly just an asshole.

Slowly, I came to think Tartt had done something brilliant here: she pulled us in for 400 pages with a rather mundane literary novel only to then deliver us a thrilling art heist.

Yet once again, we don’t see Theo do any of this. We see Theo talk to Hobie for dozens of pages at a time, but we don’t see Theo do anything that’s actually driving the plot.

He’s sort of on the run as a conman and forger, amassing massive amounts of wealth by lying to rich idiots.

Do we see him pull off one of these cons? Do we see him getting deeper and deeper into this predicament?

No. We’re just told that it all happened later.

The novel becomes a you-had-to-be-there story strung together by dramatic scenes of tense dialogue between characters who were very well established and important to the first 150 pages of the novel.

Beneath it all is the fact that Theo still has The Goldfinch. At this point, he believes returning it would land him in prison so it’s his deepest, darkest secret. He’s hiding from the law because of his initial crime and now, too, because of all the fraud he’s perpetrating.

While Tartt’s powers as an author are enough to keep the tension rising, the stress circling like a noose around Theo, it all feels very abstract. And then Boris comes back into the novel and it does sort of become a thriller, albeit a ridiculously dumb one, and then we finish with Theo moralizing for dozens of pages to end the novel.

## or, spilled milk to the gallows

That the entire novel hinges on his theft of The Goldfinch is just stupid. When he steals the painting, it makes a sort of perfect sense. He’s in shock and not really able to think about what he’s doing. That he doesn’t immediately return it is believable enough because teenagers are notorious idiots.

But it also requires the suspension of a brain for hundreds of pages. At any point, Theo could have just thought about this for one minute and brought the painting back. Or, if he was so terrified of getting caught, he could have just left an anonymous tip and placed it where the authorities could find it.

Yes, I get it. It’s tied to the loss of his mother, but it’s also just dumb. Or, it would be less dumb if the novel remained a slice of life novel about the bored and boring and disinterested property class choking America. But instead it sort of gestures towards becoming a thriller and even walks those beats for a while.

But the biggest problem with the novel is that the emphasis is almost always pointed backwards.

Theo and Hobie talk for literally twenty pages about furniture or whatever, but we just skip everything that actually drives the novel. Whether it’s Theo’s relationship with his shitty dad or even the moment when Boris steals the painting from Theo (honestly, it really seems like this moment not being on the page is just bonkers levels of stupid) or any single moment where Theo perpetrates fraud on the unsuspecting overly wealthy clients of his and Hobie’s store, we never see any of it.

We never even see Theo’s relationship with Kitsey until they’re engaged. This is despite the fact that Kitsey is actually in a lot of the novel as a character bouncing along the periphery of the narrative.

## or, you can pour ketchup on your eggs, you freak

So what are we left with?

A thousand pages of idle chatter and the tension of consequences to actions we never witnessed.

It’s just bizarre. The structure of this story makes no sense. Tartt is a master when it comes to scene construction, but I have to ask: why did you choose so many scenes that have no consequence and leave out all the scenes that matter?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xvpnje/the_goldfinch_won_a_pulitzer_and_it_sucks/,2022-10-04T20:24:59Z,14,0,books,It Ends with Us,POST
66bjoc,Anybody who's interested in learning about what it was like on the Eastern Front during World War Two should read some former Soviet soldiers memoirs. It's astounding how many different types of hell these people's experienced.,"I posted this over in /r/history but didn't get that many responses. These books blow my mind because, with the exception of maybe some work by Vasily Grossman, there aren't many well known autobiographies of men and women on the Soviet side. While on the other hand, there's a bunch of well written ones from the German Wehrmacht. Those I've heard good things about, but I'm more interested in the Soviet side. Primarily because of how little English materials there are when it comes to First Hand Accounts. And secondly, because there is something deeply fascinating about the idea that these men and women, many of whom didn't even live in villages with running water or electricity, ended up fighting in the most destructive conflict of human history and ended up thousands of miles from their homes.

I mean I'm reading some of these stories and the shit these people went through blows my fucking mind. Whenever I think it can't get worse for them, it does. Right now I'm reading Red Road From Stalingrad by Mansur Abdulin, who was a front line infantryman at Kursk and Stalingrad, and within the first few pages he sets up a scene which, if there's ever a big budget movie adaptation of the Eastern Front, needs to be used. Lemme paint a picture: so Mansur, a 19 year old infantryman fresh out of school, is walking with his squad up to the front lines on a dark moonless night to relieve another group. They can barely see anything. As they're walking through this swamp he notices how wet, squishy, the ground is. His feet seem to get sucked into the muck. But most noticeable is the stench around them. It seems to fill and permeate everything and everyone. But, nobody seems to say anything about it so neither does he. Suddenly, a German flare goes off in the night sky and illuminates everything around them. To his horror, Mansur sees that they're walking through a swamp filled with the dead bodies of Soviet and Wehrmacht soldiers.

And that's just the beginning! Later on Mansur casually drops how many of the people in his village starved to death in the numerous famines that struck Russia under Stalin's rule. And how, at five years old, he saw his mother curse her friends who were ""lucky"" enough to have their kids die on them so they wouldn't be such a burden to an already miserable life. He says at five years old he understood his mother's suffering and didn't hold what she said against her. That's the kind of world these people grew up in. It really puts things into perspective and, oddly enough, gives me strength when it comes to getting through something that I find difficult but in reality is much, much, much, smaller then the shit they dealt with.

In addition, it's even more valuable for people like Americans to read, because we have never truly experienced what it's like to have our own country invaded. Imagine, today, that would Mexico invaded us with the plan to occupy the entire country kill off most of the population that it found genetically unworthy and then force the rest of us to work in the slave labor while Mexican settlers occupied their new territories. Imagine how that would change your entire country. Not that this justifies some of the things that Russia has done but it puts into perspective what it was like to fight there and explains why there was much more carnage and brutality between soldiers on that front as opposed to ones on the Western. 

These books give a window into what is was like to live back then, in villages that wouldn't have been out of place in the 1400's let alone the 1940's. Places that were so removed from modern technology that if you were to walk into one you'd have thought you'd stumbled through a wormhole. Yet these places would have the worst of both technology and humanity in 20th century knock on their front door, for better or for worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/66bjoc/anybody_whos_interested_in_learning_about_what_it/,2017-04-19T17:06:33Z,15,88,books,It Ends with Us,POST
4vlpb6,"Thoughts on Snow Crash (mostly spoiler-free, not that it really needs it)","Hey y'all, I just finished reading Snow Crash and I want to get out a few of my thoughts on it while they're still fresh in my mind. I've read through a few previous discussion threads and some of these points will be pretty similar, but I'm interested to hear what everyone thought of this book. I'll try to keep it fairly spoiler-free in case anyone looks to this as a recommendation thread.

To give some context, this was my first Neal Stephenson book. I've heard a lot of good things about his work from friends and sci-fi recommendations, and one thing that always interested me was how everybody mentioned how forward-thinking he was when it came to technology. I was excited to see what all the fuss was about. 

Overall, I enjoyed Snow Crash; that being said it's a lot to digest. I'll start with what I liked: Hiro is a great main character. He's not a deep, emotionally compelling character that I'd prefer in most stories, but rather he's the straightforward protagonist (which is literally his name) that's necessary to make a story with this many moving parts and complex ideas come together. It's hard not to find some childlike enjoyment in his cool and collected attitude. His chemistry with Y.T., while rushed, is fun as well. They serve as a counter to one another: Hiro is the noble, badass hacker/swordfighter that every teenager wants to be, while Y.T. is the realistic manifestation of that kid in the form of a smarmy, sarcastic jackass. In the context of the book, he represents the Metaverse and the digital realm, while she represents Reality.

The Metaverse is so vividly realized here that it's not hard to believe so many modern interpretations draw inspiration from it. I loved all the little geeky details and jokes Stephenson threw into the plot, especially in this virtual reality space. If nothing else, this book is a feast for someone interested in computing who will undoubtedly understand more of this niche humor than I could.

Now, what I disliked: 

I'd heard about the classic Stephenson ""info dump"", but I don't think there's really any way to prepare yourself for it. There are a few places where he'll veer off into discussing technology or big concepts, but most of them are nice touches to give the world more depth and often presently very humorously (one section that a particularly enjoyed was a 2-3 page description of government regulations concerning the proper use of office funds for purchasing toilet paper – a nice aside to satirize government bureaucracy). 

The one place that almost lost me in this book was Hiro's lengthy discussion with the Librarian about Sumerian history. Stephenson devotes a number of chapters to a very monotonous back-and-forth exchange between these two characters, perfectly willing to leave the reader in the dust with more questions than answers as we trust Hiro to figure out the puzzle for us. So many stories and historical texts followed quickly by excerpts from academics flash before our eyes that it's nearly impossible for the reader to follow Hiro's line of questioning, much less what Stephenson is building toward in the end. I very nearly put down the book in the middle of this section; despite intercutting it with Y.T.'s mafia antics, it was a slog to read. I pressed on though, since I was already at least 50% invested in the book.

Once we have this immense amount of information in front of us, we can't possibly sort it out ourselves. Later in the book, Hiro has a conversation with other characters in which he summarizes everything we'd previously heard in just a few pages; I interpreted this as Stephenson saying, ""Yeah, I know that was super convoluted and you couldn't possibly figure it out on your own. Here you go."" I would have much preferred a slower delivery method for this info that allowed us to digest pieces thoroughly before moving onto the next, and hopefully presented more creatively than essentially having a walking, talking history textbook read you a few lessons from Sumer 101.

All that being said, I found the revelation that all this confusion leads up to very compelling, a mix of ancient and future concepts coming together nicely. From what I've heard, this is Stephenson's specialty. Once I understood everything he was trying to tell me, it became a fascinating study of human origins and religion as they connect to modern day computing and hacking. It's an idea that I've never seen come together quite like this before.

In the interest of length, I'm gonna cut off my ramblings before I get way too specific. Like I said at the beginning, I enjoyed the book overall; amidst colossal dumps of information lies a very fun, creative, and sarcastic science-fiction novel that has surprising depth in spite of its premise. Take a gander if you like sci-fi, though be warned, it takes time and concentration to get through.

**TL/DR: Good, creative sci-fi, but bogged down in dumps of information that can easily halt a reader's progress.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4vlpb6/thoughts_on_snow_crash_mostly_spoilerfree_not/,2016-08-01T09:45:09Z,23,15,books,It Ends with Us,POST
3fmwwn,"Just finished 1984, really hated how it played out. [Full Spoilers]","As the title suggests, I just finished working through 1984, and though the ending could be seen from a mile away (he would be killed and totalitarianism would win), I was really frustrated with how entirely broken Winston was.  

There was no glint of humanity, no undertone that perhaps deep down, he still would rebel.  Big Brother entirely consumed him.

Winston stopped believing in logic, which was a hard sell.  All the while you're hoping for a glint of his inner strength to break through - but it doesn't! Then he stopped loving Julia because some rats were going to eat his face?  What?! No!  And finally, he loved Big Brother because it was all that was left to fill his heart?  You can't eliminate all emotion except for the love of a omnipotent being.

I understand from a literary perspective what George Orwell was going for here, totalitarianism being complete, and why Winston had to die.  But, I have to fundamentally disagree with his premise that humanity can be downtrodden to such an extent.  That all of humanity, even the best of us, could be taught to be oppressed entirely.  That throughout all of human existence, there was no instinct to rebel remaining.  That we, as people, are capable of letting this happen.

The book may not have been so powerful if Winston had shown some inner fortitude, and a glint of humanity remained in him.  But, it was certainly frustrating when that didn't happen.

24c4ar,Has anyone re-read Fahrenheit 451 recently? It is super eerie...,"Just got done re-reading Fahrenheit 451 and found the similarities between the book and today's society to be very intriguing. Every step the main character makes (Montag) aligns with things I have thought about relating to modern-day governments, most notably the NSA and the constant societal monitoring that takes place. In the book, when the police are on the hunt for Montag and cannot find him, another character assures him ""don't worry, they will find someone else to catch and call Montag."" In the end the news channels claim ""Montag has been captured,"" even though it is simply a citizen the government had kept tabs on just in case they were needed.

Overall, the book is about censorship and how increased control on what can/cannot be said will lead to society's demise. As I look around today I see a lot of governments (Russia, US, China) channeling their nation's view and limiting what they are able to consume.

4n2t57,"Having just finished Atlas Shrugged, here's what I think the best take-aways from it are...","Obviously, Atlas Shrugged spoilers from here on out.

Over the last year or so I've been reading Atlas Shrugged. I've been reading it in-between other books and I've only just finished it, although I completely agree that the book is shoving a macro-objectivist political ideology down my throat I feel like Rand's philosophy *does* have a lot of benefits on a small-scale.

Firstly, let me pre-face this with a disclaimer that Rand has completely redefined binary character creation. Every major character in the book is either an attractive, admirable, genius to be inspired by or they are some despicable, ugly, hateful and spiteful being. What I'm going to try and do is identify what makes the ""good"" characters admirable and apply some depth to them.

___

**Taking Responsibility**

This is definitely the one thing I will start to do and take to heart. The protagonists of Dagny Taggart, Henry Rearden, Francisco d'Anconia etc. all consistently take responsibility for all of their actions. *Yes* they are all ""perfect examples"" of what Rand considers to be the ""ideal"" but this is truly important.

*Know what you want.* It's hammered into us throughout the book that Rearden starts his affair with Dagny because he is madly in love with her. He truly *wants* her, in the same way that Lillian truly *wants* him. Dagny *wants* to run the railroad and innovate and produce and make Taggart Transcontinental the best railroad in the country.

I distinctly remember a chapter in the first section for being about 30 pages about Francisco's childhood and upbringing, only to culminate in a 2 page encounter with Dagny that *genuinely* sparked my intrigue into what the fuck was going on here and those 30 pages were there to show us that Francisco *knew* what he wanted out of life.

In opposition to this, James Taggart and co are consistently portrayed as being so unsure of what they want to do. They use flimsy terms that hold no real meaning in an attempt to portray their desires and this, more than anything, bugged me the most about them. I feel like Rand didn't even know what she wanted these characters to desire until she was nearing the end of her book and only figured it out in the chapter of Cheryl's death (More on this later).

___

**Earning Rewards is what is important**

Here's where I feel Rand's characters actually do cross some boundaries and have some depth. The vast majority of lead characters we see in the book come from rich homes whether they are a protagonist or an antagonist. So, as you would expect, they were obviously quite spoiled as children. However, one sentence from quite early on in the book stuck with me:

> *""celebrations should be only for those who have something to celebrate""*

This quote can be taken on a smaller level as ""Rewards are for those who work for them"".

There is a moment in the middle of the book where James meets Cheryl and she falls in love with him under the assumption that he has actively worked for his rewards, later on he starts to despise her because she learned the truth about him and has realised that she doesn't love him although he begs her to love him unconditionally irrelevant of whether or not he has earned it.

We can see this in life generally, how do you lose weight for example? You put in time and effort to run a caloric deficit. How do you get into a healthy, solid relationship? You put in time and effort to meet people and find someone you click with. You have *to do* something, and it's the *doing* that makes you deserve the reward. Counselors and therapists often refer to this as ""delayed gratification"" but I feel like it's something more, it's not just that postponing it means you can look forward to it, it's that the effort you put in for it makes it that much sweeter.

___

**Every action by every person is, to some extent, selfish**

The one thing that *every* character in the book has in common is that they act selfishly. Dagny, Rearden, Jim, and Boyle for example, act in the name of getting a shit-load of money for themselves. Cuffy Meigs, Lillian Rearden, Ma Chalmers, and Mr Thompson act in the name of gaining political power. Ragnar Danneskjöld , Hugh Akston, Balph Eubank and Simon Pritchett all act in the name of philosophical forwarding. And so on and on and on...

What's different about the protagonists is that they are all aware that they act selfishly. I vehemently disagree with many of the reasons that Rand shoe-horns in as the reasons for selfless acts by them (For example, Rearden has little logical reason to still support the wet nurse after his death). Yet the antagonists like to act as if they are acting selflessly when their actual goals are entirely selfish. James wants to be appreciated and loved and treated like a king. Pritchett and Eubank want people to agree with their philosophy to feel some self-validation etc.

I think being self-aware in this, and understanding why we do certain things is important. Of course, this is no excuse to act like an absolute bell-end and act like a selfish, entitled prick *but* I think that even selfless acts have some selfishness in them. Giving to charity is often used as a tool to reduce guilt for those members of society who feel as if they've profited off of other peoples loss, we help our friends with their problems because we like to keep them around and have someone to confide in.

___

**Finally, to achieve happiness, you have to love yourself**

This is something that has been touted for so long by so many people but it's only in reading Atlas Shrugged that I've found a way to make it click in my head. In my head I picture all the antagonists as either insect-like, fat slobs or just downright creepy where I picture all the protagonists as gods gift to humankind. Near the end Rand actively compares Galt's nude body to that of an ancient Greek statue (Clearly Atlas) and (say what you will) but putting yourself in a position to love yourself is a big goal to work towards.

___

So here's my take-away from it. I really want to discuss this book in depth with others, it's obvious that Rand's philosophy is horrifically idealistic and just won't work in the real world. But this is why she is renowned as an Author, not a Politician or an Economist.

99mqg9,The Void Trilogy - Not as good I hoped it would be - Personal Opinion,"The Void Trilogy – Peter F Hamilton,


10 days ago I finished the Void Trilogy, but it has taken me up to this point to decide what to say about it. 


As an initial summary, it was not what I had hoped for it to be, and in my opinion far from Peter F Hamilton’s best work. Looking back on the trilogy, and this is a harsh judgement, I really feel that it has been written to order for a pay cheque. 


Now given my rather blunt appraisal above you may wonder why I read all three books if I feel this way?  Simple really, I purchased all three novels in the same transaction as I felt that PFH was a relatively safe bet. I was also happy to return to the commonwealth as I had enjoyed Pandora’s Star and Judas Unchained. 


The trilogy follows two broad threads / settings – Inigo’s Dreams of Edeard in the Void, and then everything else happening in the commonwealth outside the Void.


For the most part the Edeard chapters were actually quite good, there is a lot more fantasy than sci-fi in the void, with the plot there overall a psychic powered detective story. Edeard though a bit of a ‘Mary Sue’ was actually a quite engaging character. The big bad plotline in the void was pretty well telegraphed, no real surprises at all, but was genuinely enjoyable until about halfway through The Evolutionary Void. 


Outside the Void however, the Commonwealth characters barely felt even 2 dimensional. The plotline here was so stretched out but there was really nothing of substance of consequence happening for 85% of the time. Aaron was the only character that generated any interest, if only to find out who this amnesiac, overpowered assassin really is. 


Even revisiting old characters again, it was just bland. The only reason to keep reading was to see if anything would happen at all, and to get through the pages back to Inigo’s dreams. As a reader the whole plotline here could have been handled with a few prelude chapters, and then 2 – 4 at the end, focusing on Inigo’s dreams and maybe dropping a whole novel. 
The annoyance with these chapters being dragged out is compounded by how easily readable they are, yes nothing is happening and I was not invested, but it was easy enough to keep reading hoping for better. 


By far the greatest disappointment of all though is upon reaching the end of The Trilogy, absolutely nothing of consequence or character development had really occurred due to how the story ended.


For anyone looking for a Peter F Hamilton book to read after Pandora’s Star and Judas Unchained, I’d recommend you skip The Void Trilogy, go read The Reality Dysfunction trilogy instead. That at least was highly entertaining, at least in my opinion, I have read that trilogy a few times now.


Of course there may be some big PFH fans here, and if you really love his work – then dive right in, this is just my opinion alone. I felt it was worth to share as I had really liked the other PFH books I read until this series, and perhaps I could save a few others some disappointment.


Spoilers below –
[Spoilers below](#s ""Within the Void – Edeard discovers he can endlessly rewind time to correct mistakes going back decades. This is hard on him having to keep reliving many past events. Sometimes he screws up badly, but every time, even when he saved the world he could in the end never save Salrana. Except that this till the last chapter, after everyone in the void was dead and fulfilled except Salrana. Edeard was wished back to life to help Justine and just before the Void collapsed he wished a young innocent Salrana back to life, so that he could live a life with her and finally save her. 
Seriously WTF, this was the only curse that Edeard had left to bear, such happy whimsical ending ultimately robs the story of any moral or satisfaction. "")

[Spoilers - more](#s ""Similarly the End of the Void – and saving of the commonwealth.  They simply wind back time in the Void to when it was created and ‘ask’ the First Life to turn it off, because the Void will one day destroy the Galaxy – and so they do. Level 99 space magic here folks. 
Once again humans can’t save themselves or solve their own problems, and rely on a benign entity with untold powers to pick up the pieces and fix everything for us.
Even Gore’s sacrifice here is without consequence, yes he ascended to non-physical status to help show the First Life than species can live and evolve in the ‘normal galaxy’ but its robbed of any meaningfulness as a copy of him is just downloaded in the end from ANA and so Gore is safe, just missing a couple of weeks of memory. 
Oh and, all the commonwealth humans in the void just wish for the people they want to be real before it collapses and everyone, except The Cat and Illanthe have a happy ending."")

[Spoilers - summary](#s ""All in all the scope of the books just felt so small, and poorly written, just for any meaningful resolution to be robbed in the last chapter by a heavy dose of Space Magic.  
To be fair the Reality Dysfunction, also used a heavy dose of space magic for the resolution too, but the story there was at least more engaging, left me with some questions, and did have some material consequences. Honestly even though the Void Trilogy was written after, it feels like a way more inexperienced and poorly conceived series than his Reality Dysfunction trilogy."")

6pqdkl,"Has it always been popular to explain simple things in complicated ways? I feel like every book I read is written as a detective novel. Authors tell their stories out of order, and put obvious effort into hiding keys to the plot. Reading just feels like a string of cheap rewards.","The cheap rewards come from the micro-successes of having to constantly deconstruct things that have been overcomplicated on purpose.

For example Im on ch.15 of a book and they start it off with nothing familiar, 30 pages of rambling nonsense, then they finally reveal at the end of the chapter that theyve been talking from the perspective of the main characters as a boy. 

My favorite reading feeling is when you finally get into a book. The first few chapters are always a task until you decide you like it, and then its easy street. So I feel pissed when authors break me out of my love trance with their book by starting a completely new story halfway through the book and thinking they dont need to tell me how it relates to the main story for 30 pages. Its rude as far as Im concerned, because here I am reading one book and then they switch to a completely different book for 30 pages without saying a word about how it connects to the story you like and have already commited to. Im sure people will say it adds re-read value and whatnot, but I feel like allot of mediocre books are coming out because so many of us proud gumshoes mistake the rewarding feeling of finding/arranging all the pieces, for the rewarding feeling of reading a good book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6pqdkl/has_it_always_been_popular_to_explain_simple/,2017-07-26T19:16:43Z,14,15,books,It Ends with Us,POST
8a044k,"Fans of detective novels or classic mystery stories who have yet to read *The Moonstone* by Wilkie Collins, do yourself a favor: read it.","I'm currently enrolled in a British Literature Class at my university and this was the novel assigned for us to read periodically throughout the course.  Our teacher seemed extremely excited for us to go through it and gauge our responses after each section.  Despite a little skepticism on my part initially as I am not a huge mystery novel fan, I can say that this is one of my favorite books in a long time.

For a book that came out in the late 1800's, it reads surprisingly modern.  The wittiness of the several fleshed-out narrators gives the novel such a great flow and rhythm.  While the book is relaying the mystery of a stolen (possibly cursed) rare diamond after these events have already occurred, the narrators are relaying the story to the reader through journals and correspondence in sequential order, switching characters once their knowledge of what happened has run dry.  It creates this great sense of irony, having characters who already know how the story ends and make subtle hints or comments about how a certain moment or comment was overlooked by them and could have possibly stopped this whole mess from happening, whereas the reader is simply trying to figure everything out for themselves as best as they can.

Like I mentioned before, the book reads wonderfully for something written 150 years ago.  Not only does the pacing and writing feel modern, but many of the characters that Wilkie Collins created have since become archetypes for the classic detective novels we know today: red herrings, the most obvious suspect trying to clear their name, bumbling local police officers, the brilliant detective who sees the bigger picture before anyone else, etc.

While I have yet to actually read any Sherlock Holmes novels, I feel like this book has raised the bar for them, in a sense, once I finally get around to them.  While Sherlock Holmes is an iconic literary figure in and of himself, I just cannot get over the fact that Collins created so many memorable characters that practically leapt off the page.  From duty-driven and skeptical Head House-Steward Betteridge to the intelligent,yet ignorant Franklin to the fiery and compassionate Rachel to the misunderstood and tragic Rosanna.  The list goes on and on.

I cannot sing praises enough about this book.  The book is far from perfect and there are definitely some areas where the plot sort of stops for a bit out of nowhere, but overall this was a wonderful novel and foray into the first English detective novel ever written.  If you are a fan of classic British literature and have not read this, it is more than worth your time.  If you aren't sure that you enjoy British lit, yet enjoy ""Downton Abbey"" or even the film ""Gosford Park"" and want to read a mystery that simultaneously tackles social status in 19th century England, it is definitely worth checking out.

If you feel like you need to sample it before investing in it completely, [I'm posting a link here to Dickens Journal Online](http://www.djo.org.uk/all-the-year-round/volume-xix/page-73.html) directly to the first three chapters that Collins had published in the *All The Year Round* publication.  Collins continually submitted three or four chapters per issue to this publication for the public to read before compiling them together in book form.  You could actually read *The Moonstone* for free through this site and get to check out some awesome short stories and other publications of this era.  The interface takes a little getting used to, but you'll get the hang of it after a few minutes messing around with it.

d1yrnl,"""A River Runs Through It"" ending discussion","I have always thought that the last page of Norman MacLean’s *A River Runs Through It* contains some of the most beautiful prose I have ever read. That being said, I still struggle to decipher the meaning of all of it, and I would love to hear other people's interpretations.

**The text:**

""Like many fly fishermen in western Montana where the summer days are almost Arctic in length, I often do not start fishing until the cool of the evening. Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise.

Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs.

I am haunted by waters.""

**Questions:**

Does this passage have a concrete message or is its poetry an end in itself?

What do the objects in the passage (the river, the rocks, the raindrops, the words, the waters) represent?

**My Interpretation:**

A shift in the passage occurs in the last line of the first paragraph as Maclean transitions from straightforward narrative to abstract prose. This prose is not intended to convey a simple lesson for readers to extract, but rather to create a metaphysical sensation that speaks to the relationship between man, nature, and time.

The second paragraph explores how our individual lives and collective histories merge to form a unified portrait of the human condition; a portrait intimately tied to the natural world (""the river""). Nature is timeless and eternal, reflected by the imagery of, ""rocks from the basement of time,"" bearing the experiences and memories (""the timeless raindrops"") of those who came before us. Over the courses of our lives, we each develop a certain connection with the natural world. The ""words"" under the rocks symbolize these connections - they are the imprints we leave behind from our relationship to the environment.

*A River Runs Through It* examines Maclean's personal relationship with nature. For him, nature, the river, the water, calls him back to his childhood. It haunts him because it is an image of what he once had, and a reminder of what he has lost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/d1yrnl/a_river_runs_through_it_ending_discussion/,2019-09-09T23:05:26Z,4,23,books,It Ends with Us,POST

b8nb2d,I just finished reading Dave Cullen's Columbine a few minutes ago. I picked it up on a whim and it has rocked my world. Some thoughts. Possible spoilers.,"It's rocked my mind, too.

&#x200B;

I came across this book at my local bookseller the day after I was discharged from the psychiatric ward after a six week long stay.  I'd attempted suicide.  I had second thoughts about the purchase before making it.  I felt like it would put me in a bad place.  I had gone there looking for a much more upbeat piece of non-fiction but they were sold out.  But, I figured since I was only halfway through the book I was reading then, that it would give me enough time to stabilize more.  In case you are curious, I've got a history of self harm and suicide attempts, anxiety and panic attacks, bipolar disorder, PTSD, but I have never been violent.  I'm a 26 year old woman.

&#x200B;

I started reading Columbine right before Valentine's Day of this year.  It's usually hard for me to get started reading because I know I'll be sitting down for hours or staying up very late because I can't put it down.  This book was the opposite.  Most chapters and sections I could only read in short bursts due to the thoughts provoked and subject matter.  I didn't finish it, as the title says, until *today--almost six weeks later.*  I finally broke down reading Cullen's thoughts on how the media should respond to these events, how schools could implement simple strategies to spot and respond to teens suffering with depression, self harm, or suicidal ideation, how Dylan Klebold's mother handled the aftermath, and how the survivors felt numb around 24-48 hours after the shooting ended.

&#x200B;

This book made me think about things I hadn't given much thought to before when thinking about these mass shootings.  How the survivors respond, especially in the short-term (instead of the typical heavy focus on the attackers and victims), how the survivors' families respond and change--sometimes forever, how local communities and societies respond (and often fail to change), how these communities can inadvertently make the fallout worse or the likelihood of a copycat incident increase simply by responding with their gut like most people would.

&#x200B;

I'm a white woman in the southern US.  On April 20th, 2009, my junior year of high school, two brothers had one of their friends call in a bomb threat and then they called the school to say they were coming to ""shoot it up.""  They never made it to the school and no bombs were ever found, but we were on lockdown for several hours then released from school early.  I remember one of my friends sitting beside me saying about an hour in:  ""Isn't today the 10th anniversary of Columbine?""  Then, when we could finally leave, that was being repeated everywhere.  Everyone was shaken, from students to staff.  Stories like mine are often the best-case scenario.

&#x200B;

Dave Cullen wrote beautifully and compiled information masterfully to show the past, present, and future impact.  It was hard to get through the book, but I feel like I'm better for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/b8nb2d/i_just_finished_reading_dave_cullens_columbine_a/,2019-04-02T18:54:55Z,15,29,books,It Ends with Us,POST
8sj4ti,1984 Discussion/Contextualization HELP (SPOILERS maybe idk it was published like 70 years ago but still),"Sorry if this is a bit long-winded or breaks sub rules. Just finished Orwell's 1984/The Last Man in Europe and I'm having a much harder time contextualizing it with my worldviews than other books and I'd like some help (don't worry, I'm not adverse to challenging said worldviews but bear with me). I really enjoyed the parts about geopolitics, fascism and nationalism and how they can be applied today (spending billions on a war that isn't ever fought or won, unscrutinizing patriotism, etc). What I'm left confused about is the part about **\[SPOILERS\]** >!controlling thoughts being equal to omnipotence. Like when O'Brien (er whatever his name really was, I don't think Orwell actually said if it was his real name) was saying ""If I tell you I'm flying and you believe it, then I have lifted off the ground"" and Winston agrees, after some convincing. !<

Now, I'm no objectivist. I despise Ayn Rand and after slogging through Fountainhead (don't ask, barely remember a word) decided I would have nothing to do with objectivism. But the human experience is so limited compared to the vast universe we've only begun to understand. I kinda get what O'Brien was saying about owning minds being the same as controlling matter, but I just don't buy it. At the very least, the dark age brought on by Ingsoc would eventually lead to the technologically inept societies of the three super powers being destroyed by asteroid or supervolcano or climate change and no amount of societal control could change that. Who knows, maybe that'll end up happening to us anyways?

Still, I'd like to know if that was really Orwell's actual thesis or if O'Brien's position didn't match Orwell's. I tried to look into it, but I'll admit I'm still a student (figuratively and literally) at reading in-depth. In other cases, it's been obvious when authors really agree with what characters say, but I'm really having trouble placing this.

34zvf8,Just finished The Crying of Lot 49 and hated it. What am I missing?,"I don't get it. I found the book frustratingly directionless and difficult. Directionless because Pynchon seemed to delight in bizarre chance encounters with minor (or even one-shot) characters who explain something that may or may not be true and then disappear, leaving their explanation unable to be followed up on. The book build toward nothing but leaving you in uncertainty about the major conflict. Difficult because it revels in byzantine explanations of fake politics that seem designed to simply lose the reader at some point.

I've read that the book is supposed to be funny, but I didn't see the humor. A review talks about its highly structured ""symbolic order"" or something, but that was lost on me too. Many things seemed to suggest deep symbolic meaning, without ever delivering on that promise. (e.g., Why ""Mike Fallopian"" who is first seen in a **wet suit**. Does he have something to do with birth or rebirth or female sexuality? I expected to see that followed up on, and didn't find it.) The book flap promises that Oedipa learns a ""not inconsiderable"" amount about herself, but I certainly didn't see that, nor do I feel like I understand her much better at the end of the book than I did at the beginning. 

So all that to say that at the end of it, I feel that I the reader, like Oedipa, was probably just led on a wild goose chase that I badly wanted to mean something but it really didn't. Neither of us are any wiser for the hours we spent chasing down meaning. I feel sort of like the butt of a really abstruse literary joke, but I'm not laughing along. (Am I supposed to?)

But I know that it's a classic of postmodern fiction, so I wonder what I'm missing. Can someone explain?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/34zvf8/just_finished_the_crying_of_lot_49_and_hated_it/,2015-05-05T22:59:22Z,3,3,books,It Ends with Us,POST

Perhaps we were victims of one another.” The cold dark nebulous wonder that is Anna Kavan's ICE","This is was an incredible, enigmatic read for me. I wasn't quite sure what I was getting myself into but ICE ended up being a surprising, daring, and powerful work of fiction that I will be thinking about for some time to come. 

The world is being consumed by this encroaching, unexplainable wall of ice like some kind of sub-kelvin reality virus that freezes time and space. It is not so much an ice-age as it is an abstract, alien horror whose origin is beyond what can be known. Entire countries become dark and inaccessibly frozen while the remaining habitable zones are being slowly consumed by bureaucracy, suspicion, panic, and a murderous fascist-costumed blood lust. 

An unnamed chameleon with a compulsive urge to possess and destroy something beautiful seeks a monochromatic girl from his past with ""albino hair that illuminated my dreams, shining brighter than moonlight."" Whether he intends to rescue her from the cold or if he is chasing a claim of ownership over her body is unclear and possibly even one in the same. There is this element of his past self, or his true self, being a separate entity and the voice that haunts the first-person account of ICE could be the split personality of a military dictator rising to power in a world on the brink of its own destruction, or maybe even something more subconsciously Jungian and alchemical is at play. 

“She herself did not seem quite real. She was pale and almost transparent, the victim I used for my own enjoyment in dreams.” 

""It was clear that he regarded her as his property. I considered that she belonged to me. Between the two of us she was reduced to nothing; her only function might have been to link us together. His face wore the look of extreme arrogance which always repelled me. Yet I suddenly felt an incredible affinity with him, a sort of blood-contact, generating confusion, so I began to wonder if there *were* two of us."" 

I really dig these strange dark odyssey books like Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Steven Wright's Going Native, and J. G. Ballard's The Drowned World where characters driven by ambiguous motivations trespass deeper with each chapter into stranger and stranger territory where the stakes feel more real than real, becoming lost in this like primal underverse of reality, almost leaving their lives behind and transgressing physically into a cavernous psychological realm of no return. 

Highly recommended.

4a0fgv,[Spoilers!] I Rage-quit my second book and this time it feels great!,"The first book I rage quit was the fifth Harry Potter book. I couldn't get past Harry's whining mid-way and shelved it. After talking with a friend who knows exactly where I was, he says it gets better almost immediately, so I may go back soon.

I just quit ""And another thing..."" by Eoin Colfer. I read Artemis Fowl when I was younger and thought it was fun and adventurey, if it did seem like he was also trying to write the screenplay at the same time. I finished Mostly harmless last year and it felt complete. I felt complete. I cracked AAT open, excited to see another authors voice pick up the story (though I can't imagine how).

Spoilers: at the end of MH, the 5th in the Hitchhiker's Guide series, Vogons destroy the last earth and Arthur, Trillian, alternate Earth Tricia, their daughter Random, and Ford all die. It's beautiful and makes sense.

So about halfway in, Wowbagger the infinitely prolonged is making out with Trillian after drugging and somewhat mutilating Random, Arthur is just depressing, spending all his time watching sexy computer simulations of Fenchurch, Ford is just getting drunk and buying things on the sub etha network, and Zaphod is convincing Thor to kill Wowbagger after he loses his confidence on what is basically a youtube prank.

I'm not familiar with Colfer's other stuff, but it feels like he's been in young adult books so long that he got the chance to insert adult themes, and he went crazy with it, making almost every character intoxicated by the 50th page, while also trying to be relevant by creating sci-fi versions of youtube and other social media sites, while trying to invoke content from the trilogy. Characters are referencing details from the trilogy with no prior memory of it (Hillman and the bugblatter beast), Arthur isn't even hilariously depressing. Ford is up to no new hi-jinks (still trying to run up his charge card). It feels like they still got destroyed and we're only looking at their ghosts, still stuck in a loop from when they were last alive.

I'll grant that the Nano God search storyline is honestly funny and reminds us of Adams's attitude about organized religion, and it was keeping me invested, and the guide cutaways is an interesting mechanic. Overall, it feels tired. I read one too many ""Pormwrangler""s and was done.

5a1d0j,"I finally got around to reading 'Everything I Never Told You"" by Celeste Ng and I have nowhere to discuss it","I really wanted to love that book because I like family dramas. One of my favorite books is *The Sound and the Fury*, which is actually name-dropped in *Everything I Never Told You*. I thought it was an enjoyable read, it was quite the page-turner and I felt compelled to learn about the history of the family, but I also found it cliché and unbelievable.

There's a lot of repetition in the book. For instance, the author constantly repeats the phrase ""character thought blablabla, although she wouldn't admit it to herself"". I also thought it was lame that all the white people had blue eyes and blond hair, as if that is what defines white people. I also cringed at the half-Asian daughter with blue eyes who ""defies genetic"" or whatever the author called it. I thought it was really shallow that her dad liked her better because she had blue eyes.

Speaking of shallow, the smallest events become life-changing milestones in *Everything I Never Told You*. The dad completely gives up on his son because the other kids got out of the pool while he was playing Marco Polo. The whole thing is treated like the meanest prank in history. I've been the subject of that exact prank many times in my life. I'm pretty sure anyone who's ever played Marco Polo has been the subject of this prank. Why is everyone acting so upset about it?

Then there's the mom, who is a completely cliché textbook stereotype of The Tiger Mom. But The Tiger Mom is an Asian concept and here the mom is white. So the author wrote a stereotypical Asian Tiger Mom in an Asian family, but decided to make it the white parent instead of the Asian parent, and now that's supposed to be an original take. It just seemed implausible to me.

Finally, and I think that's my biggest annoyance with the book, the main daughter, who's at the center of all the drama, is a total unlikable brat with no redeemable qualities. She's not smart, she's not popular, she's not nice, but the way the author makes it sound, she's the poor victim in all this, and her only flaw is being loved too much. Every single time her brother brings up Harvard, she has to upstage him by dropping some sort of bomb on the family. She hides his letters and the second his life and thoughts don't revolve around her she gets pissed off and sets off to sleep with his enemy. We're supposed to have sympathy for her because she died and she had a ""hard"" life, but she didn't. She was horrible.

Anyway, that's my thoughts. I also thought the ending was weird. Why does the author tell something nobody else knows? I get it, it's an omniscient narrator, but the book was being coy about what the daughter really did when she was alone. We got most of the information from when other characters were around her, except in the very end. I would have preferred if the book left us wondering what really happened because all the other characters are left wondering.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5a1d0j/i_finally_got_around_to_reading_everything_i/,2016-10-29T16:55:06Z,7,9,books,It Ends with Us,POST
gerwr9,I picked up Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind after sourcing the referral from Kazu Kibuishi's blog (creator of Amulet). It has been one the most sublime reading experiences of my first Manga style book!,"My oh my! What a *fantastic* book! I've only recently picked up Graphic Novels - after Bone, Nimona and Amulet I read Nausicaa after seeing it mentioned as an inspiration for Kazu Kibuishi (the creator of the Amulet series) on his [blog](https://www.boltcityproductions.com/amulet).

Initially I was apprehensive about a black and white (BW) comic and after realizing no color prints are available in the US I ordered the complete two volume BW tomes. The art is definitely compelling. At times I couldn't really understand the rendition given the BW perception (or an erroneous one on my part) but a hard stare or two would fix it.

It was my first manga-style comic too - so took a while to get adjusted to the right-to-left reading style. At times the flow didn't make sense so would redo to make sure I followed it correctly. I was equally amazed at the no-dialogue-action-sequences across multiple panels. Even though the ""sounds"" were written in Japanese calligraphy, my brain still managed to fill 'em in. I later realized that the end of the book lists the sound-translation index for the panels; which IMO is a too cumbersome to use as a key. I preferred my brain picking up the cues from the graphics and filling it in. At times though it was really hard to tell ""what"" the scene was trying to show and what sound my brain should add it. A bit of struggling and it became almost intuitive midway through.

The excitement, the story telling, character development the way the emotions exude from the page made for a wonderful epic! I couldn't put the book down and every downtime I had between work, kids and life, I'd run to read a few pages. In about 2 weeks I finished both the \~500 page tomes and loved every moment of it. Some folks said the story is slow - however I feel it's ""well paced"" if you're absorbed into it.

It was a magnificent rendition that I would strongly recommend!! I'm surprised to find it so low in rankings on lists on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/210.Best_Graphic_Novels#626339). Honestly, had it not be ""recommended"" by Kazu Kibuishi, I too may have not picked it up.

In fact, I may just begin to warm up to the Manga style too. I'm a sucker for fantasy and perhaps well in love with Nausicaa - literally and figuratively.

(Sidebar: I did some reading into meta-manga, to understand why it is the way it is and what it's strengths are and now I have a much better appreciation of the medium. Will definitely explore other manga to appreciate the stories in a general sense ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gerwr9/i_picked_up_nausicaa_valley_of_the_wind_after/,2020-05-06T20:31:04Z,12,28,books,It Ends with Us,POST
3vw9qb,[Discussion] Hemingway's Farewell to Arms - Discussion with my Dad... Feel free to add to it!,"**Specifically this passage:**

If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.

**Dad says (teasingly)**: 

Next time quote Hemingway telling us how great it feels to land the big fish.

**I respond**: 

Here's how I interpret the passage; whether the fish is caught or not is of no relevance. Time will kill the fish, you, and everything else...yet the world continues to spin and life goes on. I think it's really much more beautiful than morbid. Hemingway's point is that we shouldn't worry about the smaller things (of which ourselves as individuals is a part) because in the end they don't matter at all. It's a very reassuring constant.

**Daddio says:**

Or - because we all eventually die - the exhilaration of catching that fish (and our other experiences) is all that does matter. 

**I (beginning to acquiesce) say:** 

I'm also looking at it another way now too. He says that those who get broken become stronger in the broken places afterward. I like that. He's saying that the courageous will be broken, but that their breaking makes them stronger. It's those who refuse to be broken will be killed (spiritually and rationally). It's a message to learn from our mistakes and accidents. Those who can't grow, die. We must improve (but in the end too we still die).

**Dad has the final wisdom (as always):**

So is that the proverbial willow tree or the oak tree approach? Hard to tell. Is it the willow that gets bent but gets stronger from the bending, and the rigid oak that refuses and is killed? Or does the rigid oak get broken and comes back stronger? I'm betting on the willow.

**My buddy later added:**

I always felt that it was a jab at those don't strive to be anything. They're never targeted by the world and are therefore left behind and killed as an afterthought.
Those who aren't very strong or very weak are so because they have not put themselves through any extremes...[they] are pathetic in a way.


Now the fun part. Do you agree with any of us? Disagree? Feel that we're all missing something?

8pkaz8,"I recently read the dystopian classic 'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley. Since I can't stop thinking about it, here are my musings on the theme of predetermination versus free will in the novel.","> '*...that is the secret of happiness and virtue – liking what you've* got *to do. All conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny.*'  

I recently finished reading *Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley, and it's for me one of those reads that get you into a contemplative mood and stay in the back of your mind long after you have put the book down, refusing to let go and compelling you to toss and turn it over and over in your head.  

It's been a few years since I read *1984* by George Orwell - another prominent dystopian novel that's often brought up in discussions of *Brave New World* and vice versa - but I distinctly remember feeling this strange mix of unsettlingness and morbid curiosity while reading it due to some of the concepts it delineates and the underlying idea that these could come to pass in practice in the future and may in fact be happening in the present reality. And now while reading *Brave New World*, I felt something similar, but the unsettling feeling was only more intense in this case.  

I gave it some thought and I feel like it's chiefly because, while *1984* presents a totalitarian regime that controls its subjects by means of coercion and perpetual surveillance, *Brave New World* depicts a 'softer form of totalitarianism' - as Margaret Atwood puts it in her introduction to the novel - and yet a highly effective one where people are psychologically conditioned to unquestioningly accept their predetermined functions in society and whatever else is meted out to them in life. It's not merely that they're deprived of any alternatives, but they're also inherently *incapable* of feeling the need for an alternative in the first place. It's one thing to be coerced into a way of life that you *know* you're unhappy with but have seemingly no way to escape from, but it's another thing altogether to have your psyche be deliberately configured in a way such that not only you don't realise the gravity of your own situation but also you find *satisfaction* in it and can't comprehend the idea of anything outside of it.  

Essentially, the very concept of free will is done away with. This is a world where one's role and functions in society, their preferences and inclinations, and their dominant personalities, attitudes, outlooks, and quirks are all predetermined at the stage of one's conception, and then later reinforced through a series of systematic behavioural conditioning sessions to the effect that these become synonymous with what we call instincts ('As if one believed anything by instinct! One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them.'). No one really has the choice to *explore* and decide for themselves what they want or do not want, not because they're being held at gun point but because they've been *programmed* to be content with the existing state of affairs to the extent of never wanting to consider having things any other way (and when any glitch in the form of overwhelming emotions or deviating thoughts pops up, it's promptly terminated with a dose of *soma*). Neil Postman put it succinctly in *Amusing Ourselves to Death*: 'What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one'.  

And to me, from a third-person perspective that lies outside the system of this world, such a scenario is terrifying and tragic.  

This realisation hit me like a truck when at one point towards the end of the novel, the Savage - John - attempts to incite the lower-caste Deltas into rebellion against their subservient way of life and against *soma*-intake as the society's legally sanctioned means to quell any emotion deemed undesirable, but in vain. The Savage's emotionally-charged words fall on deaf ears as the Deltas have been deliberately engineered to possess inferior mental faculty, rendering them incapable of comprehending anything outside the requirements of their menial jobs. The mental image of hundreds of Deltas and Epsilons with indistinguishable faces filing in and out of elevators and going about their monotonous jobs (which, owing to their conditioning, they don't find so) reminded me of the Hands - the factory workers who have been dehumanised and reduced to only a pair of hands by their capitalist maters - in Charles Dickens' *Hard Times*. But while the Hands are at least *aware* of their circumstances and how these circumstances affect them even if they can't do anything about it, the common masses of the World State are bereft of even the luxury of self-awareness.   

That being said, perhaps the true ingenuity of *Brave New World* lies in the author's ability to simultaneously convince the reader of the appeal and upsides of the book's universe for those who inhabit it specifically and also in general terms, while also conveying this lingering feeling of there being something very wrong with this world - walking the fine line between utopia and dystopia.   

A well-crafted dystopia is one that expertly wears the garb of a utopia, and the World State certainly passes this test with flying colours for the champions of this society do make some sound arguments in its defense, and one almost wants to *believe* them. For instance, they do have a point in that a great deal of misery in life often stems from dissatisfaction with one's obligations - their jobs, responsibilities, and roles - but if people are made to like what they've got to do, then there's no scope for dissatisfaction in the first place, and it follows then that everyone's happy with their life. At one level, it sounds convincing enough. Rather than having a bunch of unhappy employees slaving away at their workstations, wouldn't it be a more desirable situation to have these employees be conditioned in a way such that they find the work pleasant? The employer wants to get work done and the employees are always happy to do it, regardless of the nature of the work. That makes it a win-win situation for both the employer and the employees.   

And *yet*, there's something about this whole thing that feels wrong deep down.   

As far as my understanding goes, it's because the implication of such an arrangement is that people are being stripped off their free will and power to make informed choices. As humans, we're distinct from other animals in our self-awareness and intelligence, and in a way that's both a blessing and a curse. By taking away the power to think and explore and take decisions for *ourselves*, and limiting us to a set of predetermined configurations, we're in effect being deprived of what makes us *human*.   

The people of World State have paid their price for 'happiness and stability'. Do *we* want to? It's not quite a black-and-white picture, and this ambivalence is what makes *Brave New World* so utterly intriguing and thought-provoking.

auushr,"Jim Mullen's ""It Takes A Village Idiot"" enraptured me over the weekend","Allow me to lay the scene. 

My friends and I had planned a weekend getaway to upstate NY for the last two months. We'd rented the house, and had taken the required days off of work. We arrived late Friday night and after a long day of driving and preparing, we immediately set to bed.

Saturday arose, and with it, a subconscious need to take advantage of our time here, to ensure we didn't waste all our long evenings of planning. We hiked, we explored, we traveled the city and the sights it had to offer. Afternoon arrived and our group of five split. 

Three decided to head to a shop they had noticed, mayhaps a bric-a-brac may be found that would resurrect memories of the present day, in the future. Two, with me being one, retired back to the house for some well-needed rest. We arrived, the resident dog awaited us with wagging tail, and the wooden stove was quickly lit. A picture perfect weekend scene.

I noticed a small book on the coffee table with an enticing title. With a little light reading on my mind, I opened it and begin the adventure. Unwittingly I was drawn into a parallel universe with terrifying similarities to the journey we had taken ourselves. I had to look up when the book was written to ensure we hadn't written it ourselves. It was published in 2002.

Nearly twenty years have passed since Jim Mullen wrote ""It Takes A Village Idiot: A Memoir of Life after the City"" and nearly nothing has changed. His depictions of life in NYC as a successful columnist enjoying every facet of the Big Apple, the abrasive attitude that permeates the city, the bleakness of the roads to the Appalachia of New York, and nearly every facet was masterfully written and woven into a comedic manner that had me laughing out loud to the point of embarrassment.

There were passages that I had simply no choice but to read aloud to my friend, sharing with him the experience that I knew he would revel in, as there is simply nothing better than realizing you are part of a select few who have first-hand knowledge of what an artist produces. 

The fire crackled, the dog lay peacefully, the sun slowly set, and the silence was broken by the rustling of pages and the occasional burst of words read aloud to a drowsy yet attentive audience. It was indeed, bliss.

Shortly thereafter, from outside, we heard the unmistakable sound of tires, followed by slamming doors, shuffling shoes, and rustling jackets. Our comrades had returned, presumably empty handed as there was a distinct lack of glass clinking. Bric-a-bracs are always made of glass, it is not on me to question why, they simply are. 

Once the excitement had waned, we had caught up on our respective adventures, we sat for dinner. The group, satisfyingly stuffed, ended up in the living room again, as the comfort of the wooden stove tantalized us and left no choice but to be drawn to it. Two lay on the couch, two on the loveseat, one lay on the rug. The home's collection was explored and a CD was produced for ambient music. The speaker was loaded and soft jazz began to fill the room.

As we settled into a comfortable silence, I once again delved into the world Mullen wove and was soon enraptured but this time, I had a full house to share with. As I would find passages that I knew my friends would enjoy, I would simply read them out loud. The depictions of the roads that led to upstate NY, the rusting and decaying equipment on the side of the road, even the people themselves. We had experienced everything he wrote about ourselves.

At some point, the absurdity of it all struck me. Here we are, a group of college students, between 21 and 22, all with standard social skills, fairly outgoing individuals in a town that has two decent sized colleges on a Saturday night, and we are around a fire, listening to a book being read. And I wouldn't change it for the world.

Alas, as all good things do, I finished the book the next morning and fittingly enough, it was then time to leave. As we backed out of the driveway in our baggage laden vehicles, I realized one thing. I am incredibly, incredibly lucky. Referencing a quote from ""The Office,"" I was blessed enough to know that I had experienced one of ""The good old days"" while it happened. This is a memory of mine that will live on forever, and this book will be treasured by me for as long as I live.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/auushr/jim_mullens_it_takes_a_village_idiot_enraptured/,2019-02-26T04:06:04Z,1,10,books,It Ends with Us,POST
6k4ck7,Finally Read Stephen King's IT and Hated Every Page. SPOILERS,"Okay maybe not every page - but at *least* 1273 pages. 

I picked up the book because  *IT* comes out in September and I wanted to be the guy who says, *actually, I read the book and this is what happens.*

Jokes aside, I wanted to finally give Horror-King a try. It was terrible. 

**Let's Begin**

 **TLDR** 7 friends band together after all being targeted by a bully. They realize they all had instances where they have seen something out of the ordinary; a mummy, clown, ghost, werewolf, (IT) etc. They decide they must kill IT. They unknowingly fail, come back as adults and actually kill IT. Derry (their hometown) is destroyed along with IT. 



Who do I blame for this? *IT* isn't about a scary clown like John Wayne Gacy. In fact, Pennywise the Clown isn't even a main character in the book. Pennywise the Clown is as prevalent in *IT* as Andy's mom is in *Toy Story.* I would venture to say that *IT* barely skirts the line of being considered a horror. I thought I was diving into a grotesque horror that will keep me up at night, *IT* isn't that. *IT* doesn't even try to be that - at least it didn't seem that way. 

**Writing Style**

Largely character driven, my biggest complaint is King's writing when it comes to character interaction. *IT* is written as if **Stephen King is an alien**, and he is pretending to know how people interact with each other. It's like King read about humans, but has never been a human himself. It makes *IT* cheesy, and makes me wonder if King is a reptile-person. 

For example, shortly after Eddie has his arm brutally ripped off by a giant Spider (we'll get there) and dies, Richie is asking where he can get breakfast and making jokes. Or Bill shouting *Hi-yo Silver AWAYYYYYY,* every time he rides his dumbass bike, even as an adult. Or how the kids all talk like sailors. Or how Ben always calls Bill, *Big Bill;* underlying sexual theme. Or the most cringeworthy line of all time, *""send him our power!""* *IT* is literally written as if King never had friends before and never was a kid himself. The writing makes the character and story even less believable than it already is.

 to be slightly picky, the nomenclature is dated. As a 24 year old, I felt like I was missing a lot of references, and things like bodybuilders being called ""muscle-builders"" was a little strange. 


**The Protagonists**

Most important to *IT* are the protagonists. However, none of them are endearing. Does anyone like the kids? I mean, in 1400 pages, does anyone grow to love these characters? When they become adults, they don't evolve. I've never been annoyed by a character in a book, but I was literally annoyed while reading Richie's character voices. I'm not sure if Richie was supposed to be flat out annoying, but if that was the case; mission accomplished. All of the characters had the same archetype based around them acting contrary to their outward appearance This made them even less interesting and more cliche.  

- Ben - Fat and clumsy, *but* has a big penis and gets the girl.

- Bill - Stutters and shy, *but* stands tall and brave

- Richie - annoying jokester who picks on his friends, *but* protects his friends

- Eddie - a hypochondriac who always gets hurt

- Beverly - battered woman/girl *but* has more power than the boys

- Stan - likes birds? 

These 6 form the Losers Club, *but* all grow to be huge winners in adulthood (shocking). Why would anyone like this cast? They are 6 losers who; aren't that cool, have purposely unattractive qualities, and (for the most part) can't stand up for themselves in the face of adversity. King prepares a narrative of, **but though the power of friendship, anything is possible!** Give me a break.





**Story Time**


*IT* is largely about Derry, a town. Read your high school state history book and that's what a large potion of *IT* is about. Really. I'm not exaggerating. *IT* is so stuffed full with nothing important, that dozens of pages of the book have little to no relevance. I understand building a narrative around theme. This was excessive. 

 *'The town is this way because that's how the town is, and the town will always be this way because of the history of how the town became the way that it is.'* /synopsis.



The story itself just isn't that interesting. There are no twists or turns. The main antagonist is a bully, Henry. He bullies. Yawn.

**Gangbang Chapter**

Yes. There is a gangbang. Seriously. Does it make any sense? Is it necessary? No. No. I don't know what book on humans Stephen King read, but 11 year olds don't partake in gangbangs. 

Maybe you're confused. What am I talking about? While in the sewers, Beverly takes her clothes off, and helps each of the boys have sex with her in succession. Six of them. **WHAT** 

I think I heard Louis CK say, ""A joke can only be as racist as it is funny."" A book can only warrant a 11 year old gangbang if the book is...... well I don't know what would justify  7 kids getting in on in a sewer.

Some people say the act represents Bev's power and the uniting of the friends or some bs, but be real. What was that? Really. What did I read?

**Mike** (*IT's* savior)

If you have read *IT,* you probably noticed I have left Mike out. This is because I separate Mike from *IT.* He doesn't belong with the rest of the cast. Don't judge Mike. 

Mike is actually a great character with an interesting backstory focused around his father, and being black. In fact, all things related to Mike in *IT* were actually done well. I even like Mike's father, Will. Will is just a cool dude who stands up for himself only when the situation calls for it. 

Following the character motif, Mike is black (seen as lesser than others), *but* he's strong and smart. Mike has to deal with incessant racism from Henry and occasionally experiences it from others. Mike doesn't cry when this happens. Mike fights back. Mike is fast and strong and uses it to his advantage. Through Mike we learn about Derry, and realize that Mike never ran from Derry. Mike stayed in Derry and kept the fear right beside him. In the end, Mike fights Henry one-on-on and fatally wounds him. 

Mike's journal conveys powerful emotion and I feel deeply for Mike when he writes about losing his father. When King writes about Will's cancer, I have never seen death expressed much better. Mike isn't scared about monsters like the other kids. Mike is scared of his dad dying. 

""As time went on, it got so I could hardly think of things to talk about with him anymore. Riding into town, I'd rack my brain for subjects of conversation, dreading the moment when both of us would run out of things to say. His dying scared me and enraged me, but it embarrassed me, too... the cancer was doing more than killing him. It was degrading him, demeaning him."" 

Mike is a rich character and stood out head and shoulders above the rest. The difference between the other members of the Loser's Club and Mike is that, Mike was deemed a loser and part of the Loser's Club because he was black. He was not a loser in his mind. Ben was just a fat loser.

**IT**

IT is a spider, but not really. IT is a spider, but not really because it's an intergalactic omnipotent being that has possibly been alive for all of the universe's creation. Oh, the universe was created by a turtle. So god is a turtle. The turtle dies by choking on a galaxy, or two. 

I promise I'm not making this up.

Anyways, IT can transform into anything, but chooses to be a bird, Frankenstein's monster, an eye, and some other 'meh' scary beings. IT is basically one of the most powerful beings you have ever read about, but IT couldn't handle killing 7 kids. 

Do yourself a favor and just ignore all the lore behind IT, and the book becomes slightly better. Basically, IT is a spooky monster that kills kids. The kids kill IT though. Well, the kids come back as adults and kill IT. But not really? IT is still alive, possibly. 

**Conclusion**

*IT* is a 1473 page novel that is 600 pages too long. If there is a horror aspect of the novel, it gets lost in translation. The protagonists are weak and annoying. The antagonist is an alien monster that is stopped by the power of friendship and imagination. There are no twists. The writing is mind-mumblingly boring, and extremely cheesy.

1qnnau,Lost in The Funhouse by Barth and why I think it has three authors.,"If you haven't read it, I suggest you do. It's a 20 page or so story that you could probably find as a PDF on Google.

For those of you that have read it, I have a theory for explaining Lost in the Funhouse and I've seen my share of lectures and blogposts trying to see if I could find the same theory but not to any success. 

In the earlier versions of Funhouse, there are many mistakes with punctuation and the spelling of words. In newer versions, some have been fixed (if not all). 

My theory is that these mistakes are not actually accidental mistakes, but they are deliberate mistakes. There is one mistake in particular that caught my eye and it went something along the lines of this:

**(Text text text text text text text parenthesis**

The mistake here is that instead of using an actual parenthesis, the author writes it out. So now, the theory begins to come into place here. 

**There are three authors to Lost in the Funhouse**

The first author is Barth, the guy who actually wrote it and the second is Ambrose (main character). A mistake such as what I mentioned earlier would be extremely hard to miss, especially after a publishing company looks at it. So, it's somewhat easy to say that whomever wrote it down within the story made that mistake. Let us remember that Ambrose was going crazy at the end and was stuck in the funhouse. If he was beginning to go crazy, then it's not entirely impossible that the entire Lost in the Funhouse story was written by Barth but orated by Ambrose as he was stuck in the Funhouse, explaining further why he was stumbling about with how the form of the story should be written. It was told that Ambrose was dead by the end,so then how was he able to write it? How could he have written it if he died?

It's simple. 

**Ambrose orated the entire story, thinking of a way to write the story of his adventure in the Funhouse and how he got out but the bad thing is that he never gets out. Meanwhile, the third author of the story is the person who wrote down everything Ambrose said: One of the Funhouse workers. Why they did not save Ambrose, I don't know. However, it explains the paradox of how Ambrose made it back home and died at the same time - because it's definitely not symbolism we're looking at here. In the story which Ambrose orates, he ends it with how he manages to get out and go home but the worker later finds out he died, feels compelled to write the story and adds in the ending of him dying.**

Again, just to make myself clear. It's entirely possible the worker was not very bright which is why they wrote out the word instead of the symbol (Parenthesis).

So, from my theory, this short story (or what have you) is a story that involves the dilemma of how to write a story in which the dying fictional author struggles with how to write a story which is then transcribed by another separate entity who struggles with how to physically write the story.

Basil - Painter, paints Dorian ‘cause he’s totally hot.
Harry - Insufferable twat and totally gay for Dorian.  

Basil paints Dorian.  Harry tells Dorian how hot he is and that when he loses his looks, he’ll lose everything.  Basil finishes painting.  Dorian realizes how hot he really is and prays that the painting will age instead of him.

Fast forward 4 chapters.

Dorian falls in love with an actress, Sibyl, and takes Basil and Harry out to her show.  When she falls in love with Dorian she stops caring about acting and puts on a terrible show.  Dorian no longer loves her because she’s a terrible actress.  Being the young teen that Sibyl is, she feels crushed, like she could die.  So she kills herself.  Dorian is upset, but he gets over it.  Quickly.  Dorian then learns that his sins appear on the portrait and not on himself.  He doesn’t age.  So naturally he uses this new found ability wreak havoc and entertain acts of serious debauchery and villainy.  First he studies music.  (The horror!)  Then he studies stone: gems, ruby’s pearls.  (The agony!)  Then he studies tapestries.  (The unadulterated fiendish perversion!)

Fastforward a few more chapters.

Dorian is now 38.  He apparently had sex with a few women and ruined their reputation.  I’m not positive.  The book didn’t really talk about it much.  For every word about his sex life there are about 4 pages of descriptions of tapestries that he adores.  Basil comes to talk to him about the rumors going around town of his second life.  So Dorian shows Basil the changed painting and then kills him.  He then blackmails an old friend into disposing of the body for him.  The old friend does, and then promptly kills himself.  With all this death, Dorian decides to clear his mind with opium to forget about all of this unpleasantness.  On his way he sees a sailor.  The sailor turns out to be the brother of Sibyl, the woman who killed herself because Dorian doesn’t love her and he has sworn to kill Dorian.  Exciting!  The sailor is then accidentally shot and killed on a hunting trip and then forgotten.  Almost exciting…  Dorian realizes the error of his ways and decides to turn his life around.  Life lessons!!!  He decides to be nice to a woman by making her fall madly in love with him and then dumping her… Well, at least he didn’t fuck her.  Yea.  I guess there’s that.  Harry tells him that was a dick move bro.  Seriously.  Might as well just fucked her at least.  Now Dorian doesn’t know what to do.  His life is a mess because painting exists and the world around him has encouraged him to be an awful person.  It’s the world’s fault for being so… damn… impartial!  In NO way was any of this Dorian’s fault.  But for some unknown reason it still seems to bother him.  All of this death and villainy and tapestries.  So he decides to confess everything he’s done.  But first he has to destroy the painting.  If he’s going to look mad in front of everyone the last thing he needs is evidence…  So he stabs the painting with a knife.  Then the servants find him dead on the floor stabbed in the chest.

End



Then I promptly threw the book across the room because it took Oscar Wilde 230 pages to write a 2 page story...  In short, this entire book is an annotation of the story that should have been written.  No Oscar, don't tell us about the debauchery or anything that happens, please, tells us more about the tapestries.

bf1ble,"This time I finished ""Red Seas under Red Skies"" (Book #2 in the Gentleman Bastard series) and it was .. very good.","Disclaimer 1 – **SPOILER ALERT**  
Disclaimer 2 – I had no frame of reference for comparison in the previous book. This time I do. And I intend to make full use of the privilege. There will be multiple references to “The Lies of Locke Lamora”, hereby abbreviated TLoLL.

Disclaimer 3 - This iis a review, but it's also my thoughts on the book. The fact that it doesn't seem personable or conversational - I hope that's fine?

I started this as soon as I was done with book #1 in the Gentleman Bastard series and that’s saying something about how captivated the first book’s world building left me that I didn’t want to get out of it. This, the 2nd book in the series was very good as well. Did I like it as Much as I did Book 1? No. But it still stood well on its own. Feels familiar to how Well of Ascension was in comparison to The Final Empire (Mistborn #2 and #1 respectively.)  
If TLoLL had us following Locke Lamora and Jean Tannen solely on land, this time their time was distributed between both land and sea. The book opens to a present-scene of confrontation and double-crossing (Scott Lynch wastes no time) and then we’re taken to a time when their previous story ended and this one began – aboard a ship sailing for Tal Verrar from Camorr. As in TLoLL, here as well, we have multiple timelines being narrated – a timeline of preparation for their activities and setting the stage for the “play” they mean to enact around unsuspecting characters and another timeline 2 years hence where the trickery is afoot. The main antagonists, so to speak, are Requin & Selendri and Maxilan Stragos and Merrain.  
Initially all Locke and Jean wanted to do was hoodwink Requin at the Sinspire and escape, but they find themselves unwillingly at the mercy of Stragos after the latter poisons them and enlists them as his contractors, giving them the task of stirring up trouble from the seas and bringing back piracy to Tal Verrar, so that he, Stragos could defeat them using his navy and seem victorious in the eyes of the city, so as to seem in control as opposed to his current shunted standing. This puts quite the dent in Locke and Jean’s plans, so they have to improvise their plans to factor this new development and Locke decides to do what he does best – pretend to be a double agent, trying to gain the favors of Requin to beat Stragos, who the Master of the Sinspire does not like either.   
Following this brief bit of initial setup on land, the duo are sent to sea to pretend Captain and First Mate of a ship called The Red Messenger, assisted and directed behind the scenes by an actual seamaster, Caldris. Unfortunately Caldris dies while they are at sea and they are found out by the crew and mutinied.   
This is the first of admittedly very few hints of convenience I felt Scott Lynch exploited as he introduced Captain Drakasha and her ship, the very people who the Archon needed as pawns for his plan, into the mix, with no real struggle on Locke and Jean’s part except a few hours of sailing on a boat.   
Aside from that and a couple other mild issues, I felt the overall plot was well done and tied together. The finesse of TLoLL was missing as was a lot of the banter and Father Chains, Calo, Galdo and Bug were missed. There was also a gaping hole in the non-usage of an “ally” they picked up as they were training for their tower-jumping escapade at The Sinspire. But I’m sure **that** was a calculated move.

Locke had set himself up to be the primary antihero in TLoLL. Here we see Locke a lot in the background as compared to Jean. Then again, this can be argued to be a plot feature illustrating Locke’s mood and possible post-trauma effects inflicted upon him because of his losses and his wounds. To that end, the romance between Jean and Ezri Delmastro and the focus on their relationship was a pleasant introduction and read; not at all overly mushy as these scenes tend to be. What I also liked was how Scott gave the series a strong female character in Drakasha. I loved the chapters where was in focus and her way of balancing a ship as well as her role as a mother. The touch of insistence that a cat and a woman **were** necessary for a smooth sailing and several minute details were also very welcome.

One thing I noticed particularly was how we see Stragos’ mind at work in one of the chapters – his perspective was given importance. We’ve been used to seeing only the protagonists’ perspectives thus far. This also set the tone for Merrain as a far more important player than she portrayed herself to be, which was evident when she escaped despite Jean and Locke’s efforts and plans.   
Another thing that I loved was the consistency in the relationship between Jean and Locke; they remained thick as …well..thieves throughout, even with that one minor argument they had that they bounced back from relatively quickly, ego suppressed and all that. Well done. And Locke’s act in the final scene was lovely. Sealed the deal and all that.

I won’t tell you how the book ends for two reasons – If you’ve read it, you already know. And if you haven’t, I’d rather you discover this bit for yourself. I can’t rob you of that pleasure even if you did sign up for the spoilers.

I’m definitely looking forward to reading The Republic of Thieves for 3 reasons – The Bondsmagi of Karthain, Sabetha’s arc and to see if Locke escapes the clutches of death again.

PS – Learnt a lot about ships and nautical terms in this book. Good, that.

4d4c4x,"Has anyone read 1974 Non-Fiction Pulitzer Prize winner ""Denial of Death"" by Ernst Becker? It seems to me like an odd, dated, sometimes backward but valuable gem about human's psychological quest for immortality. I just finished and have attached a review.","If you can handle the numerous historical idiosyncrasies, the strange ""science"" of psychoanalysis, and myriad other oddities in this book, you get a fascinating discussion of what death means to man and how it may affect our behaviors in this Pulitzer Prize winner from the 1970s.

Ernst Becker suggests:

1. Humans are deeply afraid of death, and we subconsciously devote ourselves to an ""immortality project"" in order for us to live for eternity (at least symbolically) after we physically die. This can come via a commitment to a religion or a nation state that will provide a vehicle for meaningful immortality, or in the form of creative output that contributes something unique and everlastingly valuable to the universe (e.g. art, science, music or philosophical thought), or via transference to some seemingly god-like person that gives life meaning and gives us a sense of power (which could be a charismatic leader like Donald Trump or even simply a romantic life partner that validates our importance and value in the universe). There are many different paths, but we need to find some comfort that we will live on after our deaths, and much of human activity (at least activity not associated with meeting our basic needs) is driven by the motivation to resolve this tension of mortality.

2. Life is largely a balance between biting off too big of a chunk of the world (mania, schizophrenia) and biting off too little of a chunk of the world (depression, OCD, fetishes). This is a simplification of course and an injustice to our current biological knowledge of these diseases. However, this balance is still a useful way to think about life.

3. Psychotherapy does not provide enough of a cosmic context or enough of a heroic mythical story. What is done in therapy sessions insufficiently connects people to a greater meaning, one that will help them feel their actions will empower them to live on after their death. Pure science or psychology can never quite fulfill the human need to be part of a greater heroic story that can provide meaning and purpose. We have to make up this cosmic story (consciously or subconsciously) and have enough faith that it matters in the big scheme of things to be able to function optimally in the world.

4. Part of growing up and maturing is coming to terms with your limitations as a human being (e.g. death, the fact that you did not create yourself, you inability to change everything in the world, and your inability to have everything go your way). This must happen for all children; they all have to go through the pain of learning these unfortunate lessons that remind them that the universe does not forever bend to their desires. Child-rearing will always have tension because of this fact: children must learn that they cannot have it all or forever be master of the universe.

5. Thus, with all of this taken together, the goal of maturing is to live in a way so as to still be expansive and creative but (i) without being manic -- and eventually disappointed -- by taking on too much in the world and taking on too many goals you will never be able to fully control and (ii) to do so also while not retreating into too small of a ""safe space"" of action and efficacy (such as obsessively focusing on a few small things in your life -- like obsessively organizing your house -- that you can control) that limits your capacity as a larger actor in the universe and sells you short on your potential. 

6. He suggests mental illness can be defined by when your navigation of this balance becomes a burden upon others (which of course most people today would have very mixed feelings about suggesting), such as when your manic demands become too great or when you are depressed and are not contributing to the world or others' satisfaction in life. The tension of mortality and our unique place in the world starts to matter most when our actions and reactions to these questions start to affect other people.

How can these themes be applied to real life? Ernst Becker does not really try to answer this question. Indeed, the solutions are not entirely satisfying (after all, they can never be, since we can never solve the problem of death) or new, but one might suggest something like the following by extrapolating from his thoughts:

Make sure your work and your actions are connected to a mature story of cosmic heroism in the universe. This could be via devoting yourself to God or to improving humanity. Then strive to do what you can in life while accepting your limitations and your inability to control everything. Intermittently monitor your activities to see if you are stretching yourself too far and demanding too much of the world, or if you are not being as active, creative and expansive as you could be. Try to live more functionally and meaningfully by connecting what you do each day to a higher cosmic story, even if it scares you that there is no inherent justification that your story is right or that your great myth matters in the universe. Be open to the fact that your cosmic story may be wrong, and always be willing to alter your cosmic story and your ""immortality project"" to new evidence or input from the world.

We have to do the best we can, not deny our deaths, and live bravely, all while ultimately knowing that even our symbols must some day die. We have to a functional faith (even atheists) that it all matters in the end, that there is meaning to be found, and alas, that the end is not really the end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4d4c4x/has_anyone_read_1974_nonfiction_pulitzer_prize/,2016-04-03T01:37:31Z,2,24,books,It Ends with Us,POST
37wau2,"Just read the ENTIRE 10 book Stephen R. Donaldson ""Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever"" series, from beginning to end. And it was amazing and terrible at the same time. Am I crazy?","Well, I took close to a year and read the entire Thomas Covenant fantasy series from beginning to end. 

I had started this series as a kid 20 years ago and read the first 6 books at least twice, and for years whenever someone asked about a good fantasy series I brought it up as something which I felt had never received its due. So a couple of years ago a successful screenwriter friend asked if there were any great fantasy series I knew of that had not been turned into films yet. His agent checked and the rights were available, so on my recommendation he started book 1, ""Lord Fouls Bane."" Within a month he came back and said he couldn't finish the first book because, ""Nothing happens.""  

I was a bit horrified and chalked it up to a Hollywood guy who didn't understand great story, but it also shook me a little. If one of my polestars as a kid was not evidently great, then perhaps my entire history of reading might be called into question. Yes, dramatic, but its the same way I felt for years because I listened to New Wave as a kid and NOT Punk, so I felt my music history was not as ""legit."" So I decided to go back and read them all again, including the last 4 books which had come out over the past few years. 

In some ways, it was a great as I remember. I still felt it challenged long-held traditions of Fantasy, especially with a strong anti-hero. I also felt ""The Land"" was an incredible creative invention on Donaldson's part.  It was magical but internally coherent, had a deep history and lore, and was so huge in scale that you felt there must be a profound intellect at work. The View of the story arc, the characters, the underlying cultural and social cues were so well formed, it could only come from an author firing on all cylinders. It was familiar enough to be comfortable and relatable, but different enough to be continually engaging.  

But as an adult reading these books, (it really pains me to critique these books) I began to feel a disconnect between the grand View of the story arc and any emotional connection with the characters, particularly as the books progressed.  To be fair, in the beginning books, the emotional landscapes of the characters conveyed weight and depth.  But it felt that as the novels progressed, the characters moved further and further away from being real individuals with real emotions but instead moved closer to plot devices needed to carry us to the final inevitable resolution. 

The last 4 books, the most recent ones written decades after the first 6, then started so well. It seemed like Donaldson had really taken in what I assume were years of criticism as well as his own emotional journey, and had played them out in a new and refreshing way. It was so exciting to experience brief glimpses of what I had always thought the books could hold. But after settling into the story, it once again started to bog down and there were pages of emotional plot hammering again. At one point in book 9 I told my wife I felt trapped in whirlpool which I couldn't escape from. And in the end, I finished feeling a little empty, a little more confused and completely drained.  

And the strangest part of all? I still love them. I will never read them again, I know that. Am I suffering from battered spouse syndrome brought on by my reading as a kid? Maybe, I don't know. But there is still a part of me that is so glad I finished them.  

But that is hwy I am writing. My connection to these books is too close for me to understand whether my experience is even close what others had.  
So I am curious, what did you think?

656tsy,"I interviewed author Ann Patchett for a newspaper article in 2009 and just found the transcript. I thought r/books might find it interesting, so here it is!","In another life as a journalist I had the opportunity to interview several interesting people in the arts world, including a number of authors. This interview was conducted in April of 2009, not long after I graduated college. I'm sure this was condensed at the time, so it's probably not 100 percent complete. Apologies for any holes in the conversation.

Q: WHAT LED YOU TO WANT TO BECOME A WRITER?

A: “It’s one of those things, I’ve never done anything else. From the time I was a little tiny kid, this is all I’ve ever wanted to do. And I can’t put my finger on it, but if you had asked me when I was 5 years old I would have told you I wanted to be a writer.”

Q: DID YOU STUDY WRITING AS AN UNDERGRAD?

A: “I did. I studied writing in college and it was much more important to me than Iowa. My writing education really came from Sarah Lawrence. I took a year of poetry but mostly it was fiction, it was short stories. But I studied with Al Gurganis and Grace Paley and Russell Banks, so I had a pretty brilliant undergraduate education in creative writing.”

Q: DO YOU STILL AGREE THAT SHORT STORIES NEED A SCANDAL? (I think this question was based on something she wrote about short stories in an intro to a collection or something, but no longer remember...)

A: “I’m feeling really good about the short story right now, and I think it has to do with the fact that since I edited that, I got involved with a couple of the writers in that book ... I feel like all of a sudden I’m surrounded by short story writers doing well, and it makes me feel a little better about the state of the short story, but it might just be from my own limited perspective. I do get the feeling that publishers, for whatever reason right now, are being a little kinder about publishing books of short stories.”

Q: DOES BEING SURROUNDED BY SHORT STORY WRITERS MAKE YOU WANT TO PUT TOGETHER A COLLECTION OF YOUR OWN?

A: “Well I’d have to write some first, so no. I actually don’t write short stories. I’m judging three short story contests right now, which is wild…” 

Q: WHY DO YOU GRAVITATE TOWARD THE THEME OF STRANGERS BEING THROWN TOGETHER? IS IT CONSCIOUS OR DOES IT JUST HAPPEN?

A: “It think it just kind of happens. I also think if you said I’m gonna look at all of Western literature through the lens of strangers are thrown together and form some kind of family, it would probably be 60, 70 percent of all the books that are out there. It is a very, very broad, all-encompassing theme. If it turns out that’s the one way I can break down all my books and find a common thread, I don’t think that I’m in danger of repeating myself too much.”

Q: DO YOU HESITATE TO LABEL YOUR OWN WORK?

A: “No. No, I don’t hesitate. It kinda doesn’t matter one way or the other…”

SHE HAS A POLICY THAT SHE DOESN’T READ ANY INTERVIEWS THAT SHE GIVES, BECAUSE “it just makes me nuts and there’s nothing you can do about it. So I just sorta talk and forget about it and go on.” 

Q: YOUR BOOKS INCLUDE A WIDE VARIETY OF CHARACTERS, PLACES AND OCCUPATIONS. HOW MUCH RESEARCH GOES INTO YOUR WORK?

A: “More and more I research. The older I get the more research I do, and sometimes I think that research is just a magnificent stall, because it’s what you do when you’re not wanting to buckle down and actually do the work of writing. You just do a whole lot of research. And I really enjoy doing research because it’s how I learn about things. And I got to read all sorts of books about Boston politics and political speeches and South America and opera. It’s great. I’m writing a book now that has a lot to with malarial vaccines and so I’ve been reading a lot about malaria and it’s really interesting. But it is one of those things where you can sit down to write in the morning and then think, wait a minute I think I need to read one more book about malaria. And then you get up from the desk and you don’t really get anything done.”

Q: ARE THOSE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO RESEARCH THINGS YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT, THEN PUT IN THE BOOK, OR DOES IT HAPPEN ORGANICALLY? (Reading this back now this question seems confusing, I know...)

A: “Yeah, it’s more that (organic). I mean, it’s like I’m putting a plot together. I don’t shoehorn something in just because I’m interested in learning about it, it’s something naturally comes up in the plot that I don’t know anything about. I mean I don’t want to limit myself to things that I know about because that would be darn limiting. So I put it together and then figure out what I need to do my research on.”

Q: MANY OF YOUR CHARACTERS ARE MEN; ONE MAIN CHARACTER IS BLACK. IS IT DIFFICULT TO WRITE FROM THOSE OTHER PERSPECTIVES?

A: “Actually I think that if you write about somebody who is in your own situation then the idea of writing books full of 45-year-old women would be pretty rough. But if you’re writing about somebody who’s not you but has a lot in common with you, I think that it actually can make one lazy because you don’t think about it enough. You think, oh well I know this. But if you write about people who are farther away from you in their experiences, gender, socioeconomic class, you’re more likely, I am more likely, to actually buckle down and think about it harder. So I think strangely enough it’s easier to get a character who is closer to you wrong.”

Q: IS IT EVER A STRUGGLE TO IDENTIFY WITH THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO DIFFERENT?

A: “I think that sometimes some things are harder than others. For example, I found the young terrorists in 'Bel Canto' harder because those are people I have never seen. Those are people I have not bumped up against at all. So I think that was probably my biggest stretch for a group of characters.”

Q: YOU'VE ALSO WRITTEN TWO BOOKS OF NONFICTION. HOW IS WRITING NONFICTION DIFFERENT FROM WRITING FICTION? IS IT MORE DIFFICULT THAN CREATING FROM SCRATCH?

A: “No, actually it’s much, much easier. I write a lot of essays, I do magazine work. I actually really enjoy writing nonfiction because I feel like the burden of coming up with everything isn’t on me. And usually also the piece presents itself with a certain amount of shape. If you’re writing about a trip, you know where it starts, you know where it ends. If you’re writing about an event you have your characters already, you have your setting. I really enjoy nonfiction.”

ON GIVING THE COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT A LOCAL COLLEGE A COUPLE YEARS BEFORE: 

“I’ve been there twice because they invited me up to do convocation and the incoming freshman class read 'Bel Canto,' and then when that class graduated four years later they invited me back to give the commencement address. It was a really sweet little program. They do that every year and then four years later they bring the author back.”

Q: WHAT WILL YOU SPEAK ABOUT AT THE (UPCOMING LOCAL FESTIVAL AT THE TIME)? WILL YOU BE READING FROM “RUN”?

Q: “I’ll have to talk to them, but it is my experience that people at these festivals usually don’t want you to read. They usually want you to give a talk kind of about writing and process and that sort of thing. And then somebody’ll say, yeah, we want you to read, in which case I would probably read from 'Run,' but I’ll have to find out what they want. If you know, let me know.”

Q: REGARDING THE SHORT STORY QUOTE WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, ARE THERE SIMILAR ISSUES NOW IN ANY GENRE THAT YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING SIMILAR ABOUT THAT YOU THINK HASN’T GOTTEN ITS DUE?

A: “I always think the short story hasn’t gotten its due. There’s just a big debate right now as to whether or not literature is getting its due. Books. I think that that would probably be the thing right now. You know, are we all gonna go the way of the Kindle, the electronic book, are people not reading anymore, is publishing dying. People talk about this constantly and I tend to be pretty Pollyanna-ish about the whole thing and say yes, people are still reading. But of course wherever I go giant crowds of people turn out because they’re interested in reading. So I feel like I go all over the country talking about books, talking about reading and writing, and there are always so many people who are really interested in reading and writing. So I, from my perspective, don’t see that literature is dying out, but certainly a lot of people tell me that these are dire times. And it’s so strange to me that people will sit around and say boy, you know, I sure don’t want my local independent bookstore to fade away, and then they’ll get a Kindle and download electronic books from Amazon. So it’s a really easy thing, I think. If people care about books and they care about reading, they need to buy books. Not necessarily mine, but they need to buy books. You know there are all of these industries that are getting economic bailouts; publishing is not gonna be one of them. I feel like, wow, I should go out and buy a Ford and help the auto industry. I don’t need a Ford. But you know, 20 bucks, 15 bucks, you can go out and buy a book. And I think it is a really great opportunity for not a lot of money to support something that a lot of us feel is very important. We wanna keep this alive, we wanna keep books going, we wanna keep little bookstores going. So it’s not rocket science. Go to your little bookstore and buy a book.”

Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK IS SO IMPORTANT ABOUT KEEPING THESE BOOKS AND BOOKSTORES ALIVE? WHAT IS IT ABOUT BOOKS AND READING THAT MAKES THEM SO IMPORTANT?

A: “I think it’s a matter of having inner resources. That if you have a book you’re always gonna be okay. You’re always going to be able to entertain yourself, to take care of yourself, you’re not gonna be bored, you’re not gonna be lonely. You’re going to have a porthole into another world. You get to use your imagination. It’s a stimulating exercise for the brain, and I think that we really need that. And I think it’s also a stimulating exercise in empathy, because when you read, especially fiction, it helps you imagine what other people’s lives are like, and I think that it makes us more compassionate people.”

Q: IS THIS WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR OWN WRITING? IS THERE A MESSAGE THAT YOU TRY TO GET ACROSS WITH YOUR WORKS?

A: “You know, when I write a book, I write the book that I want to read. I write the book that isn’t out there that I want to read, and I write it for myself. I don’t think about other people reading it, I don’t think about getting a message across. I don’t ever think about people reading my books. It’s just like there’s something missing on my bookshelf, there’s a story that I really want somebody to tell me and so I tell it to myself. It’s kinda strange.”

Q: WHAT DO YOU KNOW NOW THAT YOU WISH YOU HAD KNOWN WHEN STARTING OUT AS A WRITER? IS IT EASIER NOW?

A: “I don’t wish that I had known anything else when I was starting out because I think if I had I might’ve made some different decisions. I mean there are so many elements of this job that have nothing to do with writing, the job element of it. This – I never knew about this. I never knew when I was in graduate school…”

3algfs,Re-read an old favorite: H.M.S. Ulysses by Alistair Maclean - I honestly think it might be one of the best novels I've ever read.,"**TL;DR:** **It's kind of like *Moby Dick* mixed *The Cruel Sea* with tones and themes similar to *Platoon*. Where *Moby Dick* focuses on the themes of obsession and revenge, *Ulysses* focuses on courage: the need for it, what it really is, and what it takes to find it.** 

For those of you who might not be familiar, Alistair Maclean was a somewhat famous novelist of the 1950s and 1960s who wrote a number of action/war novels that were turned into classic movies like *Where Eagles Dare*, *The Guns of Navarone*, and *Ice Station Zebra*. 

*H.M.S. Ulysses* was his debut novel and is considered by some to be his finest work. I intend to lay out a brief case as to why I consider this to be a truly gifted and under-appreciated work. 

The core of the novel is directly drawn from Maclean's experiences serving on a *Dido*-class light cruiser on the Arctic Convoys to Murmansk of World War 2. Ulysses is a ship desperately in need of a break. Escorting back to back to back convoys in subzero conditions, where the enemy can attack in force at any time has pushed the crew to the brink of mental and physical collapse. But before the ship can win a respite in the sunny Mediterranean, it must make one last run. 

Now what is it you ask that makes this novel special?

1. *The pacing and structure are near-perfect.* The plot of *Ulysses* is as lean and efficient as the ship in the center of the story. His opening chapter with the ship's officers having to explain the crew's borderline mutinous state effectively sets the tone and atmosphere of both the WW2-era Royal Navy and a fighting boat held together only by frayed discipline. Though the story only covers roughly a week, the rising and falling action spikes up and down like rolling seas - effectively imparting the unpredictable and near-suicidal nature of their mission. This is well balanced as well by brief windows of cold comfort and a few precious moments where both characters and readers are left in awe by what could best be described as the Battle of the Atlantic on Legendary mode. It's actually somewhat stunning how dense a plot Maclean fits into 450-odd pages while maintaining the pace that he does. Despite the density of detail, it's highly readable and ruthlessly avoids Dickensian rambles of unnecessary exposition. 

2. *Maclean's use of tension and conflict defines the story*. Almost every war story has the conflict of man vs. enemy, and almost every sailor story has man vs. nature and/or the crew vs. the powers that be. Maclean's masterstroke is to reframe all those conflicts within the immortal one of man vs. himself. Each character on board the *Ulysses* is faced by near-impossible tests of their physical and mental endurance from all sides. The question Maclean asks is - what is it that allows people to endure the impossible, grapple with the unknowable, or face down the inevitable? For some it's an almost saintly love, for others it's nihilistic hate, and many are mercilessly crushed by their unequal tasks while some have moments of unlikely, even unbelievable heroism.

3. *The story is written by a veteran, for veterans and it shows.* From the very first chapter, Maclean's characters insist that one can't truly understand what it was like on the Murmansk run unless you've actually been there. And the novel eloquently proves that point. Maclean doesn't pull any punches as he describes the grim fate of anyone unfortunate enough to be on a torpedoed ship in the Arctic, where even the sailors that make it onto a lifeboat are found months later having frozen to death on the first night. Or as he describes both ships and men ruthlessly sacrificed to save the rest. Equally vivid are the descriptions of life aboard a cruiser on the Arctic convoys: cold and wet, where sleep and normal meals are a struggle and the omnipresent fear all sailors have of being trapped below decks on a doomed ship. The Germans in this story are not Indiana Jones style - wacky Nazis, but a dangerous and skilled, yet elusive and often unseen enemy with whom a perverse mutual respect and camaraderie is formed. 

4. *The story has a relatively unique take on war, effectively balancing both the cynical and the romantic views.* The story in many ways is one almost outside of time, and therefore out of touch with both the attitude of the time it was written, and today. It was too dark, gritty, and anti-authority for the jingoistic attitudes of the 50s (which is probably why it was never adapted into film like Maclean's other work), and is too stiff-upper-lip and old-school masculine to be a product of the attitudes of today. Curious as well are the moral decisions made by the characters, with the captain both choosing to break Admiralty orders and have survivors picked up, and also deliberately driving the ship over men in the water as an impulsive act of mercy. The war itself and the strategic decisions that lead the *Ulysses* to their circumstances are treated like forces of nature, not to be futilely challenged or questioned, just stoically accepted and met with best efforts because that's what men of honor do. The characters often jag between bitter sarcasm and heartfelt sentiment in a sometimes bewildering, but ironically congruent fashion.

5. *The book offers many great thoughts on leadership, morale, and authority.* The officers and crew of the *Ulysses* play a tenuous dance. Both are at the end of their tether, both are terribly anxious of making the dreaded mistake that gets people killed, and both suffer under the seemingly insane demands of their superiors. Captain Vallery is painted as an almost Christ-like figure, selflessly and inexorably destroying what remains of his failing health to see his ship through one last mission. The savvy Surgeon-Commander Brooks attempts to keep both the precarious morale and crippled health of the crew intact for one more day. And the kindly but competent Admiral Tyndall struggles with an endless series of damned-if-do-damned-if-you-don't decisions. Maclean views the chain of command and authority as easily misused but necessary evils (to keep men in line under fire) but in truth an oppressive burden requiring the best within us to shoulder the responsibility of command. At the end of the day, somebody has to make the impossible choices. 

So how best to sum it up? It's kind of like *Moby Dick* mixed *The Cruel Sea* with tones and themes similar to *Platoon*. Where *Moby Dick* focuses on the themes of obsession and revenge, *Ulysses* focuses on courage: the need for it, what it really is, and what it takes to find it. 

Which perfectly explains and matches the epigraph of the novel - an excerpt of Tennyson's *Ulysses*:

>Come, my friends,

> 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.

> Push off, and sitting well in order smite

> The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds

> To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths

> Of all the western stars, until I die.

> It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:

> It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,

> And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

> Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'

> We are not now that strength which in old days

> Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;

> One equal temper of heroic hearts,

> Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

> To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

2oii7o,"What was Joseph Heller getting at in Catch-22 with all that talk of ""flies in his eyes""? Orr makes that claim about Appleby, and I don't get it.","Near the beginning of the novel, right after Doc Daneeka's infamous explanation of the logic of Catch-22, the narration veers toward an aside about something Orr said to Yossarian. For those who need a reminder (big spoiler) [Orr is the soldier who acts like an senseless smalltown idiot throughout the novel, including crashing his plane into the sea 17 times, but surprises us and Yossarian at the end when it's revealed that instead of dying in a plane crash as was believed, Orr had excecuting a brilliant escape to Sweden where he'd live out the war in safety while the US military presumed him dead.](/spoiler)

Here's the passage in question, as Yossarian tries to convince the Doc to deem him insane and unfit for duty. It feels like an important idea and is situated just after the Catch itself, but I haven't the foggiest notion of what it's supposed to add up to, if anything. Thoughts?

**From Catch-22:**
   
""'*You mean there's a catch*?'    
 
   '*Sure there's a catch*,' Doc Daneeka replied. '*Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy*.' There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute 
    simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.
    
 '*That's some catch, that Catch-22*,' he observed.
    
   '*It's the best there is*,' Doc Daneeka agreed.
    
   Yossarian saw it clearly in all its spinning reasonableness. There was an elliptical precision about its perfect pairs of parts that was graceful and shocking, like good modern art, and at times Yossarian wasn't quite sure that he saw it at all, just the way he was never quite sure about good modern art or about the flies Orr saw in Appleby's eyes. He had Orr's word to take for the flies in Appleby's eyes.
    
   '*Oh, they're there, all right*,' Orr had assured him about the flies in Appleby's eyes after Yossarian's fist fight with Appleby in the officers' club, '*although he probably doesn't even know it. That's why he can't see things as they really are*.'
    
   '*How come he doesn't know it*?' inquired Yossarian.
    
   '*Because he's got flies in his eyes*,' Orr explained with exaggerated patience. '*How can he see he's got flies in his eyes if he's got flies in his eyes*?' It made as much sense as anything else, and Yossarian was willing to give Orr the benefit of the doubt because Orr was from the wilderness outside New York City and knew so much more about wildlife than Yossarian did, and because Orr, unlike Yossarian's mother, father, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, in-law, teacher, spiritual leader, legislator, neighbor and newspaper, had never lied to him about anything crucial before. Yossarian had mulled his newfound knowledge about Appleby over in private for a day or two and then decided, as a good deed, to pass the word along to Appleby himself.
    
   '*Appleby, you've got flies in your eyes*,' he whispered helpfully as they passed by each other in the doorway of the parachute tent on the day of the weekly milk run to Parma.
    
   '*What*?' Appleby responded sharply, thrown into confusion by the fact that Yossarian had spoken to him at all.
    
   '*You've got flies in your eyes*,' Yossarian repeated. '*That's probably why you can't see them*.' Appleby retreated from Yossarian with a look of loathing bewilderment and sulked in silence until he was in the jeep with Havermeyer riding down the long, straight road to the briefing room, where Major Danby, the fidgeting group operations officer, was waiting to conduct the preliminary briefing with all the lead pilots, bombardiers and navigators. Appleby spoke in a soft voice so that he would not be heard by the driver or by Captain Black, who was stretched out with his eyes closed in the front seat of the jeep.
    
   '*Havermeyer*,' he asked hesitantly. '*Have I got flies in my eyes*?' 
    
   Havermeyer blinked quizzically. '*Sties*?' he asked.
    
   '*No, flies*,' he was told.
    
   Havermeyer blinked again. '*Flies*?'
    
   '*In my eyes*.'
    
   '*You must be crazy*,' Havermeyer said.
    
   '*No, I'm not crazy. Yossarian's crazy. Just tell me if I've got flies in my eyes or not. Go ahead. I can take it.*' Havermeyer popped another piece of peanut brittle into his mouth and peered very closely into Appleby's eyes.
    
   '*I don't see any*,' he announced. Appleby heaved an immense sigh of relief. Havermeyer had tiny bits of peanut brittle adhering to his lips, chin and cheeks.
    
   '*You've got peanut brittle crumbs on your face*,' Appleby remarked to him.
    
   '*I'd rather have peanut brittle crumbs on my face than flies in my eyes*,' Havermeyer retorted.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2oii7o/what_was_joseph_heller_getting_at_in_catch22_with/,2014-12-07T02:12:47Z,4,24,books,It Ends with Us,POST
r7w4n,"Chicken Farmer by Joseph Raymond, Ch 1, Pt 1 ... I'll publish the whole fucking thing on Reddit if people want to read it","
Chapter 1

""The child is Father of the Man. ... The things which I have seen [as a child] I now can see no more. Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting. ... Heaven lies about us in our infancy! Shades of the prison-house begin to close upon the growing boy.”  William Wordsworth, Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood.

“Truly I say to you, unless you become like children, you shall not enter the kingdom of God. Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.”  Matthew, 18:3-4.

I am no longer a child.  Innocence empowers the child to commune with the divine.  With every step into adulthood, a veil closes over innocence.  My veil closed shut on September 22, 2003 in Anbar Province, Iraq.  An improvised explosive device (“IED”) blew up the Hummer in which I rode as gunner mangling my right leg and damaging the left.  The doctors amputated the right below the knee but were able to save the left.  Funny thing: my artificial right leg supplied by the United States Government gives me less trouble these days than the left one that was original issue from God. 
 
My squad mates in the Hummer, Sergeant Barnes and Corporal Kelly, didn’t come out of it quite as well.  Sergeant Barnes bled to death, stomach wound, guts a jumbled mess.  Corporal Kelly lost an arm and a leg.  Last time I saw him, he was learning how to wipe his ass with his left hand.  I thank God every time I wipe my ass.
When Captain Ahab lost his leg, he had Moby Dick to focus his venom upon.  Ahab had a mission, a jihad against the white whale.  I couldn’t rightfully get mad at the Iraqis.  We arrived as foreign invaders.  One was not surprised they shot back.  I reenlisted in the Army knowing full well it meant deployment to a war zone.  The circumstances of the occupation were asinine.  There was no plan.  We destroyed the Iraqi government, its military, its police force, and the civilian infrastructure.  The country descended into chaos entrenching us in the middle of a civil war.  But I’m not a blameless man.  I asked Uncle George to stamp my ticket to the Sunni Triangle free fire zone.  And I was a happy gunner popping away at any “hajji” that dared make a false move in my presence, until the second of the explosion.  No white whale.  Got no one to blame but myself.

I bought a small farm in rural Missouri with my military disability income and a loan from Mom.   Started raising chickens, lots of chickens.  20,000 chickens.  Once you get over the perfume wafting at you from the droppings left by 20,000 little shitting machines, it’s not a bad life.  Every six hours you walk through the sheds, remove the dead and dying birds, check the heat lamps, check the feed and water, shovel some bird poop.  Then you get the next 5 hours to yourself.  To pass the time I engaged in biological warfare with my nearest neighbor, the hog farmer.  We’d pile nasty rotting animal waste in the corners of our land closest to one another.  Mother nature’s whimsy of which way the wind blew on a given day determined the winner.  Unfortunately, the prevailing winds were west to east.  I was east of the hog farmer.  Only a discriminating nose can discern the aroma of pig from chicken shit when mixed in the morning breeze.

The pickings for ladies in rural Missouri must not have been all that grand as Mom capably rounded up a bevy of prospective brides from the surrounding area.  One leg, ankle deep in chicken poop, and women were actually interested in signing up for duty in my world.  Mom interviewed ‘em.  Those that passed muster she sent on over for me to kick the tires.  Upon mutual consent, I’d then get a test-drive after the tire kick.  Liked the test-drive part of this exercise.  Seeing how Mom enjoyed pimping for her son, I lacked the heart to tell her I had no intention of selecting a bride.  Twenty-three years of age already with enough shit, literally, on my plate.  Best to hunker down and lick my wounds before rolling the dice in the marital crap shoot game.  Might roll snake eyes and end up hitched to a crazy diva.  One could never tell and I knew less about women than I did chickens.
One summer afternoon about a year into the chicken-farming gig, I drove a few towns up the highway to visit my father’s grave.  He died when I was twelve.  Mom remarried but Dad walks with me to this day.  A grave up the hill from Dad’s was recently dug up to add a new body to the plot.  Rain the day before washed mud over his marker.   This is how the conversation went as I knelt at his grave.

	“How goes it Dad?  Got mud all over your marker.  Let me clean that off for you.”  

The conversation could be a trifle one-sided.  Now and again Dad chipped in his two-cents but he generally didn’t say much.  Perhaps his one-quarter Native American ancestry made him that way.

	“You want to know how I’m getting along?  Well, still shoveling the bird shit and test-driving bride wannabe’s.  It’s not bad duty Dad.  I’m content to just work this thing until the urge comes to do something else.”

bm18y8,The Bride Test,"Okay so since we've all been talking about it in other threads, I'd though I'd start one for those of us who've read it or want to read it.  There are no spoilers below if you haven't read it.

&#x200B;

So I just finished and I LOVED it!  I will say that right off the bat, it felt similar to Kiss Quotient, but for sure it was a different book and the characters really drew me in right away.  Once again, there is a  neurotypical character in the story, but this was for sure not Stella 2.0.  Esme was just so sweet and eager that I felt in love with her a bit myself!  Fans of The Kiss Quotient will be happy as Stella and Michael make a very sweet appearance, but they are only in the book briefly.

&#x200B;

I loved having a non western heroine and thought that aspect was a breath of fresh air.  I will admit that I struggled a bit with figuring out how to pronounce some of the Vietnamese names/words, but I really liked seeing a very different prospective from most of the contemporaries that I read.  Plus I thought this book portrayed the issue of a green card marriage in a very interesting light and didn't either trash it or romanticize it.  Really made me think about those who choose that path.

&#x200B;

Also make sure to read the author's note at the end!  I don't want to spoil why, but it really puts the book in a new context and I really enjoyed it overall.

jsdksa,What are your top 10 romance reads of the year? (Not including rereads),"Maybe it's too early for this kind of post because we still have a month and a half left of 2020. But, I'm really curious to see what has been the best books everyone has read this year.

So far I have read 191 books (my best reading year of my life so far!) and *most* of them are romance or at least feature romance heavily in the plot.

Feel free to count whole series as one or an author's entire catalogue if you discovered a new favorite author. Go over or under 10 if you want as well. This is the internet, land of the do-what-you-want! 

Here is my list (not necessarily in order):

1. You Deserve Each Other by Sarah Hogle

2. Beach Read by Emily Henry 

3. The Roommate by Rosie Danan

4. Get a Life, Chloe Brown & Take a Hint, Dani Brown by Talia Hibbert

5. The Kiss Quotient & The Bride Test by Helen Hoang

6. ACOTAR series by Sarah J. Maas (technically I read the first book years ago, but I reread it this year and finished the series so I'm still counting it!)

7. Corrupt by Penelope Douglas (the series as a whole was a bit of a let down but this first book was WOW)

8. Today Tonight Tomorrow by Rachel Lynn Soloman (YA contemporary)

9. Olivia Dade's entire catalogue (read them all in the last month!)

10. Kate Clayborn's entire catalogue (read them all in the last week!)

Bonus/Honorable Mentions:

1. If I Never Met You by Mhairi McFarlane - my first book by this author, there is a romance, but I think this is more fiction. This book single-handedly healed me of my heartbreak. It's the most cathartic book I have ever read.

2. The Piper's Son by Melina Marchetta - this book is young adult fiction more so about a young man dealing with grief and depression, but there is a lovely romance in it that made me swoon! Another beautiful book. 

3. Ninth House by Leigh Bardugo - this might be stretching it because the ""romance"" never came to fruition in this book, but I have HOPE for book 2 maybe. I have never shipped two people harder in my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/jsdksa/what_are_your_top_10_romance_reads_of_the_year/,2020-11-11T18:26:03Z,252,158,RomanceBooks,The Bride Test,POST

ybz6hp,"Historical romance with a female lead who, at the very least, is socially inept to the point of being awkward or actually more directly displaying traits of Autism Spectrum Disorder?","In the Ravenels, Cassandra, Helen, and Pandora somewhat touch on this. Helen, in my opinion, being the most socially awkward of the three, with Pandora leaning more into an ADHD sort of realm. 

But I recently finished The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie, and *oh my lord*. 

*That’s* what I want. I think it’s very clear that Ian’s “madness” is depicted as what we know as ASD. He cannot meet people in the eyes without expressly trying. He takes words 100% at face value and has trouble with innuendo and sarcasm. He doesn’t follow (or see the point of) small talk. He has a special interest. 

He’s also depicted as having an eidetic memory, able to play the piano from listening to a song (but cannot read sheet music), and able to fluently speak multiple languages. This “brainiac” depiction of ASD I can do without, but it doesn’t bother me either. 

Are there any historical romances with *female* leads who have some of Lord Ian’s traits? 

Autistic/Neurodivergent threads have pretty much all the same recommendations.

y7xmf4,The Kiss Quotient Series by Helen Hoang will always be my fave romance series.,"Helen Hoang's trio of books are just a classic for me now. The first two books (The Kiss Quotient and The Bride Test) were the right amount of light and fluffy and hot and spicy It is the perfect duo to start off if you want to start reading spice, but The Heart Principle.... THE F\*\*KING HEART PRINCIPLE! It is not as spicy at the first two but the lack of spice makes up for it in tissues, I would give it a 6 star rating if I could. HELEN HOANG IF YOU ARE READING THIS I NEED A F\*\*KING SEQUEL TO THE HEART PRINCIPLE! There is no way you are ending it like that!

uz5c2m,"Standalone or self-contained romance stories that involve an autistic MMC, preferably one in which the FMC love interest is on the spectrum as well.","I asked this question back at the general subreddit of book suggestions, but someone there recommended that I also give this subreddit a go in terms of asking for recommendations. I am looking for novels that feature an autistic male character involved in a romantic dynamic with a woman, preferably someone else who is on the spectrum.

Thus far, I managed to find *Act your Age, Eve Brown* by Talia Hibbert, which involves both an autistic MMC and an autistic FMC, but I was curious if there are various other stories out there that share this dynamic. I know there are romantic stories involving an autistic MMC such as *The Rosie Project* or *The Bride Test* but I am not sure if I am interested in those stories because a lot of reviewers seem to mention how the MMC in those stories act incredibly mathematically-minded, stoic and overall Sheldon Cooper-esque.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/uz5c2m/standalone_or_selfcontained_romance_stories_that/,2022-05-27T19:05:29Z,18,18,RomanceBooks,The Bride Test,POST

yle5uf,The Heart Principle by Helen Hoang: Am I the only one who is disappointed by this book? (No spoiler),"I have searched this subreddit, but haven't found anything about this topic, so I need to let it out and see if anyone had the same perspective about this book. 

I loved the first two books, The Kiss Quotient and The Bride Test, but The Heart Principle made me so furious that I'm still fuming. 

I understand Helen said that Anna, the FMC, is very close to her, but I couldn't stand her. And I'm not talking about the mental health struggles and downward spiral, because that is something that one can't always control and I don't even understand half of what people might go through in these situations. However, what I'm talking about is I feel like the MMC's, Quan, struggles, which fundamentally changed him not only physically but mentally and emotionally, were basically pushed aside only for him to provide love, care, understanding and support to Anna, all of which Anna didn't give back at all. 

Now, I understand this book was heavily focused on Anna's struggles, but then why make Quan go through such a terrible period, if throughout the book it's sitting on the sideline only to focus on Anna?! I feel like Quan's struggles were ignored to concentrate on Anna and whilst she had a horrible time struggling with her life, I didn't see any of the romantic aspect of the book, because it was all about Quan giving and Anna taking, taking, taking. At the end, even her ""redemption arc"" couldn't save her for me because I felt like Quan deserved more, way more and it was just a cop-out. 

Am I the only one who saw this side of the book? Because the only discussions I find are whether about the book being dark theme-wise or people loving the book.

Please, let's keep this discussion open-minded and polite :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/yle5uf/the_heart_principle_by_helen_hoang_am_i_the_only/,2022-11-03T20:38:27Z,29,66,RomanceBooks,The Bride Test,POST

I noticed this book on KU, it described having a H who was a grump. Grumpy Heros are one of my favorite troupes, so I thought why not give it a try?

If you liked The Rosie Project, The Kiss Quotient & The Bride Test, I think you will like the book. The H is not a grump, just misunderstood & there lots of hints to tell you he is on the spectrum without saying the words. 

My son was diagnosed being on the spectrum, and there are days I still worry about his future, 

I started reading romance novels last year after having my second baby during quarantine and needing a way to relax. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the books with representation of people that are not Neurotypical.

Stories with people who are successful, independent, are in love & have happy lives. I was blown away, I think the only example I had of people on Autism Spectrum Disorder was Rainman. 

The story was sweet, the h was likeable, and I can't recommend it enough.

There was one or two explicit sex scene, about as steamy as The Bride Test or The Kiss Quotient. 

I do want to mention a trigger warning just in case...

After three long years of war, starkly handsome Wynter Atrialan will have his vengeance on Summerlea's king by taking one of the man's beautiful, beloved daughters as his bride. But though peace is finally at hand, Wynter's battle with the Ice Heart, the dread power he embraced to avenge his brother's death, rages on.  
  
Khamsin Coruscate, Princess of Summerlea and summoner of Storms, has spent her life exiled to the shadows of her father's palace. Reviled by her father, marriage to Wintercraig's icy king was supposed to be a terrible punishment, but instead offers Kham her first taste of freedom—and her first taste of overwhelming passion.  
  
As fierce, indomitable Wynter weathers even Khamsin's wildest storms, surprising her with a tenderness she never expected, Kham wants more than Wynter's passion—she yearns for his love. But the power of the Ice Heart is growing, dangerous forces are gathering, and a devastating betrayal puts Khamsin and Wynter to the ultimate test.",https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GFZODB6,2023-12-03T13:48:54Z,4,12,RomanceBooks,The Bride Test,POST

gie05o,Books like The Kiss Quotient,"Okay, so I'm a little late to the party.

I read The Kiss Quotient last night and was completely blown away. I don't know why I put off reading this book for so long but it was so darn good...and now I want more.

Stella is probably the most real heroine that I've come across in a romance novel...maybe ever. I loved her inner monologue - it was equal parts clever, funny, and emotional. Her anxieties were described and written so honestly that I felt like I was experiencing everything right there with her. I like the idea of a heroine who isn't extremely outspoken but also isn't a quiet helpless little mouse who needs to be rescued all the damn time.

Having said that, I'm looking for books y'all think have a similar vibe. Doesn't have to be about autism or any sort of disorder, really. Just something kind of unique I guess. Something with a heroine who isn't perfect (but not a bitch), a non-asshole hero, and a some humour. Steam is much appreciated as well.

Edit: I'm currently reading The Bride Test

Thanks!

But when I started reading this book I JUST CANNOT PUT IT DOWN! IT WAS A F\*\*KING PAGE-TURNER Yes I agree that with the people on the sub that this book is in a different tone than the other 2, but that was the best part it shows Helen Hoang's writing has evolved! But kept the same vibe of the series, if I have to criticize tiny things it would be a tiny bit more spice and the ending could have paced out a bit better it was too rushed in the last 20 pages I don't mind making the ending a little longer. But overall 5/5. Her whole series is a 5/5! If I have to choose my least fave it would be The Bride Test I remember giving it a 4.5/5 mainly because the tone is a bit too comedic for my personal taste but overall a solid read! Yes to Michael, Yes to Khai, Yes to Quan! Yes to Stella, Yes to Esme, Yes to Anna!

jp5keh,"Unpopular opinion, but I find The Kiss Quotient to be very meh and underwhelming","I really hope I don’t get crucified for this post, lmao. But I find *The Kiss Quotient* to be very mediocre and overrated. This is one of those times when I genuinely feel like I’m reading a completely different book from everyone else. Usually, even when I read books I hate, I can still find one redeemable thing that makes me go, “Ok, I understand why some people would like this.” With TKQ, I literally can’t think of one thing I like about it. Maybe the font? Or when I finally finished the book?

I just couldn’t find the romance between Michael and Stella to be believable or compelling. I couldn’t find it in me to feel invested in their happy ending. The reason why is because their relationship is very sex- and attraction-based, but it doesn’t feel like there’s anything deeper, more substantial and meaningful than that. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a horny bitch, and I will always love reading about sexual tension and steamy scenes. However, when there’s no emotional connection or chemistry or *something* between the couple that’s not related to sex, I can’t buy a romance at all. To me, that’s just lust, not love. Maybe it’s the demisexual in me, but I’m one of those readers who need an authentic, emotional connection between the characters to like a book. And while sex scenes are great and all, I feel like anyone can write a good sex scene. But to write a beautiful, magical, heartwarming, emotional connection is what makes a book unforgettable to me. Steaminess will never matter to me nearly as much as emotional connection. And I don’t feel as if Michael and Stella have any at all. 

Throughout the book, I kept wishing for them to have thoughtful conversations where they get to know each other and appreciate one another. I kept wishing for goofy banter/teasing. I kept wishing for moments of romantic intimacy and vulnerability. I kept wishing for just *something*. I never felt like I got anything. They really didn’t seem to talk at all or have much in common outside the bedroom. Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like a relationship that’s built on just lust and nothing deeper doesn’t stand a great chance of lasting. I just feel like TKQ is full of so much lust but no real romance. It has a lot of sex in it but not enough substance, depth, and heart, IMO.

Another thing I want to mention is that I find both Michael and Stella to be very boring, bland, and uninteresting, particularly Michael. I just...don’t really get why he’s so well-loved? He feels so one-dimensional and dull to me. I absolutely love sweet, kind-hearted heroes, and while Michael is that, I find him to be utterly forgettable and uninspired. I think it’s because he feels too perfect to me. Like, that dude has no flaws. He’s patient, understanding, supportive, humble, talented, good in bed, etc. So I think I don’t like him, because he feels too perfect and unrealistic to me. But then I think about how I’ve read about other heroes in books who are similar to him in the sense that they also feel too perfect, yet in those books, I felt like things were so well-written that I completely overlooked that flaw and loved the hero anyway. I don’t know; I guess that the way Helen Hoang writes characters doesn’t feel immersive or engaging to me whatsoever. Her characters never feel fully formed and realized to me. I read about the things they go through, but I never once feel the emotions and struggles and happiness they experience. I feel so emotionally detached from the characters and the writing, utterly unable to feel the so-called love that the characters feel for each other. 

That being said, I will always, always appreciate this book for what it has done for people and for the book industry. My friend who read this book has autism, and she felt so understood and heard reading this book. That, to me, will always be sacred and precious. Also, as a minority, I’m so grateful that this book promotes racial, as well as neurodivergent, diversity, which is something we desperately need more of in books. I’m so happy that this book has taught publishers that stories featuring marginalized characters who are of color and who are neurodivergent can still sell, so I’ll always respect Helen Hoang for that. Hopefully, this will pave the road for even more diverse books in the future that are better written than this, lol. 

Lastly, I just want to ask y’all if you think I should read *The Bride Test*. I feel like I’m going to hate that one, too, but it has so much diversity that I want to read it just for that reason alone. However, I’m so torn. My sister who’s read *The Bride Test* says it’s similar to TKQ, in the sense that it’s also full of so much sex but no romance/emotional connection. I also hear many people on this sub say that they absolutely love TKQ yet couldn’t get into TBT. But then I also know people who hate TKQ but love TBT. So I feel so undecided. If you’re willing to share, please give me your thoughts on TBT and if you think I should give Hoang a second chance. Thank you in advance!

(I just realized I kind of roasted a book that’s so well-loved on this sub. Please don’t dox me or ban me, lmao. I swear to God, I’m a really nice person. *gives you chocolates so you don’t hate me, send me death threats, and downvote this post to oblivion)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/jp5keh/unpopular_opinion_but_i_find_the_kiss_quotient_to/,2020-11-06T14:01:16Z,49,113,RomanceBooks,The Bride Test,POST
iah7hd,Looking for books where the ML is a POC,"After the post earlier this week about diversity, I’ve been thinking more about the male leads and lack of diversity there. I know there has been some good progress lately and am looking for books I may not have already come across where the male lead is not white. I’d especially like to find some where the male lead is Asian (I do love picturing me some Choi Si Won circa She Was Pretty with that 5 o’clock shadow and that smile... mmm - I need to go watch that mini series again). Asian men seem to rarely be portrayed as desirable in popular culture and that’s just got to change. But I’d also love to read any book with some male lead racial diversity.

Red White and Royal Blue
The Proposal

Flat share  (guessing based on cover)
The Boyfriend Project  (guessing based on cover)
Love Her or Lose Her (nervous about reading this one as I have a bad feeling about stereotypes based on the only other book I have read by this author)

Make sure:
• Only **ONE** of the MC should be fluent in eng.
•Only contemporary romance please. 

So I'm just wondering whether there is a book like this , kinda like Love in English by Karina Halle , but with the FMC being the one who is not that good in English.

**I'm open to any tropes , as long as its a CR!**

P.S: Please make sure the book you are recommending is NOT written in 3rd person POV and only written in 1st person perspective.

Get your stars, opinions, questions and rants/raves ready! 

Goodreads summary: 

>**One Christmas wish, two brothers, and a lifetime of hope are on the line for hapless Maelyn Jones in** ***In a Holidaze*****, the quintessential holiday romantic novel by Christina Lauren, the** ***New York Times*** **bestselling author of** ***The Unhoneymooners.***  
It’s the most wonderful time of the year…but not for Maelyn Jones. She’s living with her parents, hates her going-nowhere job, and has just made a romantic error of epic proportions.  
But perhaps worst of all, this is the last Christmas Mae will be at her favorite place in the world—the snowy Utah cabin where she and her family have spent every holiday since she was born, along with two other beloved families. Mentally melting down as she drives away from the cabin for the final time, Mae throws out what she thinks is a simple plea to the universe: *Please. Show me what will make me happy.*  
The next thing she knows, tires screech and metal collides, everything goes black. But when Mae gasps awake…she’s on an airplane bound for Utah, where she begins the same holiday all over again. With one hilarious disaster after another sending her back to the plane, Mae must figure out how to break free of the strange time loop—and finally get her true love under the mistletoe.  
Jam-packed with yuletide cheer, an unforgettable cast of characters, and Christina Lauren’s trademark “downright hilarious” (Helen Hoang, author of *The Bride Test*) hijinks, this swoon-worthy romantic read will make you believe in the power of wishes and the magic of the holidays.

So the book is Jo Goodman's [debut novel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52104728-the-captain-s-lady-author-s-cut-edition) originally published in **1984** as yes...wait for it...***Passion's Bride***  ugh, [terrible title for this book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2585590-passion-s-bride)...just awful...but definitely typical of the era!! and later renamed/rereleased in 1998 with another [unworthy cover](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/614475.The_Captain_s_Lady) and another inappropriate title suggested by the publisher... ***Captain's Bride*** (NO one gets married in this book, damnit)...and [neither title are Jo Goodman's fault](https://www.jogoodman.com/the-captains-lady/)...her preferred title was *Dark Lady* (the name of the heroine's ship)...and the cover art never comes close either. **There** ***should*** **be some fabulous oil painting of Captain Alexis Danty in her swashbuckling black garb standing on the deck of her ship!**...so I can only conclude that it is this combo of ill-advised titles and covers that has contributed to this book languishing in obscurity!

I picked up (now titled) ***The*** ***Captain's Lady*** on KU...and while [the blurb sounded good](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52104728-the-captain-s-lady-author-s-cut-edition) (*check the blurb for a more straightforward plot set-up*)...I frankly had low to moderate expectations, I **do know** Jo Goodman can write emotionally intelligent ADULTS...BUT I've read enough 1980s bodice rippers to have certain umm expectations going in...AND THEN this book just kept surprising me...again and again...had I misread the date?? This IS NOT a typical 1980s bodice ripper At ALL!! what an anomaly this is!!👀

[Completely erroneous title and cover hiding a Buried Treasure!](https://preview.redd.it/3e0dp3tuqw561.jpg?width=321&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82c76da62651a7d385e75ed6c1f6ea9d945dfd29)

Here is a fierce and intelligent female lead...not a Mary Sue...Not TSTL...Not perky, coy or so sweet you need to brush your teeth... BUT determined...pragmatic...driven... looking the hero in the eye and talking to him straight...and then him replying to her, just as straight...hell yeah!! **Add in her evolution to Lady Sea Captain + forced proximity + their undeniable attraction to each other + disagreeing about her vow of vengeance for her loved ones + but eventually respecting the other's motivations**...yep! works for me!

And Goodman's hero here surprised me as well...turns out Captain Tanner Cloud is a serious gamma hero...strong, intelligent and actually worthy of the force of nature that is Alexis Danty, the heroine...I was frankly a bit worried at first, that he wouldn't be worthy of her...He originally sees her swimming in the ocean...but rather than drooling over her body...Cloud admires her physical strength as she tests herself against the current...and it goes on from there. Yes, he wants her, desires her, but not based solely on her appearance...**it is her strength of character and skills that attract him**, again and again.

""*Alex Danty is on a personal mission. She will never join us. She is after only one man and if she finds him she will stop. She doesn’t kill or plunder. She offers men liberty from impressment because she happens to find them before Travers. It was never her purpose to do it, and freeing them is not what sustains her. If she joined us she would be losing time from her pursuit. Our goal is not hers.*”

And Goodman allows both Alex and Cloud to be a bit imperfect...and more importantly, allows them to grow as their relationship progresses!! I also like a **hero in pursuit**...and >!especially like when they say the words first...without knowing if the heroine feels the same.!<

And as these two get to know each other...just the way they mentally understand how the other thinks...so so good!! **They respect each other**!! and understand *even* when they don't agree with choices or decisions the other makes!!

""*You might just be able to make it, Alex,” he whispered, to give her strength. “And you might just be able to stop me,” she said, returning it.*""

And y'all know how my little historian's heart beats for an author that can skillfully weave a story into actual historical events...which Goodman does with aplomb here...the backdrop ends up being events leading to the War of 1812...notably the British boarding and impressment of sailors often brutally into the British navy...as well as the history of privateers and pirates...here Goodman manages to weave Jean Lafitte into her story in a convincing manner as a supporting character...tricky using actual historical personages but Goodman pulls it off.

A few other notes...Goodman manages to avoid the worst of the 1980s bad sex scene euphemisms🔥 ...so that was appreciated...but just skips any mention of contraception, sigh...typical also of this period in the genre. The most notable flaw was the complete absence of POC in a Caribbean setting...in fact the villain is the only one to make *any* reference, which comes very late in the story...and the other characters are angered by the callousness in his references. Now, especially coming off Alyssa Cole's fabulous Civil War romance, it really stuck out...there should have been all kinds of POC especially when the ships are in port in the islands and in Washington DC...however, I do consider context as a reader (in this case, what publishers were and were not printing)...and while the absence of POC is a serious flaw, seeing as this was written in the 1980s, I appreciated that there were at least no cringe worthy stereotypes. I would like to think if Goodman was writing this today she would have figured out how to include POC without just side-stepping them.

Finally this book is, as books from this era are, almost twice as long as today's HR tend to be...which I love!...first the length allows Goodman to keep the pace steady, without rushing along too much...we get those moments of detail as the story progresses.

Are you one of those readers that get frustrated that JUST as the couple gets together, boom💥 the story is over...well, not a problem here...there are some terrific scenes of them together just being a couple, making plans, supporting each other...and the intricate plot has time to unwind as well. oh...also the BIG plot twist at the end had full-on 80s vibes, but I was invested in the characters at that point and Goodman sold it for me! >!I also think the end might have gone a bit differently if this was written today!!<

✨This book isn't perfect...frankly, no book is...there are always threads that can be pulled and criticized...a book either works for you or it doesn't, and this one:

* solid well thought-out prose
* a strong, smart, capable heroine
* an equally strong but emotionally intelligent hero who can express his feelings
* at odds but still supportive of each other = good tension
* against a great historical backdrop, with political machinations
* a heroine who wants vengeance against the person who has murdered her loved ones
* with good supporting characters
* a nice bit of forced proximity
* and competence all around
* the pining while separated
* trusting the other person
* nice steam!! 🔥
* yes! this works for me...**On👏The👏🏼Keeper👏Shelf!**

CW: >!some scenes of violence w/ flogging, a stabbing...sword fight...battle scenes...and racist references to POC by the villain at the very end!<

r1ks4h,Trying to replicate the feeling The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood gave me. Love this silly book.,"There's not one specific thing about this book that made me love it so much. It might just be the right time right book situation but it really had me. It's been so long since I've read anything that had me physically reacting so strongly. I was laughing out loud, I was blushing, I was kicking my feet in excitement at all the cringe and awkwardness like one of those teenage girls in the movies who just got a date with the star quarterback. I was feeling it all. It's been a few weeks since I've read this book and I'm still thinking about it. That rarely happens anymore.

There's something about this book that just mixed together all the things I love in just the right combo. I totally thought I would hate this book. I'm so used to published fanfiction and wattpad novels being cringey and poorly written that I avoided this book forever just because of the fact it was fanfiction first. I will not lie, I am extremely picky on my fanfiction and cycle between the same 5 fandoms. This is a fandom I'm not in, that I have large mix feelings about and a couple I thought I hated based on the movies. I picked it up as a joke. I think that really might just be the reason why I like this book honestly. I went in with low expectations and came out with the type of book hangover I get after a really good fic in my comfort fandom. Which is why I'm so surprised this book hit me this hard. Needless to say after this book I looked up Ali Hazelwood's AO3 and went to town and I am desperately waiting for her new books to come out.

Anyways.

It was every one of my favorite fanfic tropes thrown together in a perfect mix:

\- Older MMC in a mentorship role to FMC but without direct power. I cannot express how happy I was that Olive was not directly under Adam as his student and he wasn't on her committee it's too easy for that to be a plot point and cause unnecessary pain. 

\-Fake dating (and all similar tropes including arranged marriage and forced proximity).

\-Science!  

\-Plot and thoughts from both characters outside of just getting together.

\-Secretly Pinning MMC.

\-Grumpy/Sunshine.

\-"" I hate everyone but you/ I'll kill you if you touch her"" MMC & ""only nice to you"" trope.

\-Banter & inside jokes.

\-Praise Kink.

\-Dramatic confessions.

\-Major Height Difference.

\-Miscommunication but not to the point of pure stupidity. Close, but not over my threshold.

\- Everything about Chapter 16. Especially Adam's POV. I need a book just from his POV.

\-Everyone knowing but the main couple that they're truly in love.

\-No love triangle! I do like reverse harem and it's cool if multiple people like one of the characters but I liked that Adam and Olive clearly only had eyes for each other the whole time and jealousy wasn't a major miscommunication issue other than the occasional Jeremy reference.

\-Overall fluffy with light angst but not to the point where their every interaction now reads as sad and slightly unenjoyable (I'm looking at you first 200 pages of *People We Meet On Vacation*).

\-Ending doesn't feel overly rushed.

&#x200B;

There's plenty of things people could dislike about this book and I truly had multiple ""Omg why/how"" moments when reading it but the fact that a book gave me all the feels on the spectrum without having me DNF out of sheer frustration when I had those moments is something else.

The only other CR books that made me this happy were *The Kiss Quotient* and *The Bride Test*. I've tried replicating it by reading *The Soulmate Equation*, *People We Meet on Vacation*, and *The Unhoneymooners* (so far off of this sub's great recommendations) but it hasn't been the same. *The Unhoneymooners* was another 5 star read for me but it wasn't flailing in my bed and silently screaming at 2 am read. I am still looking for books to get me out of this slump but I'll get there eventually. Myabe if Ali ever releases a full length novel from Adam's POV.

I know everyone has gushed about this book and then some but it's my new comfort read that has gotten me through seasonal and global issue depression and if anyone just needs something light and silly to get through the holiday craziness I'd recommend this over and over again for that perfect escapism.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/r1ks4h/trying_to_replicate_the_feeling_the_love/,2021-11-25T01:41:29Z,16,60,RomanceBooks,The Bride Test,POST
uga9a3,"Book recs in the vein of Evie Dunmore, Elizabeth Kingston or Denise Williams in contemporary romance? (+ some review babbling of my April reads)","First time poster here and recently hooked on romance literature, I've read around 30 romance books over the past two months, some of them recommended in this sub (thank you!). I've looked around on Goodreads, Amazon recs and searching the sub but I figured I'll write a post like a human being and ask for 'like-minded' recs. 

Here's a recap of my April reads and what I liked in particular and looking for more of:

1. **The League of Extraordinary Women series by Evie Dunmore** (all 3 of them) = I really love this series, particularly the political and historical feminist aspect. In **""A rogue of one's own"" and ""Portrait of a Scotsman""**: I loved the personality contrast in the pairings and Scotland / Scots always get extra points in my book. If I had to rank my favorite type of men, both male leads are in my top 5 even though they're very different. I think the author has a great way of portraying both women and men in both books, especially how these women navigate a deeply unequal society and advocate for those who don't have a voice while advocating for themselves as individuals, and how men become unexpected allies. Also 🔥🔥🔥 
2. **Elizabeth Kingston's ""The King's Man"" and ""Fair, Bright and Terrible""** = these 2 are actually recs I found on the sub (thank you!) and I was surprisingly pleased with both books. At first I thought the medieval setting would not be my thing, but the particular historical and political themes actually made me love the series, especially the story of the conquest of Wales, which I did not know anything about. ""The King's Man"" was my favorite romance-wise; I loved the Fantaghiro / Mulan character, especially because it wasn't caricatural >!(as in the female character was portrayed as not very feminine, not attractive, not charismatic in an obvious way and still a strong leader, a woman who torn between two conditions and how to maintain her agency without betraying a greater cause)!<. 
3. After a long detour in Regency romance in March, I started reading more **contemporary** stuff as well in April. Some of them I didn't like (""Fool me once"" by Ashley Winstead or ""The Heart Principle""), but I found one standout: **""The fastest way to fall"" by Denise Williams**. I have another standout, but it's **a Regency one ""Never Fall For Your Fiancée"" by Virginia Heath**. What I most enjoyed about these two is the Bridget Jones with less baggage / ""level up"" vibe in ""TFWTF"" and the fact that the lead male character was a working class self made man (a bit like the guy from ""Portrait of a Scotsman""). As for ""NFFYF"", it just made me laugh out loud throughout (yay escapism)! 
4. S**ome books I didn't like or didn't connect with:** Helen Hoang's ""Kiss Quotient"" and ""The heart principle"". The latter was just too heavy and I didn't like the female lead because she was too passive and wishy washy (although I loved Quan because tattoos + vulnerability = magic). I didn't like the female leads in ""Fool me once"" or ""Act your age Eve Brown"" (Talia Hibbert) and ""Get a life Chloe Brown"": the first one was just a horrible selfish person IMO, the second one was too entitled and childish and the other Brown sister was entitled and obnoxious (although I was in love with Red throughout the book - because tattoos + vulnerability + working class Brit humor and attitude = kryptonite). 
5. **Honorable mentions:** ""Bringing down the duke"" by Evie Dunmore (cool but both leads were a bit bland compared to the rest of the series), ""Twice Shy"" by Sarah Hogle (tbh I found the male character really strangely written personality wise and I was more into the fixer-upper stuff lol), ""How to fail at flirting"" by Denise Williams (great love at first sight premise but I don't know why the male lead gave me borderline narcissistic / abusive vibes). 
6. **Currently on my list to read:** I have **""The bride test""** by Hoang (mostly because I'm a completionist and I'm intrigued by the main female character as someone who's trying to find a better life) and **""Desire Lines""** which is the third book of Kingston's Welsh Blades series. There's a lot of books I'm waiting on that aren't released yet (notably from **Ali Hazelwood - I loved ""The Love Hypothesis""** as it was the perfect mix of academia, nerds in STEM, serious issues mixed with 🔥) but other than that, I don't know what to read next... 

Any good books to share based on all that ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/uga9a3/book_recs_in_the_vein_of_evie_dunmore_elizabeth/,2022-05-01T21:46:56Z,7,6,RomanceBooks,The Bride Test,POST
tf7cbz,Series Review: The Smythe-Smith Quartet by Julia Quinn,"Over the past couple of weeks, I've read the entire Smythe-Smith Quartet. Why? Because I apparently didn't have enough projects already so I decided to read them and create a TVTropes page for the series. Here's how it went.

\*SPOILERS - PLOT SUMMARIES OF LATER BOOKS WILL NEED TO REFERENCE PREVIOUS BOOKS.

1. Just Like Heaven (M/F)

Rating: 4/5

Tropes: Childhood friend, brother's best friend/best friend's sister, opposites attract (shy/outgoing), caregiving (injury and infection), slow burn, Regency era

Summary: Honoria Smythe-Smith is the youngest of her siblings. Her older brother (second youngest sibling), Daniel, the Earl of Winstead, fled the country after a duel. When Honoria returns to London for the season, she happens to encounter Daniel's best friend, Marcus Holroyd, the Earl of Chatteris. Through some shenanigans that lead to Marcus suffering a twisted ankle and then a life-threatening fever due to an infected wound, Honoria and Marcus grow closer and closer, culminating at the infamous annual Smythe-Smith musicale, where Honoria is slated to perform in a string quartet with her other eligible female cousins. Review: This is a sweet story and one of my personal favorite Julia Quinn novels. Honoria is not the most complex MFC, but she doesn't need to be; she's generally kind and straightforward, with a bit of a mischievous streak. Marcus is a more reserved MMC who is - refreshingly - not described as having some kind of crazy god-tier looks. He's pretty unproblematic in his behavior with Honoria and his main conflict is internal; he's shy and has some difficulty expressing his affection for Honoria, and that is made more complicated by his loyalty to his best friend. I enjoyed the slow burn as they got to know each other better, and there was a good amount of humor without getting too wacky.

2. A Night Like This (M/F)

Rating: 3/5

TRIGGER WARNINGS: Sexual assault (by an antagonist); stalking (by an antagonist); kidnapping.

Tropes: Dark and troubled past, love at first sight, class difference, playing with the children,

Summary: Daniel Smythe-Smith, the Earl of Winstead, returns home on the day of the annual Smythe-Smith musicale. During the performance, he is captivated by a mysterious woman, who turns out to be Anne Wynter, governess to three of his young cousins. Daniel starts spending time with his cousins so that he can see Anne again. While Daniel is clearly head over heels for Anne, Anne hesitates because she has a complicated past. A dangerous man from Anne's past reappears and is willing to go through just about anyone to get to her. With some help from his friends, Daniel is able to rescue Anne and they live HEA.

Review: This book was fine. I'm fond of Anne - she is intelligent, witty, and has a nice and shiny steel backbone that was clearly forged by her past. Daniel is a good partner for her - he reads her body language well and does not push her when it is clear that she is afraid of someone. The book surrounding them is alright, but it could have been better. I wasn't fond of their first meeting and how quickly Daniel insisted on kissing Anne. That scene was told from his perspective and usually I'm willing to go along with love at first sight, but I was more curious about what that scene was like for Anne, especially after learning more about her past later on. The antagonist was a bit on the cartoonishly evil side, even by romance novel standards - with some more subtlety, he might not have worn out his welcome quite so quickly.

3. The Sum of All Kisses (M/F)

Rating: 2/5

TRIGGER WARNINGS: Domestic violence (implied; by an antagonist); homophobia (period piece) with mentions of what is essentially conversion therapy; blatant, super gross misogyny (by an antagonist)

Tropes: Enemies to lovers, opposites attract, Pride and Prejudice-esque, forced proximity

Summary: Sarah Pleinsworth and Hugh Prentice, who do not like each other, end up seated next to each other at Honoria and Marcus's wedding. At first, they begrudgingly agree to keep things civil for their friends' sake, but as they spend more time together during the celebrations, and during the lead to Anne and Daniel's wedding, their hatred softens into tolerance and then actual feelings for each other. They have to contend with Hugh's horrible father, the Marquis of Ramsgate, before they can make their relationship official.

Review: Hoo boy. This book really tested my willpower - I was sorely tempted to DNF. I was not feeling Sarah Pleinsworth at all. Her truly awful behavior - self-centered, self-righteous, hypersensitive - turned me off early on, especially because when confronted about her behavior, the narrative validated her instead of giving her a chance to learn and grow organically. The pacing is a hot mess, and the conflict(?) really only takes shape in the last 25%-ish of the book. It resolves way too easily with a ""bargain"" was still a shitty deal for the leads (I was surprised that no one in-universe commented on it). The horrifically awful main antagonist might as well have gotten a slap on the wrist from all this. Hugh Prentice earned the 2 pretty much entirely on his own - I related much more to him than I ever did to Sarah, and I found his intelligence and moments of awkwardness endearing. He deserved a better partner and a better story.

4. The Secrets of Sir Richard Kenworthy

Rating: 2/5

TRIGGER WARNINGS: Pregnancy (secondary character); manipulation

Tropes: Whirlwind courtship, secretive partner, the Regency equivalent of a shotgun wedding

Summary: Richard Kenworthy attends the Smythe-Smith musicale in search of a bride. He takes an immediate interest in Iris Smythe-Smith, courts her, and proposes marriage. He then purposely puts her in a compromising position, which forces them to marry quickly with a special license that he already had ready for the occasion. (⛳️⛳️⛳️) Iris adjusts to being the lady of the house and Iris and Richard continue to fall in love with each other. Richard's secret reasons for marrying Iris come to light, and it eventually works out for their HEA.

Review: I was hoping to end on a happier note after Book 3. Nope. I refused to DNF and suffered through this for the sake of completion and hopefully warning someone else away from this book. This time, it's Iris Smythe-Smith's turn to join the ""you deserved better"" club. Everything that's wrong with this book is in the title. Richard Kenworthy is an awful MMC, and the secret in question is so, so stupid. >!He rushes Iris into marriage and wants her to pretend to be pregnant in order to cover for his younger sister being pregnant out of wedlock!!< What he did was manipulative and cruel, and I was unable to give even a single fuck about him catching feelings for Iris because his actions left such a bad taste in my mouth. Like Book 3, the main conflict doesn't really hit until the last 25% of the book and then it resolves a little too neatly. And Like Hugh, Iris earns the 2 all by herself - I wish I could give her more, but the story didn't give her the chance to shine that she deserved.

Closing Thoughts: It's unfortunate that this is such an uneven series. I like this fictional universe and the first book had so much promise, but the last two books were genuinely difficult for me to finish. I can solidly recommend Just Like Heaven, though - it's a lovely lighthearted romance that still sticks around in my head.

Even my questions below will include spoilers. I'm not requiring anyone to use the spoiler codes. Feel free to discuss the very last page of the book without worrying about it.

Who got to read the book? What did you think? **Here are some questions to get us going, but this is a free-for-all. Feel free to ask your own questions, share your highlighted portions, and talk about your feelings. Don't feel like you have to answer any or all of these.**

**Also, I have more questions than usual this time, because I found the book particularly thought-provoking. So did a lot of members- we've had multiple threads about Beach Read in the last month. So if you wrote your review and posted it already, feel free to post it or parts of it here again, if you want new/different conversations with people!**

&#x200B;

* On a scale of 1-5, how did you like the book? If you feel like it, explain how your personal rating system works.
* To start off with, a question from u/Phoenix_RebornAgain and u/BrontesRule, which I think is going to be the big question of the book club: ""What genre would you categorize this book? If you feel the book was inaccurately classified, did this impact your enjoyment of the book?""
   * [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/hu0m6w/trend_in_romance_or_marketing_tactic/?sort=new) by u/SGRuiz was related and thought-provoking. In the mod chat, we've been ""arguing"" about whether it's ""chick lit"", (or lady lit or women's fiction or whatever other term you wanna use) or general romance. I'm curious what y'all think. I'll save my own opinions for the comments.
   * u/BrontesRule points out the popular quote: ""If you swapped out all my Jessicas for Johns, do you know what you’d get? Fiction. Just fiction. Ready and willing to be read by anyone, but somehow by being a woman who writes about women, I’ve eliminated half the Earth’s population from my potential readers, and you know what? I don’t feel ashamed of that. I feel pissed."" Do you agree?
* This book had lots of meta-aspects, being a book that wrote about romance books. Did you like it? I loved it and thought it was especially appropriate for our book club. What are some meta parts that caught your attention? For example: her name is JANUARY. Such a twee, special, romance-heroine name, lol. Also, when Gus uses the phrase ""Happy for now"", which is widely used in romance circles to describe a certain kind of ending.
* Another thing I loved (I am \*not\* being partial in these questions lol) about the book was how it examined several different types of love. Love was so prevalent, even if it wasn't always the romantic love. The relationship with Shadi and January was heartwarming, especially when January basically said she'd fallen in love with Shadi when she met her, but we understand it's platonic love. And the love between January and her father (weird or not? discuss), between Pete, Maggie, and Gus.
* What did you think about the books Gus and January wrote?
* Did you like the cult side story? What did you think about the fact that they had sex in that tent? A beautiful moment of rewriting hope and love over something ugly, or more a disrespectful moment?
* Ok, I have so many other questions I could ask, so I'm just going to leave it on this: how did you find the slow burn/sexual tension/the fact that the romance didn't really ramp up until the last 30%?
   * I have thoughts, and highlighted passages, on this. Lol. At one point I wrote to u/BrontesRule: ""They almost kissed after January's cry session and just the \*almost\* of it was hotter than some other sex scenes I've read""",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/hulovw/book_club_discussion_beach_read_by_emily_henry/,2020-07-20T13:57:29Z,299,49,RomanceBooks,Beach Read,POST

Would love to open up a discussion on why you like or don’t like Emily Henry’s writing, because I adore it and wouldn’t mind the insight! 

Here’s my like list: 

- She makes me laugh out loud
- her characters feel real 
- she nails the slow burn 
- I fall in love along with her characters

19f2fee,Beach Read by Emily Henry Fancast - Victoria Pederetti & Sean Teale,"I highly recommend you watch clips of them from Sean Teale’s movie: Rosaline (his voice is so hot) and Victoria Pederetti’s show You.
Also it’s so crazy because this is exactly how I pictured both of them also to all of the people fan casting a person who is white to play Gus: 

“I looked up and there he was. Olive skin. Cheekbones that could cut you. Crooked mouth and a husky voice I’d never forget. Messy, dark hair I could immediately picture haloed in fluorescent light” 

I’m sorry but Sean Teale is that man. 

I will put clips up of them in another post, it won’t let me put them up here unfortunately. But here’s some links:

14mndw4,Hot beach vacation read recommendations please!,"We’re officially in summer and I’m about to spend three weeks on a tropical vacation for my 30th birthday. Obviously that means I need steamy books set on a tropical beach vacation to gush over!

I’d prefer it to have at least 4 🌶️ HOT HOT 🥵 sex scenes (from fingering to fucking to bondage for each is fine!), HEA, and light hearted comedy. It could be contemporary, sci-fi, fantasy, reverse harem, F/F.

What I don’t want is a honeymoon, failed marriage, wedding/failed wedding, cheating, second act break up, FMC sad after recent break up. 

For once, I’ll be buying physical books so a big plus if it’s got a cute cover! I’m one of the few in this sub, it seems, that actually really enjoys the cartoon covers.

h81rbe,Beach Read by Emily Henry,"Welcome to another installment of 🎉Drag🎉Your🎉Favorites🎉, the review series where we talk about The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of /r/romancebooks popular titles. 

This time I’m dragging [Beach Read by Emily Henry](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/608898/beach-read-by-emily-henry/).

This book isn’t *technically* a sub favorite.  It was published in May of this year, so it’s still pretty new, but it seems to be favored highly by those who have read it and definitely experienced a burst of popularity not too long ago.  I wanted to read it, so I figured why the hell not?  

*Fine Print:  This is not an Official Thing^TM so don’t blame the mods.  There will be spoilers; wherever possible I have used spoiler tags, but those things are incredibly fickle so proceed at your own risk.*


**The Good**

I fucking *loved* this book for so many reasons.  Typically I don’t read a lot of contemporary romance; it feels so cheesy and contrived a lot of the time.  Not this one!

First, this book was fucking funny.  People around the sub are always talking about humor and clever, witty banter.  Maybe I’m a miser, but so many of those books are barely funny.  I might crack a smile.  But Henry had me actually laughing out loud at several points.  January and Gus both have a wry sense of humor and the banter between them was always entertaining.  January is almost constantly ribbing Gus; at one point she asks him, “what do you weigh, Gus?  Three beer cans, some bones, and a cigarette?”  

January’s dry wit coupled with Henry’s excellent timing created some truly hilarious narration.  The scene >!at the book club meeting had me in a fit of the giggles.  The purse wine killed me and her growing horror at the book club was capped off by the dog farting on her!<.  Surely it’s not funny in my recap, but Henry does an absolute perfect job with the timing and delivery; her jokes are well-integrated into the narration and dialogue.  Other books are supposed to be funny; this one actually is.

The plot felt natural and real.  I had my reservations about the premise of two authors, neighbors, who decide to try each other’s genres.  Reading about authors seemed a little meta to me and I was concerned that the plotline would be very dull; did I really want to read about writing a book?  In a way, the story *was* somewhat meta, as I feel like this book followed a more literary path than the other contemporary romances I’ve read— the book pushed toward lit fic, the genre the heroine was trying on for the first time.  I won’t say the writing was highbrow, definitely not Tartt or Kingsolver or Morrison or Eggers, but the it certainly felt mature and polished, prosaic and evocative.  More than I expected from a book like this, with a cover like that.

There were several lines of prose that struck me as particularly elegant.  At one point Henry describes January’s response to a moment shared between the two main characters: “Something about that made my insides feel like a ribbon being drawn across scissors until it curled.”  Later, >!after January and Gus finally have sex, they lie together, and Gus explores January, lovingly kissing her across various parts of her body.!<. Henry describes it as Gus “whispering secrets through [January’s] bones.”  Another time January clutches Gus, wishing “[her] grip could stop time.”  

Perhaps those descriptions and words resonated so closely with me because they echoed exactly what I’ve felt before when falling in love, almost as if she had written my own thoughts and experience.

The relationship between January and Gus is most definitely a slow burn.  I wouldn’t exactly call myself a lover of that trope, but it absolutely worked in this book.  Their relationship grows organically.  We watch as Henry builds their connection from former college acquaintances to tentative friendship, then a real friendship built on respect that moves to mutual attraction to a very personal kind of love.   The heat and tension between them climbs slowly but steadily before it finally *releases* >!(against the bookshelves, of course)!< — only to begin mounting again as >!the characters pull away from each other in the wake of outside personal issues!<.

These characters are so genuine.  They are both carrying an incredible amount of grief: >!loss,
abuse, family shit, exes, professional pressure!<. The internal conflicts the characters experience are rich, which makes both Gus and January such real, dynamic characters.  Those internal conflicts intersect to create equally rich external conflicts.  Rather than a frustrating, manufactured Great Misunderstanding, the characters come to a natural crossroads in their relationship as a result of these conflicts.  I never had that moment of JUST TELL HIM/HER.  Henry carried that aspect of the plot gracefully.

There’s an enemies-to-lovers aspect to these two that I liked.  They start out contentiously,  with almost-rude behavior somewhat leftover from their college rivalry days.  But even that is real and believable considering that rivalry was borne out of a weird combination of creative respect and jealousy (something a lot of us writers probably experience).  >!Not to mention their latent sexual attraction.  The frat party dance scene?  Whoa momma!<. Henry does an excellent job filling that out and folds in the humor seamlessly.  She describes the differences in perception of male and female, serious and “fluff” writers, and the disparate ways the industry itself treats them with such clever sarcasm and contempt.  And there’s that meta aspect again— Henry is clearly calling out the publishing world for its sexism and unequal treatment of female writers and female fiction.

Also, no one has green eyes and everyone is a normal height.  Gus is certainly attractive, in a reasonably fit sultry tortured genius emo boy kind of way.  >!Exactly how I like them!<. January is hardly described at all, and I’m actually very cool with that, because appearance was not really the basis of their attraction— it was that mutual creative respect that really drew them together, in my opinion.


**The Bad**

There were some pacing issues after the hookup.  >!January’s protracted approach to dealing with the aftermath of her dad’s death and the realization of his affair dragged on for me.  The grieving process is complicated, for sure.  But it took just a little too long for January to get to the point and deal with the messages her dad left behind for her.  That, and his somewhat weird letters to her, kinda killed some of the momentum for me, even though the emotion of that loss heightened the uncertainty of her relationship with Gus!<.

Additionally, the portion of the end of the story that is a sort of conclusion but not exactly an epilogue was also kind of dry and slow.  >!It’s unintentionally meta here, because the ending to January’s novel, which is somewhat of a mirror for the story Henry is telling here, is lame!<.

Overall, not a super strong ending.  It’s not a Stephen King disaster, but it did fizzle for me.


**The Ugly**

nhh6fw,I finally read Beach Read and it destroyed me in the best way,"As a frequent visitor to the sub, I, of course, have known for a while that this book exists and is highly recommended but I kept putting off reading it for a while. I don't really know why. Maybe somewhere deep down I knew I should save it for a rainy day. Or maybe not.

Well, I finally read it and it destroyed me but also fixed me. I want to hug January. And Gus. And also my parents. And my boyfriend. I missed dinner because I was too busy reading and sobbing into my pillow. 

I've been in a funk lately. Just lost interest in everything. DNF'd soooo many books. But now I feel alive again. Do I feel alive because I read book? Or did I read the book because I was ready to feel again? I don't know and it doesn't matter.

Anyway my point is if you haven't read it yet, go read it. Right now. This minute. Or don't. Maybe you'll read it too at just the right time when you need it.

i1vfdl,Beach Read different endings? [Spoilers],"I finished reading Beach Read by Emily Henry yesterday and I loved it! While reading other reviews I noticed that there seem to be two different versions of the ending…? 

In one ending, >!January and Gus spend his birthday reading their new books together on the beach and have a Happy-For-Now moment. !< This is the ending I read, and I thought it fit wonderfully. 

In the other ending, >!Gus ends up having the big party for his birthday and proposes to January.!< I definitely think that would have been way too early in their relationship and to be honest, if I read the version with this ending, I think I would have liked this book a lot less. 

I'm not sure which ending is the 'real' one, but I hope it's the one I read. It found it to be the perfect way for them to process what had happened in their lives and for them to show growth and healing, both individually and together.

Which ending did you read? Which do you like better?

rwehta,Beach Read vs. People We Meet on Vacation,"Did anyone else heavily prefer one of these books by Emily Henry over the other?

I read Beach Read first and then PWMOV because of the crazy hype on this sub, goodreads, Amazon, etc. I loved Beach Read and was excited for PWMOV because it seemed so much more popular. I think I might’ve felt differently if I’d read PWMOV first. 

But I felt really let down after reading PWMOV, the book felt a little above average at best. I didn’t feel much of a connection to Alex and Poppy, and was super let down about the “major” event that led to their falling out. I will give Emily Henry major props on her ability to describe characters and scenes. 

With Beach Read, I just fell in love with January and Gus. There were so many scenes and lines that I would just keep rereading over and over again. I love how they opened up to each other on each little adventure they went on. I will admit that Alex did treat Poppy better than Gus did to January (at times). I also loved how they were both slowly healing from their personal life traumas together. I preferred Emily Henry’s writing style in this one a lot more, but I’m not sure how to describe it. 

I’d love to know what people think of both books, especially if they strongly prefer one over the other.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/rwehta/beach_read_vs_people_we_meet_on_vacation/,2022-01-05T04:50:54Z,28,34,RomanceBooks,Beach Read,POST

13nkvnr,Beach Read Challenge Post #1 (With Taylor Swift Songs!),"Since I am on summer break, I decided to do a beach read challenge where I try to read as many fun summer reads as I can! I thought I would post my thoughts on the first two here in case anyone else has read the books. 

**Book 1: The Summer of Broken Rules by K.L. Walther** 

I was a little hesitant to pick up this book since I feel like I've grown out of YA romance, but this book was super cute! I have always been obsessed with the game assassin ever since reading P.S. I Love You by Jenny Han, and I love that the premise was centered around the game. I do feel like the romance developed really quickly, and I wish there would have been more build up. Also the characters are 18/19 so there definitely was more puppy love in this book. But overall, I really enjoyed it. It felt like your younger sister coming into your room, sitting on the floor, and sharing a story about what she did over the summer. 

I'd recommend if Hey Stephan is your favorite Taylor Swift song (or if Fearless is your favorite album) 

&#x200B;

**Book 2: Just Haven't Met You Yet by Sophie Cousens** 

I wanted to pick this book up since the premise sucked me in, and I loved it! But, it is a crockpot slow burn and centers around a love triangle, so it might not be for everyone. I also would categorize this as more women's/general fiction rather than solely romance. I loved the writing style and the way it talk about love, friendships, jobs, grief, life changes. If you like Josie Silver's writing, you'll love this!

v4ejly,Beach Read End Living Situations?,"(potential spoilers)

So I’ve just finished beach read, and I loved it, but I’m a little confused. As we know January was supposed to only be staying at the beach house for the summer, but since >!she and Gus got together I’m presuming she wouldn’t want to move away again to jeopardise that relationship?!< Maybe I wasn’t paying enough attention but it feels like it was never clarified where January ended up living.

uyauu3,Best novels for a beach read?,"Sun is finally here near me- craving a summer romance! 

Only requirement is that they are set in modern time (2000s-2020s). 

I have already read:
It Happened One Summer (pretty good, but a bit too many nautical/fishing themes for my taste) 
My Life Next Door
Summer I Turned Pretty series 
Summer series
Pretty much anything by Sarah Dessen (I was obsessed growing up, they were my gateway into romance!) 
The Summer of Skinny Dipping (so good, absolutely broke my heart as a teen tho- gives Bridge to Terabithia vibes) 
Seveneenth Summer 


Have I exhausted the genre? (Cries) I’m sure there’s some out there more “romance novely” as a lot of these are more YA romance, looking for the grown up versions!

m6cwhf,Not another ‘Beach Read’ thread! UGH!,"Slight spoilers below!

I know, I know... reviews of this book have been done to death, right? I’m sorry, I’m late to the party as usual. Here’s my thoughts on the book, and why it impressed the socks off of me.

This book has no business being as good as it is. It’s the romance novel for romance writers...Emily Henry told us *exactly* what she was going to do, and then did it, working in a meta-narrative where the narrator is actually showing us the inner-mechanisms of the novel’s process.

The narrator clues us in when the story comes full circle at Gus’ birthday at the end of the novel. There’s a chapter literally called “the meet cute.” The first sentence is  our narrator, January, telling us her fatal flaw, for goodness sake! 

But the writing is so smart that this vivisection of her own prose doesn’t diminish the book at all. Gus feels flashed out and “real.” January is lovable and sharp. The angst is understandable based on her parents’ marriage, and never felt forced to me.

Best of all was the banter. These two protagonists have such sharp tongues. Definitely the highlight of the book, IMHO.

The only real qualm I had at all with this book was a minor one: the author often refers to Gus as a “literary writer” a la F. Scott Fitzgerald and Steinbeck...but then, at times, she says he writes action-filled suspense novels (commonly referencing Jack Reacher and Dean Koontz, for example.) Maybe I am just splitting hairs here, but I think of Dean Koontz, James Patterson, etc. as falling squarely in the genre fiction world. Not a big deal (obviously I’m not opposed to genre fiction...) but this discrepancy confused me a bit.

In any event, this is a 5-star book in my opinion. I was spellbound, and I have to tip my hat to Emily Henry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/m6cwhf/not_another_beach_read_thread_ugh/,2021-03-16T16:24:19Z,16,47,RomanceBooks,Beach Read,POST

Also how perfect was it that their names were Augustus and January? It was definitely heavy at times but also just so beautifully written. Absolutely loved the way everything played out!

I get some of the BEST book recs from lurking on this sub so please help! I read You Deserve Each Other and LOVED IT—made me laugh and cry multiple times in the span of its pages.

j1dt92,The Honey Don’t List by Christina Lauren (for lovers of Beach Read),"I recently finished [The Honey Don’t List](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/51086670) by Christina Lauren and let me tell you.  I loved it!

Carey and James work for television’s most beloved couple, Melissa and Russell Tripp.  The Tripps are basically a fictional version of HGTV’s home design and renovation juggernauts, Chip and Joanna Gaines— they’ve got the shop, the show, the books, the magazines, the farm, and the kids.

Behind the scenes it’s not all sweetness and light, and Carey and James are given the impossible task of making sure this couple doesn’t implode during their book tour, destroying their image and ruining their chances for a second season of the Netflix special.

Of course, with all that forced proximity and shared frustration, James and Carey catch feelings.

This feels like Christina Lauren at their best— the pacing is right, the character chemistry is on point, those signature sexy steam scenes happen on page (though a little cooled off for a mainstream audience).  The conflicts aren’t contrived.  

As someone who’s seen a bazillion episodes of Fixer Upper and has a love/hate relationship with Chip and Joanna, this book made me smile and chuckle watching the Tripps rapidly devolve into chaos and dysfunction.

It was so cute!  If you liked Beach Read, you’ll like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/j1dt92/the_honey_dont_list_by_christina_lauren_for/,2020-09-28T15:12:31Z,29,64,RomanceBooks,Beach Read,POST

gnpinr,Beach Read by Emily Henry,"I'm not sure how to describe this book. It's a romcom....but it isn't. It's optimist vs grump...but it isn't. I was expecting a cute romance book... A ""Beach Read"". And it is cute. There are a lot of sweet moments, but there is so much more. 

January is a romance writer. She believes in love and rainbows and happy endings. However, after her dad dies, her life falls apart and she ends up at her father's house in his hometown in Michigan. Her new neighbor is  *gasp* her old college rival. Who not only is a writer as well, but the kind that writes Great American Literature ™. Both have writer's block, and January and Gus (the hero) decide to write a book in each other's genre. 

It's a fun premise and January voices a lot of the opinions us romance readers have. Namely, romcoms are not an ""easy"" or ""blow-off"" genre. 

But again, this isn't just a romcom. January's disbeliefs in happy endings comes after the news that her parent's perfect relationship was a lie. That her father had a second life. The house she moves into, was her father's, the one he secretly had.

January is struggling, and not just to kick start a plot, but in the gut-wrenching ache that never really goes away. 

Love doesn't save her, she has to move on and find herself on her own. Likewise, she doesn't stop Gus's trauma with love. 

Life is messy and hard and sad and sometimes you don't know what comes next. You don't know if there's a happy ending. But the journey that Emily Henry takes us on is beautiful. It's filled with the hope that comes after loss. With rich descriptions of people trying, and sometimes failing, to not let their past ruin their future. There is fun and laughs. There are tears and pain. 

I love January. You see her try to move on, but her trust in love is shattered. It takes a lot for her to start to be a person again. But, I like how she never stops trying. How she can feel the ache, but still want to be happy. 

This is the kind of book that stays with you. The message and writing style will forever stand out even after the next 50 or so romance books I will read.

ja6cwf,Multiple endings to beach read (obvious spoilers),"I have 2 different e books for Beach Read  with 2 different endings. 

 They both take place 9 months later. 

They start the same but the first one I have has Gus and January reading their books on the beach and January reads Gus’s dedication that says “to January I don’t care how the story ends as long as I spend it with you."" He then says a line about if a meteor was to hit them while they were together he would see it as going out on a high note. And she talks about how this was such a perfect “happy for now” that she didn’t have to worry about tomorrow. There is NO PROPOSAL. 

The second one (that I bought on Amazon)  starts the same way with them reading their books on the beach but then they go back to the house. He says the meteor line and then there is a surprise party and he proposes with the “I don’t care how it ends as long as I spend it with you line” and it ends with the same line about it being a perfect happy for nows. 

Am I totally crazy? Which one is the real ending? I’m guessing it’s the one I got on Amazon with the proposal is but did anyone else have the first ending with no proposal? I’m so confused lmao.

lncazv,"Contemporary romance with steamy scenes but also REAL plot? In comparison with beach read and red, white and royal blue","Thanks to the recommendations on this awesome sub I started my journey with romance books and just loved it! I read beach read and I am currently on the last pages of red, white and royal blue.

So now that I have discovered what I like in this genre I hope you have some book recs for me. I really love contemporary romances. It has to have some steamy scenes (don't have to be a lot but I want to feel the sexual tension). But what I really need is a plot besides the romance. I really enjoyed beach read but even though the romance was great I was lagging a real plot. Only a little drama with the backstory of the characters doesn't do it for me. On the other hand in red, white and royal blue I really enjoyed that the whole political thing was going on and they both have to work together against the system. (I also liked that the characters were in their twenties)

I also noticed that both authors tried to almost always have sarcastic and snarky conversations where the characters are battling over who has the wittiest and funniest responds. I DO enjoy this occasionally but I thought they were trying a little bit to hard to make it a funny read. I think I would enjoy a little bit more real emotions. (In red, white and royal blue I loved the few pages where my heart almost broke about the actions of the two characters and I was just desperate to see them together again).

We'll discuss on **7/20**\- I will post the topic around **10 am EST**. Highlight funny, thoughtful, or otherwise interesting parts to share with us, or just be ready to say what you thought!  


BTW, the next book club theme will be ""free/available on subscription"" themed, since we've had several pricier new releases lately. You can start thinking about the best free options we have available for next time!  


**Goodreads summary:**

*A romance writer who no longer believes in love and a literary writer stuck in a rut engage in a summer-long challenge that may just upend everything they believe about happily ever afters.*

*Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast.*

*They're polar opposites.*

*In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block.*

*Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She'll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he'll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously). Everyone will finish a book and no one will fall in love.

mqk2wu,"The first romance I ever read: fake relationship, walks on the beach, and make outs in the rain","Hiiiiiii

I’ve been looking for this book off and on for YEARS. I found it at one of those hotel bookshelves and covertly read it when my family was asleep when I was 15 (in 2004). I think it’s from much earlier than that though. I remember a Fabio-esque cover, I think. The only real details I remember are: 

1) h is newly (?) divorced. Her ex husband has a new relationship 

2) her neighbor (who may or may not be a firefighter?) agrees to help her make him jealous and regret leaving her, but only if she follows all of his directions. 

3) there’s a scene where they’re all at dinner and after the H reaches under her skirt to roll down the thigh highs he made her wear so they can walk barefoot on the beach. 😏

4) it’s rainy when they finally meet in the front of their houses to kiss for real

r0kc8w,"Looking for a book I read 1990s-2000s: Married woman, summering at the shore, husband stays in city during the week. She sets up a camera obscura on the beach, meets a writer & agrees to photograph him for his back-of-book photo, love affair of some sort. Possible car accident later.","I read this in the late 1990s or early 2000s. A married woman and her husband (and maybe kids?) are from the city, probably somewhere like NYC or Connecticut. They are summering somewhere like Cape Cod or Martha's Vineyard, and the husband stays in the city during the week and comes to the beach only on the weekends. The wife is into photography, whether formerly as a career before having kids, or maybe just as a hobby. She sets up a camera obscura on the beach.

She meets an author who is visiting mutual friends. They either meet at a party first, or on the beach by her camera. But they spend time talking about her camera obscura, getting to know each other, at first just a friendship forming. Since the husband is in the city during the week, the wife and the photographer can spend a lot of time together. I'm not sure if they eventually have a sexual affair, or if it's ""just"" an emotional one.

At some point he asks her to photograph his portrait for his latest book and she agrees.

This next bit I'm a bit less sure on: I think maybe they agree to not see each other again, or one of them tells the other something along the lines of ""the ball is in your court,"" and is disappointed when there's no further contact. Or maybe it was something like ""If you want to be together, meet me/come to me by such-and-such a time."" They both do want to be together, but the woman has a bad car accident (maybe even on the way to see the guy) and that's why she didn't contact him or meet him, and he thought she was ghosting him and didn't want to see him again, but she was actually recovering from her accident. When they see each other again somehow, he notices a scar (from the accident) near her hairline that she attempts to hide with her hair.

Sound familiar to anyone?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/r0kc8w/looking_for_a_book_i_read_1990s2000s_married/,2021-11-23T18:56:27Z,4,2,RomanceBooks,Beach Read,POST
z9mpu9,Second chance romance with secret child and a beach house,"I am looking for this book that I read last year I think but i can't remember the title.
It was a second chance romance. They were togheter in college and the FMC left the MMC when she finds him in bed with her roommate.
Fast forward some years later (don't remember precisely how many) they meet again for some reason and start talking/hanging out again. She had his child but she doesn't tell him immediately.
I know that this sounds super generic but I do remember that at some point they went to a beach house together.
I also remember a scene where they went to a restaurant. In the bathroom she runs into her former roommate who is now pregnant and she confess that she didn't actually slept with the MMC, but tried to seduce him but he passed out drunk.

z1ei4z,Blackbird Beach Series (+ story vs reality),"I started reading the 8-book [Blackbird Beach series](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TBCMK2Y?binding=kindle_edition&ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tukn) by Maggie Miller and am enjoying it immensely. Normally, I detest serialized stories, but all 8 books have been published, so I can binge the entire thing.  And it’s really an all or nothing set - each book picks up where the previous ended.

It’s the story of Georgia Carpenter (mid-50’s, divorce in process from scummy cheating husband) and her family as she starts a new life after inheriting a long-neglected property called the Sea Glass Inn.  Early in the series, her adult children, Mia and Griffin (27), each join her as major life events take them off track.   So it’s not the typical romance as there are multiple relationships slowly unfolding. 

I’m really enjoying the writing and plan to check out what else the author has written.

However, aside from that, I’m skeptical about the PLAUSIBILITY of this inn supporting all the characters.  It’s a 6 bedroom beachside inn along with a small 2-bedroom cottage rental.  This is set in a small coastal town - charming but not a tourist area. 

Ultimately, they need to support salaries for inn owner (Georgia), inn manager (Mia), full-time handyman, part time chef, housekeeper/cleaning staff (initially 1, but later 1.5 or 2).  The adult son (single parent to a baby) is also involved and will be running some water sports activities while developing a side business of photography. Especially with a baby in the mix, I can’t help but wonder what they all do for insurance.

I’m willing to push that aside and continue enjoying the story.  But it just seems like a lot of people to support.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/z1ei4z/blackbird_beach_series_story_vs_reality/,2022-11-21T23:54:29Z,1,7,RomanceBooks,Beach Read,POST

I read the first chapters of a book (Romcom) contemporary because it was just the preview but never found it again.

Later when her friend arrives and goes directly to him when she sees him because she’s actually a fan he realizes the other girl had no clue of who he was… he ends up asking her out she refuses because I remember she mentioned something about just breaking up and her ex was also a hockey star or famous too but he insists.

z5qe96,Looking for the title of a book about a woman who washes up on a beach and is found by identical twins- ends up with both brothers.,"I have been going crazy trying to remember this book- I've searched my Amazon history and cannot find it. I read it sometime between 2011 and 2019 (probably earlier than 2019).

This is a contemporary / suspense romance that is a part of a series about a wealth family. The brothers are reclusive and one twin is agoraphobic (or something similar) while the other one is able to go out into society. The more 'normal' twin was the one to bring women home and the brothers would switch off  / share since they're identical.  

A woman washes up on their private island / beach.  The setting is northern, not tropical.  During her recovery (I think she might have amnesia- know later in the story we find out that she washed up on shore either trying to escape her ex or because he tried to kill her at sea) the brothers start to fall for her. Both brothers start to have separate relationships with their 'guest' . She doesn't realize at first that she is sleeping with two different men. Eventually, their ruse is up, and she is fine with being with both brothers.

After they get the relationship straightened out, the story is about saving the heroine from the evil ex. 

Other information: This is a part of a series. One of the books has a female cousin (who does a call back to the twins' happy relationship with the heroine in another book(s)). I also believe that there is a successful artist in the book or series. I think the artist might be the acrophobic brother, but I could be mixing up story lines.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/z5qe96/looking_for_the_title_of_a_book_about_a_woman_who/,2022-11-27T03:31:40Z,4,20,RomanceBooks,Beach Read,POST

15mkar4,"I just finished Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston and I didn't love it","This book was **AGGRESSIVELY** American, which is perfectly fine, there's nothing wrong with that. However, as a non-American reader, it got to be a little much sometimes.

\-The Americanness: there were SO. MANY. GODDAMN. ACRONYMS. I feel like, if they're going to sell this book outside of the US, it should come with an acronym encyclopedia. It came to a point where I just stopped bothering to look up LSAT and FSOTUS and NST and this and that and that.

\-The Politics: definitely way too much. The last two chapters of the book were an absolute slog to get through. Not only did I not understand half of what the characters were talking about, but there was almost no romance, other than a couple kisses here and there. Just politics.

\-Gary Stu: Alex, at least in the first half of the book, was a complete Gary Stu and it almost turned me off from the second half. I physically cringed when everyone stood in ovation at him giving a graduation speech or asking for pictures even though they didn't know him because he was Summa Cum Laude. Let me tell you, as someone that did get Summa Cum Laude irl, that does not happen. Obviously. There are a lot more examples, but I don't feel like going through them now.

\-Hilarious: I said a few bad things, but, honestly, the book was hilarious. There were some moments and exchanges that made me laugh out loud. Really good humor.

\-Henry: I loved the Prince and wish we could've had more of him. I thought the story would be split between both of their POV's. I was definitely left wanting more Prince Charming.

I would give the book a 3/5. There was way too much politics and not enough romance. Again, nothing wrong with the book focusing so hard on American politics, but I wish I would've known that before I bought it. It might just be that I'm not super into YA anymore, and I had just finished a VERY intense book before I started this one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/15mkar4/i_just_finished_red_white_royal_blue_by_casey/,2023-08-09T16:36:12Z,77,105,RomanceBooks,"Red, White & Royal Blue",POST

h9ncm8,"Red, White, & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston","Welcome to another installment of 🎉Drag🎉Your🎉Favorites🎉, the review series where we talk about The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of /r/romancebooks popular titles.

&#x200B;

It’s Pride month.  Just yesterday SCOTUS just issued a ruling that bars LGBTQ discrimination in the workplace, and June 26 is the 5th anniversary of the SCOTUS ruling recognizing same-sex marriage as a right in the US.  I’m tired of waiting to talk to y’all about this, so today I’m dragging [Red, White, & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250316776).

&#x200B;

^(Fine Print: This is not an Official Thing. There will be spoilers.  I have used spoiler tags wherever possible, but those things are incredibly fickle so proceed at your own risk.)

&#x200B;

**The Good**

It was funny.  Alex, especially, made me laugh, but all the characters were funny.  Even Ellen Claremont had her humorous moments.  The White House Trio were always riffing off each other’s jokes and it gave this book such a light-hearted feel from the very start.

&#x200B;

In fact, the friendship between The White House trio immediately drew me into this book.  At one point, McQuiston says Alex “knows them both down to their split ends and nasty habits, but there’s a strange girl bond between them he can’t, and knows he isn’t supposed to, translate.”  What an amazing description of close female friendship and maybe friendship in general; it’s a thing that can’t be captured, it can’t be quantified, and often times it can’t be deciphered unless you’re part of it.

&#x200B;

The way Alex and Henry express their love and affection for each other had me totally swooning.   >!Their late night phone calls and facetimes, constant texting, and their eventual email exchanges were so loving.  Their exchanges of historical love letters was especially sweet.  Henry send Alex a letter that Alexander Hamilton sent to Eliza: “You engross my thoughts too intirely \\\[sic\\\] to allow me to think of anything else—you not only employ my mind all day; but you intrude upon my sleep.  I meet you in every dream—and when I wake I cannot close my eyes again for ruminating on your sweetness.!<  I thought I would melt reading all of that.  If I ever, in my life, get a love letter like that, I will die of happiness.

&#x200B;

There was a lot of timely racial commentary here.  Alex and Henry >!are shoved into the custodian’s closet at the hospital, where they!< sort of argue about the difficulties of their roles as children of world leaders.  Alex talks about being the Mexican son of a white woman, how he can’t pass for white, and because of that he will always be treated differently and more harshly than someone else in his position.  And, as we are all talking about now, race is an incredibly important part of how we perceive people and white privilege is a very real thing.  This idea is underscored by Los Bastardos, Mexican men in the senate who see themselves as rebels disrupting a system of white supremacy (they are), and doing it all while believing a large part of America doesn’t want them there (it doesn’t).  McQuiston addresses racial politics obliquely, as well, when >!after the romantic Henry and Alex photos and emails leak, !< the republican opponent tries to use family values as a way to disparage President Claremont and her campaign, saying they have violated the “sacred grounds of the house our forefathers built.”  Senator Diaz responds by pointing out that the White House was built by slaves, not the forefathers, a significant correction that many Americans fail to acknowledge.

&#x200B;

In fact, McQuistion uses Alex to grapple with a lot of thorny issues that America is facing right now.  >!Alex lays his campaign coworker out over the issues of racial and sexuality that intersect with voter suppression—he says, “You don’t get to sit up here and pretend like it’s someone else’s problem.  None of us do."" !< Preach, Alex.

&#x200B;

McQuiston gives the readers a chance to explore sexuality  >!as Alex is trying to figure out what’s happening between him and Henry and begins questioning his experiences and sexual responses to boys after Henry kisses him in the garden!<. We’re left concluding, with Alex, that sexuality exists on a spectrum and is very often fluid; many of us don’t simply fall on one side or the other.  She made that very clear in her cast of characters; there was quite a lot of non-cis/het representation.   >!Amy was trans and gay, her wife was pansexual, Luna was gay, Nora was bi, Alex was bi, Henry was gay, June and Pezza seemed to be not totally straight themselves.!<

&#x200B;

The New Year’s Eve party at the White House was amazing.  And the wild night out in LA.  Just the way McQuiston describes Alex and Henry when they get to be together, completely besotted and full of wanting.  It was excellent.  Their whole arc of falling in love.  All of it.

&#x200B;

Among all that, McQuiston gives us the chance to imagine a different America.  The one we hoped for in 2016; the one we’re hoping for in 2020.  Even in fiction, even in the face of bigotry and hatred and evil, we get the opportunity to experience the kind of America we want for ourselves.  That was powerful for me as a reader.

&#x200B;

**The Bad**

There were a lot of pop culture references in this book.  Like, a whole lot.  The way Alex, June, and Nora talked was especially “millennial.”  I’m not necessarily mad about all the Harry Potter references.  But, while it’s extremely relatable now, I’m thinking this kind of thing will date the book in years to come.

&#x200B;

The inner political workings were very dry; reading about policy and nominations and endorsements and more specific aspects of campaigns in the context of a fiction novel was a slog for me.  It did lend realism to plot and characters—Alex is a political junkie and if we’re gonna believe that, there needs to be political junkie aspects to his personality.  But I thought they were boring to read.

&#x200B;

I sort of questioned McQuiston’s experience with the regions where the book takes place.  Alex is from Texas but he is a lacrosse champion.  Football is life down there.  I grew up there; I’d never even heard of lacrosse before moving east; shit, soccer wasn’t even that common.  So I questioned Alex’s lacrosse trophies.  Now, look.  I know Texas is a big state.  But there were other things that didn’t quite add up, either.  Like them drinking Mexican Coke over Dr. Pepper.  Again, as a native Texan, I questioned that.  Honestly, I have only ever heard non-Texans talk about Mexican Coke.  And then Alex talked about his homecoming corsage but there was no mention of the mums, which is a HUGE deal at homecoming in Texas.  The Claremont-Diaz family did come from a community further south than mine, and I grew up extremely rural, so perhaps we can chalk those up to regional differences.  But it did pull me out of the narrative.

&#x200B;

But then she had it snow on Christmas in Washington, D.C.  That’s incredibly rare.  It just doesn’t happen.  I think the last time there was snow on Christmas, it was like ten years ago.  And then for the snow to stick around until New Year’s?  I dunno.  Stupid, probably, but I questioned that.

&#x200B;

**The Ugly**

Trump won the 2016 general and is our current President, Not Ellen Claremont.  I think that’s pretty ugly.  Feel free to @ me.

&#x200B;

The epistolary aspects of this novel bothered me.  Not so much reading the texts or emails, but the other stuff was so tedious.  Like the tweets and the podcast transcripts.  Very tedious to read through that crap.  I know that McQuiston was likely going for timeliness—in today’s world all of these aspects of communication are important—but there had to be another way to maintain realism and for us to get that information.

I can’t decide how hard McQuiston was trying to mimic the political dramas that came with the 2016 Presidential election.  The issues with the >!emails being leaked and the private email server!< for example felt extremely on the nose.  But I was happy when she referred to the republican opponent as Sam the Eagle, because that’s how I refer to Pence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/h9ncm8/red_white_royal_blue_by_casey_mcquiston/,2020-06-15T19:44:20Z,78,64,RomanceBooks,"Red, White & Royal Blue",POST

I’ve been sitting here reading this like a giggly goofyball, and it does not look pretty.

Why is this book so fucking sweet and adorable and dare I say wholesome? 😭 

And here I am taking a break and make a thread to avoid getting misty eyed during this *one* part that has *not* made me smile like a dumb fool this whole time. >!The part where they make love after saying their I-love-you’s and they’re both teary-eyed because it’s “goodbye sex.” God does forbidden love pull at my heartstrings.!<

Other than that, my insides are a big, warm puddle of goo right now. 

I mean it’s not even like this book is extraordinary or spectacular or epic in any way. But damn I don’t remember how many romances it’s been since I’ve felt *this* warm and fuzzy inside. 

Is it because it’s my first proper M/M?

il6ngm,"Perfectly Impossible: Red, White & Royal Blue","***Warnings for some talk about politics. My commentary is critical of the book’s utopian political vision, which I argue is part of its view on an “ideal” world in which such a romantic plot would be possible, and is therefore fair game, though I fully acknowledge the book is not trying to be “realistic” in any way. Spoilers ahead for the entire thing. There are brief mentions of being outed against one’s will and a sexual abuse plotline.***

Casey McQuiston’s 2019 novel *Red, White &*  *Royal Blue* is obviously not meant to be a serious commentary on the current political state of affairs in the U.S.A. It is over-the-top outlandish wish-fulfillment for a person of a certain political stripe. If you are not super-duper lefty, this book is decidedly not for you, and you’ve probably given it a pass. I am super-duper lefty, but the only reason I mention this is that while I’m not American, which understandably makes this book less “for me,” this book is intended to speak to people like me, who think the way I do about certain social issues. I’m not going to hate on it because it assumes everyone reading shares its leftist and progressive ideals. At the same time, I feel weirdly curmudgeonly being critical of it in any way as it is so unabashedly a fantasy. Any dislike of its candy-coloured utopian alternate timeline is, arguably, beside the point, as this is a romance, not a realistic political drama.

I’ll give you a taste of the book’s flavour with a bit of a summary which goes on too long because it’s rather fun to summarize. This novel starts with Henry, Prince of Wales, and Alex, the son of the American President, who hate each other for no good reason, getting into a tiff at a royal wedding of the prince’s brother. Of course, they wind up somehow falling into the very expensive royal wedding cake, Alex hauling down Henry until they land in a pile of icing sugar and wasted taxpayer dollars. It continues with the two of them being forced into a “no, we’re really best friends, not mortal enemies” joint PR tour of the UK, in which they appear on morning shows and make sure to arrange a photocall afterwards. During these plot machinations, while visiting sick children in the hospital, the Prince and the FSOTUS escape a (false) gun threat by being shoved into a hospital broom closet, a gesture whose symbolism is not lost on either character.

However, before they can get together, Alex must first realize he’s bisexual, after Prince Henry confesses to his crush on Alex, then kisses him during a party. Alex finally figures out why he is so into the idea of that, having never set aside the time to consider his sexuality before – a part of the novel I loved. Chapters later, having both definitively exited that literal and metaphorical closet, they are kissing wildly against a portrait of Alexander Hamilton in the White House. The couple’s secret relationship develops during night out at the karaoke bar, which Alex and Henry attend with their best friends and favourite siblings. Everyone wears matching silk kimonos with customized embroidery featuring cheeky names for each member of the group. The narrative gaze lingers on happy montages of beautiful, successful queer British and American millennial/gen-Zers photogenically flirting with each other and having a grand, carefree time, not worried about a pandemic, paying their rents, civil rights protests or domestic terrorists attacking those civil rights protestors. Henry, who is rather shy, drinks enough liquid courage to belt out “Don’t Stop Me Now” at the mic. Alex, not shy at all, hauls him off to the bathroom for some private fun as a reward.

The book contains a scene where Alex storms over to Buckingham Palace after purchasing a first-class plane ticket on his own dime, after being ghosted by Henry, who can’t deal with Alex’s overtures towards commitment. Given his role as the spare to the throne, his life is supposed to involve churning out heterosexual babies with a nice member of the nobility, which would preclude a relationship with Alex, whom he never expected to seriously like him enough for that kind of commitment. Alex, despite being on the “do not admit” blacklist post-breakup, negotiates his way into the princely apartments with the help of a savvy security staffer with an inside connection: her fiancé is on Henry's security detail. Once he’s busted past the guards, Alex declares his undying love for Prince Henry and throws himself at his feet. Of course, it works, because this book’s sensibility is firmly in Hollywood, not the territory of a British rom-com. According to its logic, since Henry is a classically English repressed sort of man, his tender heart wants nothing more than an American grand gesture of affection. And it got me, it really did; I mean, all these concocted scenes, which are not trying to be anything but indulgent fun and are certainly a distraction from pandemics, civil rights protests and domestic terrorism. How can a person of a certain political stripe *possibly* dislike a single thing about a story like that? What kind of pitiless, mean-spirited monster would one be to do so?

More than this, how can anyone hate the book’s treacly ambitions? Because that is what it aspiring to be: a confection, and one concocted by a very masterful pastry chef, at that, whose every writing decision seems so clever and deliberate it cannot be doubted that if this wanted to be some *other* sort of book about an intercontinental political love-affair, you’d be reading that instead, and it WOULD still be an NYT bestseller. This is a story about optimism in politics, as much as it is about a romantic relationship. It is a moral fable in which hard work is rewarded, politicians possess virtue alongside hustle, and the public can be trusted to make the right decision on both presidential elections and whether they should celebrate high-profile gay relationships between the children of heads of state (and ceremonial figureheads). It’s a book in which a politician’s private email server leaks are honestly no big deal and have no effect on the upcoming election. The politician who leaks a rival’s emails in response to the initial hacking is not motivated by pure greed and selfishness. He wants to achieve a greater political good by bringing down a corrupt candidate who sexually abused and tried to blackmail him, possibly sacrificing his own career in the process.

It is also a book in which un-politically correct opinions, like the ones voiced by a WASPy Dem staffer, that certain red states are too far-gone to be worth courting by the Democrats; or the opinions voiced by the highly fictionalized queen of England, that the majority of the public will not support gay rights now or ever, are definitively trounced and proven wrong. This feels a bit like grandstanding a position on the right side of history, as much as I agree with those sentiments. At the novel’s conclusion, the left wins the political and the culture war. There is kissing and celebration. History is made: a tagline of the lover’s hacked emails, in which Alex compares his relationship with Henry to other famous historical gay love-affairs, is enshrined on a popular T-shirt, with the slogan, “History, huh?” Everyone waves around their pansexual-flag-embroidered jean-jackets in glee and no one is murdered while they are out peacefully protesting.

So why do I feel so let-down and bitter by that aspect of the book, as though I have just binged a box of chocolates and been left with a tremendous sugar headache?  Because, damn, at certain points, this was some of the best sugary chocolate I have ever eaten, so it was definitely worth it, but we’ll return to that later. Why does presenting common decency and morality in a context that is deliberately fantastical and purely leftist seem so disheartening? Why do I feel such disappointment that most of the side characters - the women president, the hero’s sister, and his best friend - three women who are brilliant at their jobs and endlessly supportive of the hero, seem like little more than author mouthpieces for clever wisecracks and correct decisions that fall on the right side of history, and not actual people? Why does it frustrate me so much that these women can do no wrong and make not a single mistake, as though they might be less worthy of rooting for if they dared to be imperfect?

The tacit assumption of the book is that the entire political process of elections in the States, a bloated and yearslong endeavour that consumes billions of dollars and results in a dysfunctional political system that can’t manage to return people’s money to public benefits, is intrinsically right and good. The election swallows an entire year of White House political energy in this novel. It is the first thought on Alex’s mind at every moment when he’s not thinking of his love for Henry or his future career. Domestic politics aren’t mentioned once, and no one seems to have a problem with that. I mean, if you are this invested in the system, of *course,* you want that personal and organizational cost to pay off with success because otherwise, it is a colossal waste of resources. Slow blink; stare off into the distance, *sigh*.

I listen to *Pod Save America* more often than I have any business doing as a non-national. From the perspective of political organizers, I know that this kind of investment of time and money is simply what American politics demands in its current form. One cannot even reshape that system without being immersed within it, paying the price and accepting the cost at every level of meaning for that term, so it’s not as though I’m unsympathetic to the realities of being a politician in the USA. It’s not as though I literally want this novel to be about the USA completely overhauling its political system to become Sweden, as that would be beyond the scope of any novel where politics are not at the very center of things. But even so, the limits of this novel’s idealism made me shake my head at actual problems too great to be handwaved away in an escapist flight of fancy. Just as normalized as the accepted path to political success is the idea, in this book, that the first son and daughter of the president naturally become celebrities and nepotistically fill public roles within the administration. This is a reality that has garnered no small amount of critique for a family on the other side of the political aisle. I think such nepotism is wrong in any circumstance, for the record. But is it even fair to be upset that the imagination of this book doesn’t extend far enough to question certain assumptions about the ideal political outcome? Is it not too much to demand of a work of fiction which does not pretend, for a moment, to be real, or that its goal is anything other than a “deserving heroes” AU within an existing political framework?

Even so, are the heroes *entirely* deserving? How do we hear so much about Alex wanting to help people by being a politician, but are given zero examples of him actually helping people through political action, for instance? Alex doesn’t HAVE to go have some manufactured encounter where he helps a troubled youth through a government-sponsored outreach program, or something, just to convince me, Ms. Canadian Crankpyants without a dog in this fight, that he’s a good person and not just in the political game for the sake of his vanity, as I would argue he seems to be on occasion. At the conclusion of the novel, Alex’s sister June sells a memoir to a publisher. Does a mid-twenties daughter of a politician really have enough life experience to merit writing a memoir, and is it fair that the memoir is primarily going to be read by people interested in her mom’s politics, and does celebrating this not seem to cheerfully reinforce our present reality where power, wealth and privilege simply beget more generational power, wealth and privilege and opportunities for personal advancement?

You get the idea. My critique boils down to, “Instead of becoming pure escapist fantasy, the specific ways in which it is congruent and incongruent with reality dragged me down.” Which is quite personal, and certainly not a widely shared opinion, as many people adored this book’s escapism. The author, in the postscript, has indicated that this is how she wanted to serve the people who are working so hard in public service: by giving them a fantastical alternate world to mitigate the sting of the present one, the sort of world she’d want to live in herself. This is arguably an act of humility, not hubris, creating a better imaginary world to soothe those people for whom reality is presently an unbearable burden. “It’s just not for you,” you might rightly say, and I cannot disagree.

But parts of this novel are SO very much for me that it isn’t accurate to say it simply wasn’t for me. The letters the guys exchange, for example -  Oh God, the letters are everything. The newspaper and groupchat epistolary elements were [not Canquilt’s favourite](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/h9ncm8/red_white_royal_blue_by_casey_mcquiston/) in her 🎉DYF🎉 review, though she did enjoy the emails, so your mileage may vary.  I just love the feeling that we’re peering over someone’s shoulder when letters are included; that we’re reading about the protagonists’ heart’s desires, their secret selves they keep hidden from the world and only revealed to the person they love most. This novel’s third act sees the pair of young lovers breathlessly exchanging over-the-top romantic emails footnoted with historical quotations from real gay love affairs. In these letters, when they aren’t flexing their knowledge of, for example, composers of the Romantic movement, as they are wont do in person, they explain their affection for each other through invented fairytales and landscape allegories. There seems to be no metaphor bold enough to convey their passions. Alex writes to Henry: “*On the map of you, my fingers can always find the green hills, wales, cool waters and a shore of white chalk. The ancient part of you carved out of stone in a prayerful circle, sacrosanct. Your spine’s a ridge I’d die climbing.”* (447) Now I’m sighing and staring off into the distance for quite different reasons.

A frequently mentioned critique of this book is that it has a tendency towards try-hard-ness with its quippy cleverness. I mean, here is how Alex’s best friend Nora describes her outfit for one event: ""*i’m going for, like, depressed lesbian poet who met a hot yoga instructor at a speakeasy who got her super into meditation and pottery, and now she’s starting a new life as a high-powered businesswoman selling her own line of hand-thrown fruit bowls.""* (212)

Yeesh. The conversations often have this air of people showing off for each other, used to perennially auditioning their smarts for an audience, almost anticipating their screencaps are going to get posted to a subreddit or popular Instagram page. This book has no chill in that regard. Someone’s almost always being impossibly, performatively clever to someone else. Says the President, after the Alex-and-Henry falling into the cake scandal: *“As your mother, I can appreciate that maybe this isn’t your fault, but as the president, all I want is to have the CIA fake your death and ride the dead-kid sympathy into a second term.” (37)*

Yet in the epistolary portion of the narrative, that over-the-top effort just works. Where the tone could be snarky before, here it is unabashedly earnest and tender. Besides, love-letters are *supposed* to be a combination of try-hard and earnest, which you know the other party will not judge you for your indulgences, for your craziest hyperbole and your wildest flights of fancy, because they are so madly in love they’ll forgive anything. The love letters in the novel become a layer cake with another layer cake on top and extra maraschino cherries drowned in heaps of whipped cream, and I wanted to drown *myself* in them, reveling in vicarious happiness all the way down.

“*I thought, this is the most incredible thing I have ever seen* \[meaning seeing Alex for the first time\]” writes Henry, of the moment he fell in love with Alex – at first sight, of course, when they were both teenagers. “*And I had better keep it a safe distance away from me. I thought, if someone like that ever loved me, it would set me on fire. And then I was a careless fool, and I fell in love with you anyway.” (300)*

Says Alex, describing his love for Henry after having a bit too much whiskey: “*there’s a corner of your mouth, and a place that it goes. Pinched and worried like you’re afraid you’re forgetting something. I used to hate it. used to think it was your little tic of disapproval. but I’ve kissed your mouth, that corner, that place it goes, so many times now. I’ve memorized it. topography on the map of you, a world I’m still charting. I know it. I added it to the key, here: inches to miles. I can multiply it out, read your latitude and longitude, recite your coordinates like la rosaria.” (319)*

In the tradition of sixteenth-century explorers charting the new world, and maybe a bit of winking reverse imperialism for the country that gave America its language and staked its own claim there, Alex tells Henry that the topography of his body is as sacred to him as the key he wears next to his heart, the key to his family home. He’s saying that he holds this quirk of Henry’s physical self, that twitch of his mouth, that once meant one thing to him and is now revealed to be quite another expression of sentiment, as a token of that private persona only a lover knows.  He has memorized it with all the fervour of religious prayer, recalling the metrics of Henry’s body as though he can summon him back, translate him over this impossible physical and cultural distance that separates them. It’s so beautiful and thoughtful. I have rarely read another romance novel in which the vulnerable passion of first love is so fearlessly written. For that alone, the entire book is worth it. Those are the scenes to which I’ll be returning when I reread it. Because yes, as much as the political assumptions bothered me, the love story was *that* wonderful.

On that try-hard-ness I mentioned earlier, though…Here I am, utterly a hypocrite, because I am someone who writes three thousand words over-intellectualizing erotica and now some weirdly personal, nitpicky hit piece on a gay prince/American royalty escapist fantasy. And shouldn’t we be *celebrating* a writer who takes such pains to make everything in her fluffy, cotton-candy-book bright and sparkling and shiny, as clever as can be, and as thoughtful as is humanly possible, who admits in her acknowledgments that she pruned 40,000 words from the draft at one point and cites her genuinely impressive research into gay history archives?

But there is nothing about this book that is not striving for something, striving for the perfect one-liner, or the perfect post-collegiate path to success for a first daughter with writerly aspirations, or the perfect near-miss yet plausible-recovery re-election story for the incumbent president. It even attempts to mitigate some of the darker territory the book skims over by, well, this sort of lampshade hanging, in which it’s acknowledged that things historically have been awful but, y’know, not above poking fun at:

*“Listen,” Alex tells her* \[his sister June, before the royal wedding commences\] “royal weddings are trash, the princes who have royal weddings are trash, the imperialism that allows princes to exist at all is trash. It’s trash turtles all the way down.”

*“Is this your TED Talk?” June asks. “You do realize America is genocidal empire too, right?” (20)*

Genocidal empire lol let’s go try on some totally edgy bomber jacket for Mom’s big political moment and never mention colonialism again! I mean…I understand not wanting to make a romance book about reckoning with the actual legacy of genocidal empires, but I do question whether being quite so blasé about things that are terrible isn’t a bit too flippant.

McQuiston goes heavy on a Protestant qua late-capitalist idea of virtue through perpetual hustle, in which it’s praiseworthy to sleep at your desk and drink to cope with your stress and postpone any self-reflection about your sexual identity that might be painful because who even has the time for that (a portion of the novel I found frighteningly relatable, for the record) and to eat junk food for dinner and have a nervous breakdown the moment you stop spinning in the endless toil of to-do-lists and career ladder climbing. It all becomes more than a little exhausting, even for purportedly escapist fun. Interesting, isn’t it, that work-life balance has no part in the fantasy of the ideal political landscape, that every single character is a nose-to-the-grindstone hustler who won’t quit and has no idea what to do with themselves when their workload is diminished. Alex, when he’s fired from his mom’s campaign as a political liability once his love-affair is outed, basically goes on long runs, freaks out a lot, and lets angst spur him to take the LSAT, lest we think, for a single minute, that he’s some kind of lazy fuck-up for not maximizing his downtime. That might make him…a bad person!

I don’t want this to just be one long bitch-session about how certain parts of the book didn’t work for me sandwiched around an enthusiastic rave for the portion that did. And really, McQuiston is so funny and clever and thoughtful in her work that I am certainly interested in whatever she does next. I am fairly confident the problems I have with this specific novel would be almost impossible to replicate in any other context and I’ll probably love her next one.

But I think what was missing, for me personally, was this idea of the worthwhile struggle, of really suffering for a cause that is worth it. Don’t get me wrong – both Alex and Henry DO suffer for their identity, and the cost of being honest means having their names and their relationship dragged through the press after it is outed against their wills, which is a legitimately terrifying prospect. And the idea that gay people need to be shown as suffering for who they are is a tired one; completely overdone. We don’t need more fictional gay suffering whatsoever. But I think we do need an aspirational world in which the everyday imperfections of others and ourselves  – when people voice ideas we don’t agree with, when we undertake the occasional selfish action we have not considered fully enough, when we may fail to succeed – are accommodated in a visionary ideal reality, a place where goodness and morality are apolitical. Where politics are other than press optics; where meaning is found beyond PR appearances, where failure to achieve a goal is a more profound teacher than success. I would like an ideal escapist world to seem not quite so impossible to imagine as real, because it is populated by imperfect people who resemble ourselves, who we root for to succeed, and who we still have sympathy for when they don’t. Even in a romance novel. Especially for these two lead characters, who felt so real to me except for their unreal, idealized world.

All that said, this is a decade-defining novel, and we’re going to be talking about it for years to come. You should definitely read it, and you should definitely rave to me about how much you loved it if you did. If there’s one thing I love, it’s when people love something so much that they persuade me to change my mind and fall in love with it; to see that smirky humour in a way I’ve never considered before, until I’m writing love-letters to it myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/il6ngm/perfectly_impossible_red_white_royal_blue/,2020-09-02T13:20:47Z,30,36,RomanceBooks,"Red, White & Royal Blue",POST

Henry was adorable from the beginning until the last page. He reminds me of one of my three musketeers (Z, Q and B, who are in my flair). How can a MMC be so adorable? I felt his pain and his loneliness.

RWRB is an enemies to lovers story about the First Son of the President and the Prince of England. It’s funny, made me laugh out loud multiple times, charming, with just the right amount of cheesiness, and there is an adorable HEA. It needs more love, stat.

Maybe I’m the ideal demographic for this audience: polysci degree, part of the lgbtq+ community, romance reader who needs some escapism from time to time. But this book is motherfucking delightful (and will give you some well-timed spice now and then) and if only I could figure out which friend I let borrow my copy I will read it over and over.

115s4bk,"Books where characters get together quick like Red, White and Royal Blue","I just finished RWRB, I know I’m like soooooo late to the game. I hesitated at first because I wasn’t sure I would be into an MM romance. But oh my god. I love this book so much. So much so that I went and bought a physical copy when I was forced to return my Libby library loan. 

I’m looking for recommendations for similar books where the characters just love each other so hard and it’s so swoony and so oooshy gooshy. I feel like the plot of most romance books is will they/won’t they, and we don’t get the feels until the final climatic scene. I loved this book so much for the relationship between these two, from pretty early on. The texts! The emails! 😍

Any books like that? Like swoony the whole time. Not just at the last chapter.

Basically, the son of the first female US president falls in love with a prince of England. It’s enemies to friends to lovers, and I’m obsessed with the everything about it—the writing, the situation, the humour, the romance, the political manoeuvrings, all the characters—I could go on and on. 

It’s low angst and low conflict between the two MCs, all things considered, but it’s still very moving in places. It made me laugh quite often, but there were also a couple places that made me cry. 

Pretty sure there are a lot of thorough reviews of it here already, but I just thought I’d remind you all of its existence.

lncazv,"Contemporary romance with steamy scenes but also REAL plot? In comparison with beach read and red, white and royal blue","Thanks to the recommendations on this awesome sub I started my journey with romance books and just loved it! I read beach read and I am currently on the last pages of red, white and royal blue.

So now that I have discovered what I like in this genre I hope you have some book recs for me. I really love contemporary romances. It has to have some steamy scenes (don't have to be a lot but I want to feel the sexual tension). But what I really need is a plot besides the romance. I really enjoyed beach read but even though the romance was great I was lagging a real plot. Only a little drama with the backstory of the characters doesn't do it for me. On the other hand in red, white and royal blue I really enjoyed that the whole political thing was going on and they both have to work together against the system. (I also liked that the characters were in their twenties)

I also noticed that both authors tried to almost always have sarcastic and snarky conversations where the characters are battling over who has the wittiest and funniest responds. I DO enjoy this occasionally but I thought they were trying a little bit to hard to make it a funny read. I think I would enjoy a little bit more real emotions. (In red, white and royal blue I loved the few pages where my heart almost broke about the actions of the two characters and I was just desperate to see them together again).

le5b7e,"I'm going to talk about how much I LOOOVED side characters in Red, White and Royal Blue","I just finally read **Red, White, and Royal Blue** and **loved it**. I had a weird hype - counter-hype thing going in in that I had heard about it from this sub largely in the form of skimming some ""this is hyped and for various reasons didn't totally work for me"" comments and posts (which I now have read, do understand, and am interested to have further discussions on the book in general). That, combined with the fact that M/M is a sometimes food for me meant that I came in reading a book that felt important to read to be part of the discussion, but not necessarily something I would love. But it blew way past those expectations for me.

I want to focus on what an amazing job Casey McQuiston does with side characters.

It's obvious that the romcom is having its moment in contemporary romance. I actually have a kind of complicated relationship with the film genre of the romantic comedy, but one thing I feel strongly about is that film romantic comedies live or die on their side characters. Carrie Fisher in **When Harry Met Sally,** Rupert Everett in **My Best Friend's Wedding^(1)**, or to go old school, Ruth Hussey in **The Philadelphia Story**. These movies would not at all be the same without this support. To me, the most effective romantic comedies are *ensembles*, and that makes it a tricky genre to import into the tight world of romances, which are often almost monofocused (bifocused?) on the two leads

**Red, White, and Royal Blue** gives us these little bits of characters and gives us *just enough* about them to see that they are living their own full lives that Alex is just kind of pinballing past, just barely aware of.  I think this ties into another genre the book fits into -- New Adult. When we are in our early 20s, we are just starting to learn that everyone around us has as complex and involved a life story as we do. One thing that fiction focused on this age group can do is use glimpses to show us as the audience that everyone around the main character is the hero of their own story, even as the main character doesn't fully grasp that.

I think the best example is Liam, Alex's old friend. Alex is a guy who thinks of himself as straight in spite of some pretty significant sexual experimentation with Liam. We get a couple of offhand mentions of Liam -- enough to know that Alex still names him when asked if he has any friends outside his tight trio of his sister and her best friend/Alex's ex Nora, but also that those two call him out on the fact that he hasn't interacted with Liam in literally over a year.

But then in the course of the book, Alex is having a bisexual awakening and calls Liam out of the blue to be like ""uh hey, when we two dudes did sex stuff together, was that gay?""

And in the course of that phone call, as the audience we get enough to see that while to *Alex*, Liam is his best friend that he watched porn with sometimes like guys do right? right?, to *Liam*, Alex is the ""straight"" guy who kept him on a string for years and that Liam is *just now* getting over. I'm not sure Alex totally gets it even by the end of the book, but it's clear that there's a whole romance novel about Liam getting over Alex and finding a new relationship. And we get enough to fill in those blanks with like three pages of actual text!

There's maybe a half-dozen of these characters that we never *see* the full story of, but we get enough to see that it's there. There's Zahra and Shaan. There's Bea. You can see the ways in which Alex is a major side character in *their* stories, not just the other way around.

And in addition to this vibrancy they lend, there's the humor. I don't think I've ever said ""I died"" about a media scene, but when Alex's mom breaks out the *PowerPoint* I fucking died. For being the president in a political novel her role is relatively small, but it delivers the funny when it needs to.

**R,W,&RB** is obviously a book that does some worldbuilding in constructing it's familiar-but-different alternate universe. But maybe it's greatest work of worldbuilding is surrounding its protagonist with people who don't act like they are minor characters but rather like people with 99 problems and the main character of the novel is just one.

1. There's a real discussion to be had about whether this character was so great for Rupert Everett or gay representation, but his role unquestionably does a lot of good for the *movie*.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/le5b7e/im_going_to_talk_about_how_much_i_loooved_side/,2021-02-06T19:52:52Z,5,49,RomanceBooks,"Red, White & Royal Blue",POST

mtahd2,"""Red-Hot Ranchman"" by Victoria Pade: a Book Report for the Class","Um… hi. So, I know we were supposed to have our book reports ready on books that we like or hot new releases or books written this millennium, but I… I didn’t understand the assignment. I’m sorry, I just… So instead, I kinda did my report on a book I’ve never read before. I’m not sure anyone has, honestly. It’s a completely random paperback romance from 25 years ago. 

This is the Romance Novel Graveyard. We don’t deal with bestsellers or the beloved here, we deal with the forgotten, the overlooked, and the justifiably exiled. The orphans and the bastards of the romance world.

The books we’re going to read aren’t pretty. Good romance novels can melt your heart; most of these books will tear it out and fucking *eat it*.

If we keep reading random cheap paperback romances, maybe one day we’ll discover a really, really good one though! …Right? I mean, it could happen, right? 

No, I don’t think so either. But it’s the only thing that keeps me going.

Anyway, my book report today is on [*Red-Hot Ranchman* by Victoria Pade](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7085897-red-hot-ranchman). It’s from 1996. It’s… like a western or something, I don’t know. I’m literally typing this intro out before I’ve read it. It makes my sarcasm more authentic if I record my thoughts before the depression of the actual books hits me.

Can we all pause for just a moment and take a good long look at that cover? I don’t want to overstate, but it could quite possibly be the only perfect work of art man has ever created. It is AMAZING. Like the Marlboro Man sitting outside a porn store, either ushering you closer with the promise of free candy, or absently flicking the ash off the end of his joint while laughing at your petty judgements of him. I love his kicky little scarf worn with a completely unbuttoned shirt, and his creepily condescending expression (he’s almost amused that you don’t want to willingly get into his van. Because you’re **going** to get into his van, it’s only a question of whether you’re conscious or not at the time, little missy), and the fact his left index finger is deliberately pointing to his dick, and the low-key threat communicated by his belt made of bullets. This cover is a masterpiece of the art form. It is EVERYTHING. I would purchase this artwork *immediately* if it one day turned up at auction, and that’s not even a joke. Normally, I’m more about the bodice-ripper covers, but this artist decided to go with more of a “seedy carnie” vibe.  It’s a mustachioed miracle which solved all the problems which previously plagued my life. Now… there is only this cover. I simply want to stare at it in fearful awe, like that haunted painting in *Ghostbusters II*. 

Now that that’s out of the way, we can get down to business and actually read this book together…

**PLOT**

***SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!***

*Red-Hot Ranchman* is about a rancher who is red hot. He’s just moved into peaceful Pine Ridge, Colorado. But John Jarvis is a man who… Wait… “John”? His name is John? Seriously? (Childish whiney voice of disappointment) But that’s so boring! He’s a romance novel hero! I don’t think you’re even trying, Book. His name should be like “Holquinn Shaftington, Third Duke of Regentania” or “Jahleel” or “The Outcast, Zance Stormrunner” or “Lash Mancastle, The Billionaire of Bullets.” No, no, I refuse to call him John. That’s just his civilian identify anyway. I’m going to continue to call him by his REAL name: Red-Hot Ranchman (RHR). Anyway, the RHR is a man with big dreams. He owns the property which adjoins another property, but he does not have any of the water rights. This presents him an issue, since he wants to have a farm and raise cattle.

We are told that the Red-Hot Ranchman has “bolelike” thighs (had to Google, it means “like a tree-trunk” for people who didn’t get a thesaurus for Christmas ’96 like the author did). He has black hair, wears a black Stetson cowboy hat, and is “so heartstoppingly handsome that he could have posed for one of those cigarette ads” (note for younger Redditors: cigarette ads used to be thought of as sexy). He has “penetrating, sea-foam eyes” (lived on the ocean all my life, not sure what color that even is and don’t care to learn). “Tan, lean, hard, and handsome. He was a potent package.” We describe the hair on The Red-Hot Ranchman’s forearms several times throughout the book, like that would be a turn-on. It seems like an odd thing to be infatuated by, but I don’t kink-shame. You sail away on whatever floats your boat, FMC, just grab that wheel and steer it towards the stars. I’m in no position to judge. He is “one of those sullen, keep-to-himself cowboys,” with a jawline that leaves you “lightheaded” (sounds more like a blood pressure issue, might want to have that checked.) His mustache is “trimmed to a bristly sort of precision.” He walks with “long, confident, boot-shod strides.” (I’m not used to thinking of a human as being “shod,” that’s interesting phrasing. Not necessarily wrong or something that annoys me, just an interesting word choice by the author). He’s “been known to ride in \[a rodeo\] or two, but it wasn’t a big deal.” He dives a pick-up, but it’s a “bigger, newer truck” than yours, obviously. 

His neighbor, the one who controls his property’s access to water, is “The feisty” Paige Kenton. She has auburn hair “glinting with fiery highlights,” and eyes “just too pale a blue to ever go without \[mascara\],” but which “seemed to glow like beacons of light shining through barely colored glass.” She’s “compact, graceful,” “small and lithe,” and “proportioned just right, with breasts not too big, not too small” (as always, that’s my first concern with a romance heroine: how big are her breasts? Because if they’re too big or two small, then I can’t sympathize with such a monstrosity, obviously). Her “nose was flawless” and her skin “has no pores” (Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia is a serious condition, she might want to consult a medical professional about that, especially if it’s summertime). She sure “filled out a pair of blue jeans to perfection,” and she’s really good at yard work, apparently. Later in the book, the possibility of fixing up the barn with The RHR makes her “as excited…. as a bride on her wedding day.” She also bakes brownies, which makes her awesome in my book (I could go some brownies right now, Paige, just saying).

You know, as an aside, if after one meeting your potential boyfriend is already weighing in on the shape of your nose, he sounds *SUPER* controlling and judge-y. I’ve known people my whole life and have no opinion about their noses whatsoever, good or bad. She would need to have the most epic and mesmerizing nose in the history of all noses for me to even notice, let alone still be thinking about it a day later. Like… Amy Adams. Amy Adams has an outstanding nose, if you’ve never noticed. And you will now. (You’re welcome.)

Anyway, so Kate is interested in her new neighbor because her 6 year old son, Robbie, keeps…  Oh, *dammit to hell*. It’s a “single mom with a precocious kid” book. They’re the bane of my existence.

\*SIGH\*

Okay, here we go, back at it…

So “Robbie” is fascinated by his new neighbor and keeps going over there to talk to The Red-Hot Ranchman. This will be the main plot engine of the book and Robbie’s day-to-day activities are the nexus around which all of our lives now turn. Robbie’s wants and needs are the main driver of the action and drama.

You know, if my neighbor’s 6 year old kept wandering into my house at all times of the day and bugging me, I’d build a damn barbwire fence to keep him out. (GO HOME, ROBBIE!)

The book isn’t always… well… You know what? I’m just going to provide the quotes about Robbie’s visits to the house and let you judge for yourselves. The Red-Hot Ranchman “indulged himself” with Robbie, and “tried hard to fill the need Robbie seemed to have for contact with a man” and he “teaches \[Robbie\] a lot of things.” Umm… okay. I’m not even going to say anything about that, Book. You’re making me rather uncomfortable though. This isn’t even me really selectively editing much, this is literally the way you’re phrasing it most of the time. Can you see how that might be a problem? Do you understand why you need to be more careful with how you put things? Let’s… let’s just talk about the puppies some more and pretend like this didn’t happen, okay? Because this is getting really creepy.

(The Red-Hot Rancher has puppies.  They serve no purpose to the story other than being a means of luring Robbie into his home.) 

Weird mysterious bachelor you’ve never met, who conspicuously doesn’t date any of the adults in town, has your only child alone in his isolated farmhouse? Sounds fine to me, no worries. What could possibly go wrong? They’re having so many adventures together. ...So many secrets. I don’t believe in mommy shaming… but I feel like I need to be that lady in *Game of Thrones* just following Paige around, ringing the little bell and chanting “SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!” Come on, girl! I don’t care if this “isn’t the city,” you still shouldn’t be letting strangers spend time alone with your son. ***I*** wouldn’t feel comfortable in a stranger’s house like that, let alone allowing my child to do it. Especially not when the stranger in question is The Red-Hot Ranchman! Did you not see the cover!?! *That guy* has your son at his mercy right now!

Personally, I like to imagine that all of The Red-Hot Ranchman’s conversations with Robbie are like Peter Graves in *Airplane!* (""Joey, have you ever been in a Turkish prison?"") But that’s me.

Throughout this section of the book, we also learn a TON about their houses. For instance, Paige’s house “had been standing for over 60 years.” Wow. Amazing. My house was built in 1924 though, so… yeah, don’t care. Also, chapter 1 mentions a “secret cubbyhole in the closet,” and you expect that to be something which will come up in the last chapter, right?  It’s like the climax of the story just called you up and made a date to meet you there. Paige or Robbie, hiding in that cubby, trying not to make a sound as a shadowy danger searches the house for them. Only… yeah, no. Not so much. It will never be mentioned again. So, one less thing for us to worry about. Excellent.

Moving on.

This is a book very interested in the layout of the houses. We have literally described both the exterior and the interior of the house, in detail. We know more about what the houses look like than most of the characters. That’s an interesting choice. Maybe it’s going to be like *Hunchback of Notre Dame*, where the building itself gets an entire chapter describing it, because it’s the most important “character” in the story. Or maybe it’s just that the author simply likes houses. In either case, an interesting choice.

So, to summarize: The Red-Hot Ranchman is the sexy neighbor and Robbie is a pain in the ass (obviously) and is bothering him all the damn time. Everyone following me so far? Good. Because that’s the entire plot. It is literally the setting, explanation, and payoff for every scene.

There are a lot of burglaries in town recently, which is a backdrop to the main story. The burglaries are always when people are out of their homes (that won’t be important at all, I’m not sure why it’s mentioned several times in the book, but it told me so I’m telling you). These crimes are being investigated by Burt, the local law enforcement. I’m not sure we ever actually learn Burt’s last name, which seems like it might be an important clue of something but isn’t. What **is** important though is that he’s of marriageable age and is described as “pretty cute.” For anyone with experience with romance novels of the 90s, this should be setting off alarm bells loud enough to make your head explode. He’s handsome but is *NOT THE RED-HOT RANCHMAN!* Done deal, mystery over.

Can we all leave now? No? Okay, we’re continuing on…

Anyway, Burt tells Paige that he’ll keep an eye on her place and watch for the burglar. Yeah… yeah, I just *bet* you will. Bastard. See you in the big fight scene in Act 3.

Upon their arrival home, Paige sees someone with a flashlight on her back porch and rather than simply taking her son back out to the car and getting him to safety, she instead attacks this intruder with a baseball bat. As it turns out though, the trespasser is The Red-Hot Ranchman. And a baseball bat to the head isn’t going to stop that much man. Obviously. He’s just too badass to ever get a concussion or skull fracture.  He is “a cross between a Greek god and the Marlboro Man.” He is so manly that “even females of other species respond to him.” Yes, horses “flirt” with The Red-Hot Ranchman, like an “enraptured lady expecting her hand to be kissed.” He’s *THAT* masculine. He’s a hard man, who can “be as persistent as a nanny goat draggin’ clean wash off the line.” (Because he’s a cowboy, he drops the final “g” from words.) He is *SO* masculine that when Robbie falls down on the pet frog he was keeping in his pocket, squishing it dead (clumsy little freak, wish it was you crushed into a gooey puddle rather than Pete the Frog), The Red-Hot Ranchman “brung ‘im back to life” just by holding it (that’s not a joke or an exaggeration, it’s literally what happens.) Yes, you heard that right: The Red-Hot Ranchman is ***SO MUCH MAN THAT HIS TOUCH CAN FUCKING BRING PETS BACK TO LIFE!*** This cannot be overstated and is my new benchmark for how much a man someone is. There’s “Alpha,” and then there’s “his mere whim decides who lives and who dies.” *THAT’S* Alpha.

Paige and The Red-Hot Ranchman sexily have a cup of coffee together, both feeling a vibe. Paige has a “strong sense” that there’s some kind of “man-woman thing” going on between them, which leaves her “all too aware of the feminine side of herself that she rarely had cause to pay attention to anymore.” (Paige is really into gender being a binary thing rather than a beautiful, complex tapestry, it seems. That’s not cool, Paige. Be an ally.) She has difficulty forming words with “a mouth that only wanted to know the feel of his supple lips, of that bushy mustache.” They discuss the water rights some. (Nothin’ sexier than negotiations over water rights. I say that as an environmental law attorney. Sometimes, the courtroom becomes like a rave club, man, with all the sexy grinding going on and the overwhelming hotness of the situation. An orgy looks tame compared to a good land use law hearing. It makes sex look like church.) And then The Red-Hot Ranchman leaves.

The rest of the book basically amounts to “then some other stuff happened” while we wait for our main characters to have sexy time and for Burt to be revealed to be evil (look surprised when it happens or it’ll hurt his feelings.) 

Paige and Robbie have an uneventful trip to “Papa Billy Bo Bob’s Pizza” with Paige's friend. As an aside, I used to love Showbiz Pizza, back in the day. When Billy-Bob, the robotic banjo playing bear front-man of “The Rock-afire Explosion” would sing with his friends to all the kids in the audience. Ah, memories.  So many romance novels (and restaurants) could be improved with the addition of a robotic animal band, belting out 80s pop hits and public domain tunes. Just saying.

Where was I? Oh, yeah. Robbie was ruining another dinner (surprised he didn’t try to swallow one of the forks or something, little idiot) and The Red-Hot Ranchman was lurking in his house, all mysterious and sexy and isolated from the uncaring world.

The Red-Hot Ranchman then cures “Frieda the Cow,” who belongs to Paige and who was poisoned with lye and was making ”a mournful moo.” Hell, you help an animal that’s making a mournful moo (despite the unintentional hilarity of the words), and I’d want to sleep with you too, dude. Mournful moos are the worst. (It’d be a badass band name though, “*Red-Hot Ranchman and the Mournful Moos: opening this week at Papa Billy Bo Bob’s Pizza!*”)

We talk about clothes a lot in this book, by the way. What everyone is wearing is spelled out every time they change. I’ve never understood why some authors do this. As a reader, unless it’s somehow important to the character, I just don’t care what color Paige’s pants are today. Hell, I don’t care if she’s wearing them at all. In fact, that might make the story more exciting and eventful (“*Paige Kenton’s Pants-less Day*, coming this fall from Harlequin Romance!”). I mean, yes, The Red-Hot Ranchman needs to wear his black Stetson, obviously. That’s a character thing. But it’s not necessary that you tell me that Robbie is wearing sneakers or that the blonde lady in the Trans Am that Burt was talking to at the beginning (it’s a thing, you won’t care about it any more than I do, trust me, but we *will* be mentioning it again in Act 3, so be aware of her) is wearing white leather (a detail made all the more confusing since the book is set during a very hot august, yet it has no explanation).

Then Paige’s barn is set on fire, and if you’ve ever read a romance in your life, I’m sure you can write that dialogue yourself, as the scant few secondary characters in our story all wonder if The Red-Hot Ranchman was behind it, and Paige is all just, “No.. no, he couldn’t have. He’s too sexy and mustachioed for that! But… but what if he’s the one who did it? No… no, he couldn’t have. But what if…”

Okay, so The Red Hot Ranchman and Paige decide to go out on a date, because… well, he’s a sexual gravity well which pulls all females towards him. You can’t possibly resist “the sheer potency of his masculinity.” For their date, Paige wears a “black silk” jumpsuit with a “vibrant red-poppy print” and a “bright sash wrapped around one hip and knotted at the other.” Umm… you’re going for sexy and you chose a jumpsuit? That’s… an interesting choice. Not the one I would have gone with. But you be you, Paige. You be you.

(*…Jeez, it’s no wonder her first husband left her.*)

What? Sorry? No, I didn’t say anything. Why?

Robbie is chirping excitedly about The Red-Hot Ranchman being in the house (SHUT UP, ROBBIE! You’re ruining it!), and we get to hear a lot more of his stupid sentence structure and mispronunciations. The book tells us that he can speak normal, he just chooses not to, I guess because he thinks he’s adorable (you’re too old for that, Robbie! GROW UP!) For instance, Paige tells him that they owe The Red-Hot Ranchman a “debt of gratitude,” and because Robbie is as stupid as a burlap sack filled with dead frogs and manure, he starts saying that they owe him “a jet of gravy tubes.”

(Deep calming breath… Deep calming breath, don’t freak out…)

*Oh, fuck you, Robbie! No one likes you! GO HOME!*

The “jetful of gravy tubes” becomes a labored running joke between them (hurray, you two are so funny. \*eye roll\*), then Paige quips that she “can’t imagine how I could make good on a whole jetful of something,” and The Red-Hot Ranchman replies with “I’ll try to think of something that won’t be too much of a strain.” 

(Blinks once. Twice…)

*DAAAAMN!* He’s talking about his dick right now, Paige, you know that right? At the start of your first date, in your kitchen, in front of your 6 year old son, while you’re wearing your demure Sunday best, that “unsettlingly sexy“ cowboy just flat-out told you that he’s going to climax all over you and that you’re going to like it. **THAT’S** how The Red-Hot Ranchman flirts. It ain’t like that weak-ass, pretty-boy big city flirtin’ you’re used to, little missy. This here is how a REAL MAN flirts!

I cannot express to you how shamefully happy this exchange makes me. I’m not even joking right now. It would have been worth the cost of this book to watch that happen, right there. For this guy cosplaying as The Porno Marlboro Man to push this innocent single mom to her knees, in her boring little kitchen, on her dull-ass farm, and “make good on a jetful” of his release, and then take her and her son out for pizza afterward. I’d pay the quarter this book cost to watch that happen, no doubt. But I’m demented, so don’t be like me. Oh, that way lies only madness and terrible paperback romances. Don’t be anything like me. Save yourself.

These… these are perhaps thoughts I should have but not record and post online for strangers. Or better yet, thoughts I shouldn’t be having at all.

Never mind, we don’t have time to dwell on our own faults, we’re moving on…

Robbie then loses his cherished baseball player doll in the woods (*you can't do ANYTHING right, can you, Robbie!?!* WHY ARE YOU HERE!?!) and while searching for it, Paige and he are attacked by someone wielding a bow and arrow. Sadly, Robbie survives.

They run to the Red-Hot Ranchman’s house and meet his brother, Dwight (seriously, it’s like someone is intentionally picking ordinary names rather than badass romance hero ones. That man should be named something like “Adorjan the Bastard Count,” we *ALL* know it), who has just arrived from Texas to check on his brother.

Dwight’s main job in the story is to… I’m actually not sure. I can’t think of any story purpose he accomplishes, honestly. But either way, he’s here. He’s a complete non-entity. Ignore him. The book does.

The Red-Hot Ranchman decides that he needs to sleep over to make certain that nothing bad happens during the night. Paige and The Red-Hot Ranchman then almost have passionately sweaty sex on the living room coffee table, giving into their lust with wild, sexual abandon… but then Paige remembers that she’s a mom and calls a stop to it. (THANKS, ROBBIE!) It’s “too soon.” Well, you’d better get a rush on, because we are on page 179 of a 250 page book and thus far this hasn’t exactly been a BDSM sex party. I blame Robbie. Kid’s the ultimate mood killer. Paige seems kind of subdued and lady-like, but I bet she’d be the life of the party once the music started, you know what I’m saying? You can tell. You get that sense about her. And you just need to take one look at The Red-Hot Ranchman to know he’s probably wanted in several states for the sick kind of shit he could do to Paige sexually. *Look at that man and tell me he doesn’t know sexual positions and own kinky toys that none of us have ever even heard of.* You can see it on his face! Which means the reason why this book has thus far been behind schedule on shamefully erotic content is a certain 6 year old wearing “action figure pajamas.” Little bastard, ruining the fun, as usual. 

(*No wonder his father fled town and never calls him…*)

What? No, you must be hearing things. Robbie is a delight!

The next morning The Red-Hot Ranchman gives Robbie a lesson on shaving (you DO NOT want to put a straight razor in my hand and let me anywhere near Robbie, fair warning, Paige). Then they find one of The Red-Hot Ranchman’s piglets hung up with a noose on the porch (nice job watching the house, asshole). The Red-Hot Ranchman then speculates that Robbie, the 6 year old who can barely speak, has enemies which could be behind all of this. That it could be “Robbie who’s drawing the rancor for all this” (The Red-Hot Ranchman is pronouncing the letter “g” now, so you know shit just got real!) Yeah, John, I bet it was Heather Burns, the 6 year old that according to page 29, Robbie “punched in the stomach at the Fourth of July.” I bet she’s just been biding her time and is now resorting to poisoning and arson to get her revenge. Nice one, Robbie. (Little dipshit, look at all the pain you’ve caused! GO HOME!)

Then they decide that they need to fix the arson damage to the barn, so they agree to meet up again. You can tell that The Red-Hot Ranchman is going to get lucky tonight, because Paige doesn’t just braid her hair… she *French Braids it!* (Little trollop. God is watching, Paige, remember that!) 

Oh… while they’re fixing the barn, all sexy and stuff, The Red-Hot Ranchman “whistles a lot.” Okay, I’m out. That’s going to get real old, real fast. **RELATIONSHIP ENDED.**

They have a conversation about the dead piglet and Robbie’s insistence that The Red-Hot Ranchman could fix it and the fact that The RHR didn’t deny that. Then The Red-Hot Ranchman reveals that yes, he does indeed have magic powers over life and death.

Seriously.

(FYI to all those readers too young to remember: the little “*More than Men*” logo on the front cover was Harlequin’s Hot Guys with Superpowers imprint. It was all part of that 90s *Interview with the Vampire*, *X-Men: the Animated Series, X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer* kind of scene. Super-powers were big then, but they were more paranoid *Firestarter* kind of powers rather than being *The Avengers*. So, The Red-Hot Ranchman’s superpowers were obvious if you are familiar with paperbacks of the period. If not, then my guess is that you’re really surprised over this revelation, especially since they serve no real purpose to the plot. But either way, we’re just going to go with it. We don’t judge here in the Romance Novel Graveyard. We’re here but to read and mock and love.)

As it turns out, The Red-Hot Ranchman was struck by lightning (not making that up), giving him healing hands. Like if Michael Clarke Duncan in *The Green Mile* was some white porno cowboy looking guy. He feels their pain, recognizes where it is, and then heals it with his touch. This made him locally famous as a healer, so he’s fled his Texas home to escape the sick and infirmed. Which is… good? I guess? I’m not sure how to think about that, honestly. While he’s here having fresh brownies (Mmmm… brownies), there’s probably some little girl dying of cancer back in Texas who could have been healed right now. But whatever, we’re moving on…

And what if Paige had a gynecological problem? Would The Red-Hot Ranchman feel that too? Would he even recognize where an ovary was inside his own body? We are told that he “may be the first man to actually experience the pain of childhood,” which implies that yes, he can help with women’s health issues too. But can “The Gift” factory-reset a hymen? Would Paige suddenly become a virgin every time he touched her? And if he shares the pain of the people he’s healing, what would that feel like for him given their vastly different anatomy? Would it impact their love life if they had to go through that Every. Damn. Time. they had sex? And is this even appropriate talk for a Reddit board about romance novels anymore? I’m not sure, but I have so many questions about this book.

Paige has her doubts about his news, which is silly because it seems like all you’d have to do is prick your finger and ask him to heal it. No fuss, no muss. But I guess they can’t do that, for some reason. Instead, they’re both like, “Oh, so you’re basically a god. Cool. Let’s go out for steaks.  I’m starving.” Seriously, that’s basically it. So they go out to dinner and dancing (it’s the 90s, he’s a cowboy, and there is no line-dancing or *Achy Breaky Heart* in this. The fathomless depths of my disappointment is a living, primal thing destined to visit its hideous anger upon this grim, undeserving world.) 

Then they go home and it’s magic time…

(She uses the word “derriere” in her internal monologue. I’m telling you, wrong or not, I want to see this woman’s body get *utterly destroyed* in bed by a rough badass Alpha cowboy. I mean, it’s not like he can’t just fix the damage after, right? She’s not even in danger of soreness. There is no downside. Go to town, you two! *Go to town!*)

Or not.

Instead they make gentle, respectful love. (Eye roll)

The next morning the phone rings, and although The Red-Hot Ranchman votes to ignore it, promising he’ll “make it worth \[her\] while,” Paige declares that it might be Robbie so she has to answer it. (*Dammit, Robbie!* Even when you’re not in the scene, you’re ruining the scene! This is a romance novel; I want inappropriately detailed love scenes! GO AWAY!)

Turns out its Burt, telling her that The Red-Hot Ranchman killed a man in Texas and that’s why he’s hiding out here. And since Burt is absolutely ***not*** the bad guy in any way and should always, ALWAYS be trusted, Paige confronts The Red-Hot Ranchman about this starling accusation. The Red-Hot Ranchman shares that the last man he tried to heal had died on the table, and that’s why he doesn’t heal people anymore. Because he felt burnt out and was worried about hurting someone.

The Red-Hot Ranchman compares possibly killing a man to eating too much pie (no, he seriously does).  Paige blames The Red-Hot Ranchman for this unseen event which happened years ago (the murder, not the pie-eating), they argue, and he leaves.

Then the phone rings again. As it turns out, someone has kidnapped Robbie! 

(...*Who the fuck would want that kid?)*

What? No, I said, my god! I hope they find him! That poor child!

So… I don’t even remember what happened then, honestly. I read it less than 10 minutes ago and I have no idea. I think Dwight stops by to tell her that Robbie was dead in the barn or something? 

(HURRAY!)

When she gets there, she finds that The Red-Hot Ranchman and Burt are fighting. Burt says that The Red-Hot Ranchman hurt Robbie and The Red-Hot Ranchman says that Burt did it. Personally, I’m willing to thank them both and call it a day. But in either case, Robbie is dying and needs The Red-Hot Ranchman to unleash “The Gift.” Which he does, after kicking Burt’s ass for being the bad guy.

Once again, I am overwhelmed with shock when it’s revealed that the bad guy is the only other guy in the book. The innocuous one, who is described as handsome but not quite as handsome as the book’s hero, and who is suspected of cheating on Paige’s best friend. 

What. 

A. 

Surprise.

As it turns out, Burt was hooked on drugs from a previous injury and was robbing folks in order to pay for them. He was trying to scare Paige out of town before she could tell anyone she’d seen his dealer, the blonde lady in the Trans Am, wearing white leather in the heat of summer (told you that would come up again and that you wouldn’t care). This is an issue for me, because it connects to nothing else in the book. Burt being behind it all has to link back up to Robbie’s missing dad, Paige herself, or The RHR’s super-powers. We need some sort of arc there. It doesn’t have to connect to all of them, but it has to be at least one of those or it doesn’t really matter to the story. “I don’t want you to tell anyone you saw me with a lady driving a Trans Am because she sells me drugs” is not a suitable excuse for sneaking onto someone’s property and hanging a baby piglet up in a noose. That implies a personal connection which is lacking here, and this explanation seems tacked on and stupid.

In any case, the book ends with The Red-Hot Ranchman and Paige getting engaged.

Oh, and those water rights were never settled. Just saying. That’s still at issue in their relationship and the book never deals with it. Simply being married isn’t going to cure that, by the way. Colorado is a marital property state, meaning that her property remains hers and his property remains his, unless they change the land titles. So, yeah, The Red-Hot Ranchman is screwed on that front. He’s still got no rights to that water, unless she dies.

**SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:**

Paige doesn’t really get to do a lot in this other than be a single mom in need of a man. She doesn’t solve any problems by herself or have a real personality. She’s not as annoying as a lot of characters in these books I’ve read, but that’s probably because she’s not enough of a character to even be annoying. She’s basically the “default” character, without any individuality. I think we could have given her some kind of personality other than “nice.” I’ve kind of had my full of heroines who are sweet but downtrodden bruised flowers who don’t know how beautiful they truly are. Make her the town slut. Make her have gotten away with murder that one time. Give her a drinking problem, a limp, and a foul mouth. Have her have gotten drunk as a teen and passed out while her baby sister was drowning in the pool and now she’s crippled with guilt over that. Have her watch pornography while she’s supposed to be babysitting her niece and LOVE ice hockey. I don’t know or care, just so long as it isn’t that she’s the gentlest little flower in God’s garden. That’s not interesting and I don’t want to read it.

It would be cooler if Dwight had the Touch of Death. Like, if The Red-Hot Ranchman came out of the lightning strike with the powers of healing, but Dwight (who hasn’t actually hit by the bolt, but it would be cooler if he had been) came out of it with only the ability to hurt people. He’d be so dark, and edgy, and cruel to a world which had shunned him.

for a little context, I’m from the UK and I usually read YA fiction

I had really really high hopes for this book but honestly, I’m quite disappointed by it. I love the characters and their relationship but I feel like it’s dragging on so long and it’s a little repetitive 
I absolutely loved when they hated each other and fell in love but after that it was repetitive in the sense that they’d be apart, find an excuse to be together, have sex ( which to me lasted a little too long to be worth all the pages ) and then they’d be apart within a singular sentence. I’m not sure if it’s to do with my maturity or not but I’d rather read about how they feel about each other way more than the descriptions of their sex.
It kinda ruins the plot for me, having to put on hold the development of their relationship just so their steamy sex scenes can happen. 
When they’re not together, it’s pretty much only about American politics which confuses me seeing as I have little knowledge about the politics in that country. I understand that the book would heavily reference politics but I didn’t expect to read that much on it :’) 
I will admit however, I did go Into this book without any knowledge about how truly in depth it would be in American politics.
It’s not a bad book! It’s just, I’m struggling to follow the plot when they talk about politics and I get a bit bored reading them talk about sex for the seventh time.
I’m still not finished with the book so maybe the remaining half will let me love it but honestly, I’m only reading it just to say i have.

n2ut9c,"I just finished Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston and I can't stop thinking about it.","Some context for where I am in my life at the moment: I'm 24 and I *just* finished my Bachelor's degree in English one week ago. I had been looking forward to pleasure reading again since 99% of what I've read the past few years has been for school. I started *The Secret History* which was definitely enticing but I felt so burned out from my exams that I didn't want to read anything that would require extra effort to understand or discern. 

I picked up *Red, White & Royal Blue* since it's been on my radar for the past few years thinking it would be a fun, fluffy, and campy read. I was surprised when I realized that (1) it's actually not a YA novel as I thought it was, it's about two characters in their 20s, and (2) I actually found myself deeply invested in the characters and their dynamic, to the point where they started to feel like real people I was getting to know. I *love* being surprised by a book like this. 

This isn't to say the novel was perfection from start to finish. The beginning reeks of blatant exposition while the ending was a little too abrupt and clean, but the middle parts made up for all of that. I loved how lived-in the dynamic between Alex and Henry were, how realistic and wonderful their relationship was, and how McQuiston really captures the experience of queer self-discovery.  

The only thing is that I'm now devastated about having finished it and not following these characters' journeys anymore. I also can't bring myself to start another book (*The Heart's Invisible Furies* by John Boyne is next on my list) even though I've been feeling like reading because I think I'll start comparing it to my experience reading *RW&RB* which is not an ideal way to start a new book. Has anyone felt this way about a certain book or have thoughts on *RW&RB* in particular?

Red, white & royal blue is one of those feel good books that you can't help but devourer as soon as you get a hold of it. I loved how it didn't really deviate from the current state of the world - it was just like our world, except with a splash of hope thrown in.

I bought this book six months ago? when I was looking for queer books as a queer person myself, I was craving representation and something I could relate to. For some reason I never read any of the books I bought but RWRB was always calling my name.

Four days ago I finally read it and I breezed right through it. I finished it in two and a half days, which is short for me because I'm a slow reader. My God, it was wonderful. I genuinely loved all the characters. I'm so happy this book exists and I wish there was more of it. Now I'm kicking myself for not having read it sooner.

The book isn't without its flaws, of course, but most of them I could overlook. The only gripe I had with the book was that I think the writing was lacking a little. As an aspiring editor, so many times I thought to myself *Arrghh who edited this? Some of the sentences don't flow naturally and there's not much sentence variety!* There were also things that happened which I thought were too convenient. However, it wasn't such a big deal that it took away from my experience reading the book.

I loved how the main character was bisexual, and as a bisexual woman, I could totally relate to him questioning himself during his bisexual revelation. I already want to re-read it but I also want to fully digest it before I do.

Now I'm back on my queer book kick and am now reading Cemetery Boys!

up667t,"Spicy, steamy romances about NORMAL PEOPLE?","I’ve been really into fantasy romances for a while, but I’m kind of tired of those, so I started reading some… I’m not sure what to call them - modern day romances? But they all seem to feature billionaires and women with perfect figures and baby’s butt skin and men that look like professional models who attract the attention of every male-attracted person in a mile radius. Or a super-well adjusted 22 year old astrophysics professor at Harvard (I come from academia so those books are hard to not roll my eyes at).

Anything I’ve tried that features more “normal” people tends to be really sweet but not spicy. I’d love to find some suggestions for normal people in a realistic setting that are also well written and SPICEH. 

The closest thing I can think of to this that I’ve read is One Last Stop - I’m not super well read in romance - although it could have been spicier and was obviously somewhat fantasy and, sadly, problematic (as a great post on here detailed a while back). 

No cheating please, and unfortunately I’m also not a big fan of HR (open to suggestions that might change my mind on that, I suppose). Age gap is fine, FF is fine, bonus points for anything available on audio :)

mocdnr,Is anyone else really tired of characters finding people sexy when they're mad? Do normal people feel like that in arguments?,"I swear that every single book I pick up lately has a scene where the main couple is fighting and one of the characters is always like ""Ohhh but it's so sexy when he/she bites their lip like that"" or ""the flames in their eyes lights up the heat in my core"" 

I can't think of a single time when I have been in an actual argument with someone and thought ""yeah this is sexy let's bang"". Maybe it's just me but even *after* the fact once things are resolved I feel a little bit salty and over emotional still and there's no way I am in the mood or thinking about sex.

I also find it weirdly condescending? Like they can't be taken seriously when they're mad because they're too sexy/cute whatever. I will say obviously the caveat here would be if it's a cutesy joke argument, but that's not what I am talking about in these books. 

So am I the only one who finds this weird as hell or am I the outlier here? It always seems to be the H internally thinking this about the h but I'm reading a Sapphic romance right now and it just happened.

I loved the reassurances provided by the male characters of the books because I have kinda negative self-confidence lol.

vsp9nt,Normal People by Sally Rooney,"I get that this book was p popular when it came out (but not necessarily here). Popular enough to get a tv adaptation. 

I took my time with the book, finished in about 3 days. Her prose was different, at first it was strange, but then I enjoyed it. Like, you’re reading passing internal thoughts that are sobering and honest. 

I searched this sub and I agree with previous comments that say it doesn’t really fall into a romance book. More like fiction drama with romantic undertones? It definitely wasn’t HEA but it some ways it could possibly be read as one? Heartbreaking though. Beautiful, but also beautifully sad.

It’s funny, all of my girlfriends have read it, but none of them read romance books like I do. They were always appalled when I said I haven’t read it. “How do you say you like romance books but haven’t read any Sally Rooney?” It seems like it wasn’t well received here, and I think I can understand why but I cannot put my finger on it exactly. 

Anyways, I started the tv show and I now have a distracting obsession with Paul Mescal. [On episode 7 so please no spoilers if it doesn’t end like how the book ends] 

Is this a recommendation post? I’m not sure. I will say that it’s a book that will stay with me.

I ended up being a reader that connected with the novel and highly encourage people who are on the fence to read it.

pmmj87,"Romance with ""normal people"" in extraordinary situations. No ""power fantasy archetypes""","I love romance but I'm honestly a little tired of all the power fantasy based off looks or positions (in society you perv!) and want to read some stuff based more off normal every-day people, the kind you see working at a clothing store, or attending a university, or driving a 10 year old used car because that's what they can afford... you know... NORMAL PEOPLE.

However I love exotic and wild situations, so I love when normal people are put in extraordinary situations. Like castaways on an island, or trapped in a cabin during a snowstorm, or just a sequence of wild events that keep happening to them that they have to deal with.

I want BOTH romantic leads to be fairly down-to-earth normal people, they can be successful or even leaders but more like ""I'm a manager at Wendy's and own my own home"" kind of success, not billionaire dukes and self-made entrepreneurial career women running for President. And please please please no ""magazine cover"" bodies if you get my meaning.

M/F or F/F preferred. Minimal to no BDSM (It can otherwise be steamy, but whips and ropes aren't my thing). No Alpha-holes. Also prefer something that doesn't have a depressive negative vibe to it, overly sad characters or excessive trauma is a bit of a mood kill for me.

ho3zbr,"Recommendations for a slow burn between normal(ish), relatable people?","Hi everyone! I’ve been in an intense romance binge and I’m looking for more. I’ve come to realise that I love romances between ordinary, kind of relatable people. So far I’ve stuck to contemporaries but I don’t mind exploring other sub-genres!

I loved:

- Beach Read by Emily Henry -
This book has effectively ruined all other romance books for me. Despite the hilarious banter between the characters, the writing style was really lovely and enjoyable. The relationship between the protagonists felt so genuine and I just really liked that they felt like normal people, where looks weren’t the main focus of attraction and where the male love interest wasn’t a 6’10 giant with bulging biceps and ripped abs lol.

- You Deserve Each Other by Sarah Hogle -
A hilarious read, though this is where the ish in normal(ish) comes into play haha. A bit of an unusual situation and a quirky narrator but very likeable nonetheless. The slow repair of the characters’ relationship was so heartwarming and felt really genuine in its showcase of vulnerability. 

- The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller -
Okay, not about normal people but an honest to god literary masterpiece. Lyrical, poetic prose which made me sob my eyes out.

- The Flatshare by Beth O’Leary -
Another great fluffy read between two ordinary people. Loved the premise of this one, and really liked how fairly simple the plot was, with a greater focus on their personalities and connection rather than external events.

- The Rosie Project by Graeme Simpson -
Another funny one with two protagonists who were easy to root for. 

I liked but didn’t love:

- The Hating Game by Sally Thorne -
Highly enjoyable mostly but some parts of the novel really irked me like the obsession with being sMoL and the super mysterious close-to-death random sickness? Lmao. But maaaan the slow burn was hella good with this one and it had such a satisfying conclusion. 

- The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang -
Good but the male love interest just felt too perfect and not like a real person. Their relationship was pretty amazing though! The read was highly enjoyable. 

- Melt for You by JT Geissinger -
Pretty good read but I’m just not into books that overly objectify / push unrealistic male and female body standards. Also not that into celebrities tbh. 

Meh / Didn’t enjoy:

- The Bromance Book Club by Lyssa Kay Adams had kind of unlikeable protagonists for me. I think the relationship was well done but I just wasn’t super invested in it because the characters didn’t draw me. Also children in books aren’t that great lmao. 

- The Unhoneymooners by Christina Lauren didn’t have the most compelling characters or writing style. It was just very middle of the road.

- I understand what the message was supposed to be in The Simple Wild by KA Tucker but it was a little off putting when the love interest kept putting down the protagonist for wearing makeup, dressing up in nice clothes, etc. 

- Love Lettering by Kate Clayborn was an interesting premise but I think it had parts where it was written in quite a confusing way with an extreme focus on the anatomy of letters and fonts haha. I liked the relationship development between the characters and it was very sweet but then the ending was so... strange and conspiracy-like. 

- Well Met by Jen DeLuca seemed promising but I don’t think the enemies to lovers trope was done well here. I felt as though the chemistry between the characters was forced and wasn’t very invested in their relationship because it didn’t feel realistic. 

- The Happy Ever After Playlist by Abby Jimenez was my first venture into instant love and probably my last. DNF. Also I know it’s just a stage name but really? “Jaxon”?? Kill me.

Bit of a long list and I’m sorry I’m pickyyy but I’m just chasing the high I got from experiencing Beach Read! 😭",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/ho3zbr/recommendations_for_a_slow_burn_between_normalish/,2020-07-09T14:25:15Z,31,23,RomanceBooks,Normal People,POST
knqr5a,Low-stakes historical recommendations? Reasonably normal people falling in love in fancy clothes.,"A while ago there was a post looking for low-stakes contemporaries, and I'd like to make a similar request for historicals. 

Basically, I'm feeling emotionally and mentally burned out and just want to read about reasonably normal people falling in love in fancy clothes (preferably looking for MF pairs). I want the trope scale set to low--for instance, if it's an enemies-to-lovers situation, maybe it's more a mutual-dislike-to-lovers. I'd like the MCs to either know how to use their words or be cognizant that they should use their words to resolve issues. I would like a competent heroine and maybe some witty banter. If there's sex, that's a bonus, but fade-to-black is ok too. 

So, any recommendations for the romance equivalent of a cup of instant hot chocolate?

I don’t care if there’s a happy or sad ending (but please don’t spoil whether it’s sad or happy if you recommend a book). What I on the other hand do care about is the time aspect, maybe some first love meets later in life, how they affect each other over the years, a deep connection nobody else gets or something like that. Also - I’m a huge sucker for a dramatic “first” meeting after a separation.

I’m not sure if this is enough info? Otherwise please ask - I truly hope for some recommendations and I might be terrible at using this subreddit, google and/or goodreads but I can’t find any books with these themes for the life of me.

\-Isn't cynical about love and isn't traumatized by past relationships because she is a strong independent woman.

\-Outgoing and sweet, and only sarcastic when the time is right,not as a part of her personality.

\-Works in STEM or some high paying field, instead of writing for a magazine or whatever go-to heroine career that authors go for.

\- Doesn't instantly fall in love because of the hero's jawline, but rather falls in love overtime because of the hero's personality.

10xbkok,"Looking for erotica with normal, well-adjusted characters","Hi, I'm a guy who likes erotica. My wife has been an avid romance and erotica reader for decades and occasionally something she talks about piques my interest and I'll check it out. The latest was the first Bromance Bookclub book, which I enjoyed.

My problem with most erotica I come is the fantasy misogyny. I can't get into many of the tropes ""dickhhole guy is mean, girl thinks she can fix him and falls in love, he's still dickhole later but a little nicer."" I don't enjoy degradation/humiliation, non-consent or partial-consent, or Stockholm syndrome like kidnap victims falling in love with their captors. I'd also prefer to read about somewhat regular people rather than the billionaire playboy.

Is there anything out there, published so I can get it on Audible, not fanfic, that fits what I'm looking for? I want to read smut about overall nice people with complex problems, not one-dimensional tropes that are resolved through brute force writing.

i4zgln,"Recommendation that meets a lot of requests I see here: Normal, nice, low drama, regular people in their 40s, with average/plus size. Sweetest in the Gale","Ok you guys, this might get long, but suck it up. You've been asking for things, and this delivers a lot of those things.

Olivia Dade is a rising author who is giving representation to more people in romance. I read Teach Me and, while it was enjoyable, it wasn't my favorite, so i didn't return to her work for a bit. But it did have many good points.

After falling in love with the gorgeous cover and lovely blurbs, i had to grab Sweetest in the Gale. It's a collection of three short stories, appx 100 pages long each. The first two are very loosely interconnected and take place in the same high school as Teach Me, but all can be read alone. Each story had its own little illustration, which charmed the socks right off of me. 

Book 1: Teachers next door to each other, both dealing with grief, find a new start in love. There's a lot of poetry bandied about, and some very clear boundaries drawn and respected. Both MCs 40ish, plus size heroine, zero steam, ending made me cry. Male POV. Very sweet. CW >!grief, loss of loved ones off-page!<

Book 2: Opposites attract. Uptight teacher dude mentors art teacher who seems a tad messy but is kickass at her job and an artist on the side. Both characters are lonely souls. The guy is a little dickish for like one minute, and then is smitten. Dade shoehorned in a >!nonbinary student tidbit, which she also did in Teach Me. While i have zero issue with gender indentity and enjoy seeing it represented more,!< it felt slightly preachy and not necessary to the story. No biggie. Both MCs early 40s i think, passionate about teaching, and sort of ignite when they get together. Plus size >!bisexual!< heroine. Mid level steam. Male POV. *Worth it for the epilogue alone you guys... omg*

Book 3: Unconnected to the others. Marriage of convenience in order to give the FMC Healthcare coverage due to a breast cancer scare (in blurb so not a spoiler). The author clearly leans left, and took a clear potshot at the clusterfuck that is the US Healthcare industry. But it didn't overshadow the plot. MCs are in their mid to late 40s and longtime friends. Guy is divorced, kids are grown so don't show up. Both characters plus size with normal jobs. MMC is an utter sweetheart. Mid level steam. Dual POV. CW >!breast cancer, mastectomy, off-page substance abuse by ex, loss of parent!<

The thread that runs through all of these is a respect and kindness for each other. I also enjoy seeing people who are dedicated to what they do for a career.

And- As the owner of a body that shows evidence of a close relationship with pastries, the average-to-chonky body types made me feel *seen* but not *pandered to.*

No surprise magical powers, not a badass, her love of MMC isn't saving the day, she's not some super capable lady who's got a well of inner strength to run thing in the background or run off into battle. She's not the MMC's fated mate or giving him extra power somehow, although chosen mates are fine.

I'd prefer FMC to be gentle, sweet, and a bit of a scaredy-cat, especially at first. Maybe she has a traumatic backstory™, maybe she's just an introvert.

I'm okay with just about any scenario leading to the MCs meeting. Maybe she's a human princess and there's a marriage alliance between the humans and a supernatural (vampires, demons, werewolves, fae, etc) for a treaty. Maybe the MMC happens to see her out and about, becomes intrigued, and whisks her off to his land after following her and deciding she's who he wants to be his bride. Maybe someone kidnaps FMC and brings her to MMC as an offering of some kind.

I'd prefer for MMC to not be cruel to her. Maybe he's indifferent in the beginning, but never mean to her. I'd really like the MMC to be a leader of some kind, who will do anything to protect his people, and especially to protect the FMC.

Bonus points if FMC is plus sized, but definitely not necessary!

If anyone has any recommendations, I'd greatly appreciate them. I love some good paranormal/fantasy romance where the MCs square off against the big bad, but I'm burnt out on FMCs being super powerful, or if she's not, the MMC only being interested because they're fated mates",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/180tgcq/fantasyparanormal_romance_with_normalgentle_fmc/,2023-11-21T22:27:28Z,26,29,RomanceBooks,Normal People,POST
113srf5,Looking for books that have a bodyguard MMC but the FMC is just a normal person,"It's kind of specific but I recently read and then reread 😂 {The men with the golden cuffs by Lexi Blake} and I really enjoyed the dynamic between the two bodyguards and the FMC. So obviously I tried to find similar books, but I've found that I really really really hate romance books that feature celebrities/royals/famous people/rich people as a main character. They tend to focus on what being in that kind of spotlight can feel like waaaaaay too much and it bores me into NFing. The men with the golden cuffs doesn't do that. The problem is it just makes more sense for a celebrity etc. to have a bodyguard so I've had a lot of trouble finding a book where the FMC is just your average Joe.

Thanks in advanced🥰. RH and LGBTQIA+ are welcome, I love angst and enemies-to-lovers but historical is just not my jam.

That's all i remember but i hope you all can help me out! Thank you!!

17a4u7k,Looking for a book with FMC thinking domestic violence is normal and even right with a caregiver cinnamon roll MMC !,"Hi !

I am looking for a specific kind of trope : a world were domestic violence is a norm or just largely accepted. It's in their morals like my dad beat my mom and it's ok/normal as a woman I must expect the same and try hard not to make my husband angry. If he use his fists on me, it's my fault.

The trope work with juste the FMC and her family beeing like that : like her ""father"" was beating her mother so she think it's normal then her ""husband"" beat her to and then she end up with MMC and she try her hardest to be ""a good wife"" and he juste love her and help her flying with har magnificiant wings.

Then come the caregiver part. MMC just don't like to ether partaque in such a behavior or he is just normal. I would love if MMC help FMC thrive so she can get over her fear and ""be reborn anew""

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Must have : mouse type fmc who has a hard time healing from her fear of MMC and has zero confidence in hersef.  
Exemple : she is like the best chef ever and every dame diner she make she is like : please please please make it so that he like it so he don't broke two of my ribs.

She try to be invisible to MMC and somehow always available for him so he can't fault her for hinding or something and it's a very dificult task to accomplish. I love when the FMC flinch or protect herself like a hedgehog and MMC try to reassure her or appear less threatening but failed and then juste try harder.

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Bonus :

\- MMC is known to be brutal and bloody like he is the boogeyman that scare the childrens in the story **cherry on the top ?** He has a physical apparence that goes with it like scars, beeing big, rough etc...

\- Just FMC family and FMC marriage are fucked up and MMC make them pay hard for what they have done to her. killing is an option, forced lifelong redemption is very sweat to.

**-** FMC become independent emotionaly a bit with work, a hobby, studies ... and MMC push her and encourage her full speed so she can be confiedent in herself and know how precious she is.

**-** The FMC end up with MMC trough a way that give all the power dynamic to him : payment of a debt, sold has cattle etc... This way, to her, the perspective of her future relationship with MMC is dreadfull at best.  
Exemple of what she could think : my choosen husband was beating the shit out of me so the guy who have me instead of his money will probably be even harsher with me, for every mistake. I must be perfect at all the time and pray hard that he will not find a fault if he is truly looking for one.

\- She end up taming MMC like horrible people are scared shitless of him and she call his bullshit without a care in the world. She can even appease his anger and outbrust.

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

I won't lie the bonuses make the trope A LOT more bearable as it's boderline dark. Bonus 3 and 4 are the most important to me :)

I tried the  [**Magic Search Button**](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Fromancebooks&oq=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Fromancebooks&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.1126j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)  but didn't find something with all the boxes checked especially on the very flinching sacred for long FMC.

18w50gn,Normal People,"I just finished reading this book called Normal People by Sally Rooney. I don't know how but a story about two teenagers from Ireland can ever be the most relatable thing to a Med student from India. 
With every line that I read , I found myself repeating those lines that I once thought of.
I don't think the story is pretty but do think that it is cruel.
It was a reflection of my teenage self that was buried deep inside me . That teenager who needed love and forgiveness, the teen who needs a apology. Connell was me , I was a Connell and so do Marianne was me , I was Marianne . 
I read this book at a certain point of my life when I needed answers , a lot of answers and this book gave me all of that .
Every paragraph of this book has so many layer of thoughts, beauty , reverence, complications with the real human world I can't recount all.

So a highly personally recommended book for y'all

sfqq7t,Normal People by Sally Rooney is overrated.,"I read the book because people on TikTok were absolutely obsessed with it. But as soon as I started it I was very disappointed. 

The way this book is written created an urge to put it down and never open it again. 

While Marianne was somewhat developed as a character, Connell was a plain nothing. 

Now to the most controversial part - the limited series came out so much better. Even though I didn’t quite like the book, I enjoyed watching the series. Characters were properly portrayed and the story finally made sense.

1adkcx6,Just Finished Normal People - Sally Rooney,"I just wrapped up Sally Rooney's ""Normal People,"" and I can't help but wonder if anyone else struggles to anticipate her endings. The journey through the book was nice, even though it started as reading too much like a YA novel. It matured gradually and grew on me. I just somehow didn't anticipate the open-ended conclusion. I expected it to have a clean-cut, simpler finish, being, in essence, a love story. 

It wasn't necessarily a negative thing, I appreciate the realism, but there's something about the ambiguity that makes it hard to come to terms with.

I can not stress enough how brilliant and emotional this book is while also being so normal that it feels like I'm reading the life of a very good friend. If I was to want to meet book characters Marianne and Connell would be top of the list. 

You simply want the absolute best for them both and that is each other but life gets in the way and they grow up in different social groups that's forever changing.

uqx796,Controversial take on 'Normal People' by Sally Rooney,"This is probably going to be a controversial opinion, but I find the book 'Normal People' by Sally Rooney to be an incredible disappointment. I would even say it is a prime example of the movie (show) being better than the book.

I stumbled upon the show by accident and fell in love. It was really good and beautifully made. Very emotionally captivating. It really got under my skin. Learning that it was based on a book, I picked up the book shortly after because I love reading. 

Maybe the magic of the story had faded after seeing the show (it is quite a cliché story after all), but I found the book not at all enjoyable. Rooney writes very plainly and she fails to offer insights in the psychology of the characters that seemed so complex and interesting in the show. The story suddenly felt rather flat and childish. 

I do not understand the appeal of the book at all. Anyone had the same experience?

&nbsp;  
Frankly, American society is fucked, and most Americans don't know it yet. A metaphor I find appropriate — it appears in the book as well, so perhaps it inspired me — is the story of the frog in a pot. The story goes that if the water in the pot is suddenly rapidly heated, the frog would jump out of the water immediately, but that if it is gradually raised over time, the frog would continually adjust until it's too late to flee, and it's thus boiled alive. America is that frog, the water is her economy, and the fire is automation.   
   
Eric Weinstein said:   
> No one ever thought that capitalism would get eaten by its son technology.  
  
That's where we're at now. In the US economy inequality is at [an all time high never before seen in US history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States) ([the richest 5% of Americans own two thirds of the wealth](https://inequality.org/facts/wealth-inequality/), and the trend is only worsening. We've automated away four million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2015, and by some estimates by 2030 we'll have automated away 45 million. This great displacement of workers from the work force could have catastrophic societal effects and is already wrecking society currently (suicide and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicular deaths as the chief causes of deaths in America. Life expectancy has declined for three years straight (last time this happened was the Spanish Flu in 1918, labour force participation rate is at 63% (comparable to Guatemala and El Salvator) and by almost all performance metrics, society is on a spiralling downward trend (Social unrest would only exacerbate as millions more are displaced from the work force, so it isn't getting better anytime soon)). Yet GDP, and the stock market prices are at record highs. For the vast majority of Americans, the economy isn't working for them.   
  
&nbsp;   
The book is split into three parts.  
   
Part 1: ""What's Happening to Jobs""  covers the changes happening to the job market. Several jobs (both blue collar and white collar, basically any repetitive work regardless cognitive or manual) are amenable to automation or replacement with artificial intelligence. These jobs are going and are not coming back. Unlike previous industrial revolutions, this one is different — History repeats itself until it doesn't. The invention of the self driving car is a different kind of invention from the invention of the automobile. For the first time in history we now have machines that can perform tasks that where exclusively the purview of humans in the past, and that's going to cause a permanent, radical shift in the job market. The fourth industrial revolution would create new jobs, but the jobs would be much fewer in number than the displaced jobs, may be in different locations, and would require vastly different skill sets. For every 100 jobs you displace with robots, you may create only 10 jobs servicing the robots, administering them, working on software, etc. The job market is undergoing a fundamental change, and the old market isn't coming back.    
   
&nbsp;   
Part 2: ""What's Happening to Us"" focuses on the relationship between humans and work. Voltaire said work keeps at bay 3 great evils: boredom, vice and need. Work provides structure to people's life. It fills them with a sense of purpose of belonging, and makes them feel valuable. For men in particular, unemployment is one of the worst things that can happen. Long term unemployment causes more unhappiness than the loss of a spouse or limb. Men who are unemployed volunteer less often than employed men, participate less in their communities, and generally become more antisocial. They end up succumbing to alcohol and drugs, and many take their own life. The problem Yang says is that humans need work, but work doesn't need us.    
   
In a world without jobs, if these needs are not met, society would continue it's downward spiral, and eventually violent outbreaks would occur. To prevent this, we would need to fundamentally rethink the social contract and how we intrinsically value ourselves when the market does not value us.    
>If revolution there must be it is better to undertake it than to undergo it.    
    
&nbsp;   
Part 3: ""Solutions and Human Capitalism"" presents a vision to move forward. In the first two parts of the book, Yang drives home the point that dystopia is our default, and that following the logic of the marketplace would drive us off a cliff. In this part he focuses on solutions that he believes can move us in the right direction.   
   
The first step is a proposal for universal basic income to handle at least the need provision of work and free up people to pursue more creative or entrepreneurial ventures that may be too risky in our society.   
   
The other major proposal, is a fundamental rethinking of our economy. As is, the economy doesn't serve humanity, humanity serves the economy and that's perverse. You achieve what you measure, so Yang proposes indexing economic well being by other statistics that more closely reflect the wellbeing of the average person than something like GDP (e.g quality adjusted life expectancy, childhood success rates, etc). Building on this, Yang proposes centering our economy around human welfare to form a new kind of capitalism which he calls human centered capitalism (or human capitalism for short). He goes into specific details of his human capitalism approach and paints an optimistic image of a bright future.      
   
&nbsp;

&nbsp;  
All in all, The War on Normal People was an amazing read. I think it's a must read for anyone who wants to keep apprised of the changes going on in our economy and society as a whole. It's available on Amazon (ebook and paper back), as an audiobook on audible and an audiobook on YouTube (where I read it). I am willing to answer any questions anyone has.

vwag1z,Normal People by Sally Rooney is OVERRATED!,"After reading tons of amazing reviews about this book, I started reading it with huge expectations. And oh boy, was I disappointed!

Firstly, both the characters are extremely unlikeable. It's hard to empathize with either of them as they come off as jerks every now and then. Neither did I resonate with them or the narrative. It's just pathetic to read about such shallow and unrealistic characters. The author was trying too hard to portray everyone in both of their lives in a negative light and romanticize their utterly toxic relationship.

Second, cliche. Two extremely smart, good-looking, intellectual people have sex and break up. (Totally normal\*eye roll\*). And of course, the guy is popular whereas the girl is a loner. They have similar friends with whom they attend parties , they go to an amazing college, and manage to get good grades because obviously, they're smart :)

os1bol,We need to talk about 'Normal People',"Normal People by Sally Rooney. A 'big, important, HBO-series worthy' book that I don't understand why I hate so much. I never hate books - it requires a lot of energy to do, that I usually shrug it off.  
I need your opinions guys. Below is my Goodreads review for reference.  
""Ok, so this book was rather hard for me to finish. I picked it up last year, read a few chapters, and put it away because it gave me a weird, disgusted feeling. I picked it again after few weeks and put it away again. And repeat. 

So my experience with this book is just like the main characters' relationship which is a proverbial 'on, off, on again dumpster fire'. 

I very rarely experience something like this with books.

It's hard for me to rate it too. On one hand, I think it's very realistic, even naturalistic, or ultrarealistic with how fucked up people are and how they behave, how they struggle with their feelings they can't express and how they hurt each other constantly. And it's a hard job to write about all that. On the other, I think this ultra-realism is very much unrealistic paradoxically, like a CGI monster or something. Yeah, people are fucked up but they can be kind too or nice sometimes, even unironically. The cynism of this book is really soul-crushing and I think this is the reason for the bad taste in my mouth and tingles in my muscles. I call it ultra-realism because it's not realism, it's real but cranked up to max. Like, I recognize people's behaviors and motifs but I never experienced them myself to that degree and I knew some really fucked up people. This book is like staring into the abyss and seeing the lowest of low of human behavior where even friendship and commitment and basic human decency is constantly challenged. And I hate that, because I managed to climb up from that abyss and it's a struggle to not fall down again and this book tried to do just that. 

Also, do college students really behave like that? Is it how it is really? This is how they talk? Because I went to secondary school and we were rather dorky in comparison. No parties, no sleeping with everyone around, no campus-wide drama etc. Boring but real. I like boring real more than fake realism though. 

Also, there's no arc. 

We don't really arrive anywhere, do we? The main characters don't really develop. They just flow through life and that's it. They make mistakes but they don't learn from them that much. And I can respect that, but why is there such a title as 'Normal People'? Because when I picked this book up I thought that we will arrive at some conclusion that in reality there are no 'normal people'. That normal is just some collection of ideas and expectations, the ideal we all strive for but can never reach. That we are all fucked up. The book keeps suggesting such a conclusion, but it just ends in a way I hate - just ends. Like if the writer just stopped writing. We don't arrive anywhere. Well, fuck you too I guess.  

I like one thing though, I liked that chapters switch point of view. Why no one thought about it before in a love story is beyond me (I can't remember any, anyway), but it's really interesting when you see the same events through different pairs of eyes and hear thoughts that stew inside the character's head. I like the dissonance it creates between what the character thinks and what he does or says. 

In the end, I thought that I will rate it how I feel because objectivism doesn't really exist and I don't care. So I think it's well written and I understand why it won awards but it's hard to read, soul-crushing, and gut-wrenching and I will never read it again.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/os1bol/we_need_to_talk_about_normal_people/,2021-07-26T15:40:57Z,53,76,books,Normal People,POST

Its well written, with strong dialogue and characters. However the story just left me frustrated and wanting it to just be over.

I frankly don't understand why every romance novel needs to be like this and would like some insight on why people love these stories so much. I don't think its wrong or bad to like them. I just genuinely don't understand.

117io6q,"What do you feel about ""Normal People"" by sallery Rooney?","Normal people. The most infuriating thing was that there were no inverted commas or any way that you could differentiate the direct and the indirect text 

Second, i just hated the fact that it was a simple story. It was written more in a ""slice of life"" manner but the written genre were romance/drama. 

Third, i hated how the timeline kept on switching. I mean one second the ml would be sitting in the garden thinking about what she did last summer at the beach. Then the scene would be like she would remember that one memory she remembered during her visit to that beach. I mean it got a little complicated at this point to even categorise what timeline was going on. 

Fourth, it bore me. The only interaction they had was out of lust. One was naive and other was horny. Both was horny. Both was bland. 

Fifth, i hated the reverse trope. I mean when he was famous and she was quiet girl. But then he's quite and she's famous. Idk. It's just, i hate it.

Sixth, i never really felt the romance. I was always caught up with how many story pieces were given. I can't even recall 30% of the incidents that happened. I simply don't remember them. 


I mean I've seen people lable it as the ""literature of this century"" ""one of the future classics"" i just don't get the hype. I've tried. Several times to reread it. But i am nothing but just bored.

10yu0s8,"Normal People, by Sally Rooney","2.75/5⭐️

I have mixed emotions.

The gist of the novel is about the communication struggles of two consenting adults entangled in a friends-with-benefits relationship while mutually dealing with past traumas.

Although I finished it in a day, I did not enjoy the book as much as I thought. I also think that it's significantly overrated.

The characters aren't that lovable, and the plot isn't that remarkable either. However, the book's realistic plot and the way that the characters interacted make it somehow special. I see readers feeling connected to the novel and sympathizing with the characters. But for me, I think it could be better. I would love to watch the series afterwards and reminisce the crucial moments from the book.

Overall, a normal reading experience

rbxfcq,"I'm in Love with ""Normal People"".","I can't type it into words.  
From the start until the end I was held by a gripping intensity. I love Salley Rooney's writing style. Her intellectualisms were a bit toned down in this book, just the right dose I say. The first part of the book, >!before they go to college!<is definitely my favorite, such a new concept for me to be honest. the rest of the book felt so good to read. I admire her non-linear storytelling and >!the journey from self-hate to self-love!<. 

This is a must read for everyone who experienced love and hate in relationships. It is a great peek into the distress of unfunctional & functional relationships. I'm in the process of recommending it to my whole circle of friends

upkg1p,normal people,"just finished reading Normal People by Sally Rooney. I had watched the series first to see if the book's not going to waste my time, and it did not. My god, I know I'm late with the craze but I'm literally staring at my ceiling now and can't process what to feel. I mean, what? The book gave me a lot of frustrations especially when both of them are talking becuase why can't they talk like real ADULTS? It's frustrating because it's how people really talk! It's how I know I will communicate and I can't accept that I need to accept that we, as normal people, should always sabotage ourselves 🙂 Good night.

17bai8q,Thought Hulu’s adaptation of Sally Rooney’s Normal People missed the mark,"Grain of salt as I’ve only finished a couple episodes.

I read Normal People earlier this summer. Thought it might not be my speed but was recommended it by a friend and absolutely adored it. 

The part about the book that I found most unique was Rooney’s ability to notice these subtleties and nuances that live in between the lines of human-to-human interaction (the way people breathe, the way their eyes move, what their fingers do while they talk) and express them in this very elegant, simple way. and beyond the physical stuff she's really in-tune with the miniature power struggles, the push and pull of 'love' (air quotes because it’s only loosely explored as such in the novel) and how this dynamic usually doesn't exactly simmer slowly and explode suddenly but rather teeters in a constant state of slight imbalance, little misunderstandings or insignificant interactions tilting it in one way one day and the other way the next. I found it very profound.

So far, the hulu adaptation misses the mark on what was special about the book to me. Marianne and Connell’s relationship is much more stiff and dialogue-driven than I imagined, lacking the nuance that Rooney seemed to indulge in very deeply in her writing. Overall it comes across like a much more standard ‘awkward love story’ without the human aspect that drew me to it initially.

Curious if anyone else has consumed both the book and the show and if they agree. Is it worth sticking with?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17bai8q/thought_hulus_adaptation_of_sally_rooneys_normal/,2023-10-19T04:20:50Z,7,0,books,Normal People,POST
12gsvjm,Normal People: Is it a true portrayal of Uni life?,"So I completed Normal People by Sally Rooney and I am not sure if I like it or hate it. However, definitely, I could not relate to it. 

The main duo seems to sleep with each other when they were friends, best friends, dating, and when they were dating other people too. Everyone in Uni seems to sleep with each other and be open about in their group as well. People changed partners even during the three-month year break. 

I come from a country far far away from Ireland (where the plot is set) and our Uni life seems really dull in comparison. This was a culture shock to me.

xjoawd,Some Brief Thoughts on Sally Rooney's Normal People,"I've had quite a bit of bad luck over the last few years with literary novels, which I do think has a lot to do with me primarily reading nonfiction and genre fiction over the last handful of years. Even literary novels that win awards or are up for awards tend to strike me as very flat or uneven or just incredibly empty.

But this is truly marvelous. It's probably the best literary novel I've read in years. There are a number of reasons for this, but Rooney never loses her characters or allows their story to spread beyond them. There are points where we think this might occur, where the novel will fan out into new territories where the world subsumes the characters. But instead of going down these obvious yet disastrous paths that so many novels go down, Rooney always pulls us back to Connell and Marianne.

She immediately opens her characters up in the novel and shows them in very vulnerable moments. It seems that a lot of novels don't do this, and I can see why, but I think Rooney demonstrates why this is a powerful route to take. By revealing and opening up these characters so much and so quickly, it allows Rooney to do incredibly subtle things with her character work. And this novel is really driven by the emotions of these two characters.

I've also never felt so much tension while reading a book before. I don't honestly know how to explain it. Anxiety is a very foreign feeling for me, but I felt so incredibly anxious during parts of this novel that it was almost nauseating. And it's not as if these were during big emotional fights or moments of violence - it would be at moments where Connell and Marianne are together but not talking, or where they are interacting but they're avoiding something deep and powerful between them. The immense emotional intensity pushed into such seemingly unimportant interactions is shocking to me. I don't know how Rooney did it, honestly, but it's one of the most powerful sensations I've ever had while reading.

But, yes, this is one of the best novels I've read in some time. It's a favorite for best of the year.

Definitely worth checking out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xjoawd/some_brief_thoughts_on_sally_rooneys_normal_people/,2022-09-20T23:35:14Z,13,35,books,Normal People,POST

nr8cri,NORMAL PEOPLE by Sally Rooney ( A REVIEW),"&#x200B;

Ratings: 4/5

*""Most people go through their whole lives, without ever really feeling close with anyone""*

I don't remember, the last time i finished a book in a day. I feel emotionally exhausted, and there is so much i want to say, but at the same time i am finding it difficult to write it down.

This book has a very *""Dark Academia aesthetic""* theme going on, and it's well constructed. Instead of glorification of the aesthetic, there is a very realistic approach to this. Rooney has mentioned topics such as burnout, depression, equating your self worth to your grades, imposter syndrome, and even normalising therapy and counselling to approach a healthier lifestyle.

While the plot is pretty much ""a chase"" there are moments of safety and vulnerability. There were times when i felt the characters were problematic, but its important to understand that Rooney wanted to display adolescence and relationships being experimental rather than reinforced at the ages of 17-21. It didn't feel, right out of ""a fairytale love story"", but rather a very realistic approach to a modern day relationships.

I respect this novel. Quite a lot actually, and there was several mentions of the very real life political issue, while being totally self aware of their position. Along with this Rooney has also referenced to a whole set of other books, which play a minor role in personality development of characters.

Sally Rooney's writing style, dismisses the idea of quotation marks, and although it was infuriating in the beginning, i felt that i had no room to have my own thoughts with this continuity. It was much easier to read and i was extremely pleased by the fact that in the end i trusted the author. I don't think i have ever read anything that lacked quotations, so this definitely opened up a new spectrum for me, especially now that i enjoyed this particular writing style.

Finally, id like to say that, amidst all the drama, and serious conversations between our characters, this book was annoyingly engaging and a serious page turner. And i enjoyed myself quite a lot.

Lastly, Thank you Sally Rooney,

For making me feel like a Normal Person.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nr8cri/normal_people_by_sally_rooney_a_review/,2021-06-03T08:22:18Z,25,39,books,Normal People,POST
tkpc4u,Unpopular opinion (?) Normal People,"I just finished Normal People by Sally Rooney and I came to Reddit to see how people were reacting to the ending. But I noticed a lot of the posts I read are about how C didn’t have depth (which I agree with to an extent). But his life was more simple than M’s so his character wasn’t as complex. His character was always someone that needed to be liked and wanted and we see how he doesn’t always get that from his relationship with M. Between the two of them I think he was more relatable because we see how much he cares for her but he doesn’t know how to handle or execute those feelings because he has a fear of rejection. 
The ending is frustrating though. I listened to this as an audiobook in one day because I was just waiting for these two to drop their walls and come together. I feel like the book could have ended with them just agreeing to be official (which they always struggled with) and him accepting her for her preferences (like he did).  Instead we see them finally get to a good place and then they push each other away again. Which maybe is the point, relationships and the people in them don’t always change and adapt. 
Side note the book could have been way shorter if they just communicated better!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tkpc4u/unpopular_opinion_normal_people/,2022-03-23T08:30:59Z,1,0,books,Normal People,POST
kdglex,Just finished reading Normal People,"So I finally got done reading Sally Rooney's Normal People. I'm not too sure whether I really like the book or don't like it at all. When I started reading it a couple of days back, the characters of Marianne and Connell immediately drew me in. Especially Marianne.

I think I identified with Marianne in her nonchalance about other people's opinions about her, negative or positive. But I didn't get her need to be submissive. With her dad and her brother being abusive towards her, you would think the last thing she would want is to be submissive. She would want to stand up for herself especially with how brilliant she is. Instead she actively seeks out men like Jamie and Lukas. 

Also even till the end why is she not clear where she stands with Connell. I mean I could tell from the very beginning that they were each other's comfort zone , they are entirely honest with each other and that kind of love doesn't change. But how is it that these two don't seem to get it? 

So even though I'm thinking a lot about the book and in that sense it is impacting me, I don't know if I like it or not. Would love to hear other perspectives about the book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kdglex/just_finished_reading_normal_people/,2020-12-15T06:39:24Z,12,18,books,Normal People,POST
b5cgwq,Normal People by Sally Rooney,"First time poster here, hello!

Hopefully the simplicity of this post doesn't violate any of the rules, apologies in advance if it does. 

I've been trying to coax myself into reading more contemporary fiction. I don't have a very large literary social circle, so I identify most future reads through journals, publications and newspapers. Normal People by Sally Rooney became ubiquitous across the sources that I follow closely and I recently decided to give it a go.

While I think the novel has its strengths, I have to say I was wholeheartedly underwhelmed by it. I'm a bit perplexed by the accolades and I have yet to come across anyone online that shares my opinion. Perhaps I'm missing something or completely overlooked some profundity in the text. I felt that it was a relatively forgettable romantic Bildungsroman featuring two fully-fleshed, yet uninspiring protagonists. 

I also recently read Milkman by Anna Burns, last year's Man Booker Prize winner. I researched the synopsis and style of both Milkman and Normal People and came to the conclusion that I would enjoy the latter more. Didn't turn out that way. I can say that while I was a bit apprehensive toward the density of Milkman, I thought it was absolutely brilliant and worthy of its lofty critical reception.

oqp8c1,Normal People by Sally Rooney,"I have just finished this Book, and the book has left me with some painful questions. 
One of them is that, why the author put up ""Sadie"" name in the last chapter. Where Marianne got irritated by the fact that Connell didn't told her about his applying for New York. 

My point is Marianne prop her name so many times, that its feel like she knows Connell like sadie, he just didn't know. And she is backing herself from him so he can be with the people he likes.

Though Connell resist that he didn't like sadie but it just feels odd for me that author put sadie name out of nowhere in the end of last chapter.

rcbqu7,Finished Normal People and Conversations With Friends each in 1 day,"I hear many people talking about how they don't understand the ""hype"" of Sally Rooney novels, this or that. I wanted to leave my brief two cents. (Mind you this is coming from someone who couldn't put either book down and finished them in 2 back to back days)

First of all, these book are extremely accessible. What I mean by this is that they are easy reads, enjoyable page turning novels. While they're not necessarily profound in any life altering way, they speak deeply to the soul and directly to the human conscious. I find myself enjoying more often than not, books with simple stories about the human condition-- books that relate to anyone in one way or another, and force you to do some introspection on yourself. Yes, these are simple stories about everyday people and everyday things. But Sally Rooney makes the mundane and monotonous experiences feel poetic. She lays out stories about finding your place in the world under the guise of modern day romances. She explores friendship and relationship dynamics in the twenty first century and shows us that life isn't always black and white- people weave in and out of your life and serve different purposes at different times. She shows us that we all still have growing up to do even after we've come of age. Most of all-- she reminds us that life has no beginning, middle, or end-- in the much the same way that these novels have no beginning, middle, or end. Much like real life, Sally Rooney novels are complex and simple, exhilarating and boring, grounding and transcendent, treacherous and fulfilling, normal and *not*.  

This is a rough paraphrase but I'll leave you with this comment that one of the Redscare podcasters made when talking about Sally Rooney novels-- **""We read these books not to transcend thyself but to remind ourselves of who we are.""**

t1crs3,Normal People by Sally Rooney- rant about a very pensive read.,"Hiii,

I read Normal People last month because I was on a weird obsession with Sally Rooney, I got into a lot of her other books as well, but after this one, I didn't quite enjoy the others. But nonetheless, it was a bit hard to get through this book because of the themes, and the self abusive behavior that takes place over the course. It's also a perfect representation of what relationships truly are in this day and world, and how the need for approval from society- an invisible being, but ever present- pushes some people to make certain decisions which end up scarring others the ones they say they love, but do they?

Anyway, here goes nothing:

Rating: 2 stars

LOVE-

* Marianne? Best girl, suffered too much, deserves so much more, genuinely wish life would've been so much nicer to her, she literally didn't do anything for the world to make her feel like a by-stander and even after which, life came for her over and over again in the forms like that of a mouth-breathing boy, horrible family members,  repulsive kids at high school(honestly every high school is the same) Loved the transition, and inner monologues of M- a character who was so deep it hurts. Even though some of her decisions were not the best, the reasoning and the outcomes were perfectly understandable. Props to the amazing writing that seemed to pull this off with literally ZERO plot.
* Connell's mom- what a sweetheart.
* The writing style
* The thoughtful proses, and situations
* The change in dynamic when C finally leaves high school and arrives in college feeling lonely and left out, and a lonely and left out M enters college having at least a few friends>!(even though all but one turn out as assholes in the end)!<\- ponder worthy.

HATE?

* >!Connell? Absolutely hate. Yes, he has the personality of a cabbage. So shallow that he's the size of a rain drop that falls in the ocean and evaporates immediately. Maybe even smaller. 0 depth. No matter how much he tries to defend his decisions, he's a pussy. He's a blank paper, becoming whatever the writer writes on him, a puppet whose strings are controlled by the society. He lets them, thinking that's how he can fit in.  Liar- lies to M over and over again, not realising the consequences of his lies. Insensitive and inconsiderate- when M tells him about how she thinks no one loves her, he thinks not of saying something he truly means, BUT of something vague and painfully cliche (his own words, not mine) hoping she would stop being dramatic???  ? ? ?  When M told him about her dad, how her dad hit her sometimes, even though she was downplaying it, he thought she was lying t o get his attention??? If he had even 1% of the personality that M had, or for once just said what he really wanted to say instead of saying what is supposed to to make him feel like he belongs, my hatred for him wouldn't have been so butchering. Selfish- the most selfish character I've ever read about, when M doesn't tell Jamie he's acting like a stuck-up moron, instead of telling it himself, he questions why M doesn't. He wished people wouldn't see him with M because he knew what they talked about her, but didn't have the balls to say he uses her as a fuck doll (which, I only realised after his mom brought it up, and then thought how manipulative his povs were. Great Writing)!<
* >!The ending??? The last chapter seemed to start off good, finally seeing some true intimate moments between M and C where we can at least hope for a future, where even though both parties are complex beings, they might work it out considering how much they feel for each out, however...leaving for NYC? out of nowhere??? It felt like SR didn't really know what to do with them after all that they'd been through. No matter what ending they got, it would've felt unrealistic. It felt very rushed in the later part of the book, trying to force a real connection that C might feel for M even though time and time again we've seen what a condescending bastard he is, who never quite grows out his thinking pattern, he thinks, up till the end, that M is not someone he's supposed to be with because of his need to fit in, that he'll never grow out of thinking the way he did when he was young even though he enjoys being with M, even though his early concerns was his friends in high school and now that he was out and no one to judge him he still continues thinking in the same vicious way about M. Even after he found out people didn't think of it as such a big deal as he did, that everything was in his head, he still couldn't mold himself into a semblance of a man who she deserved. Really wished it would've been a more happier ending, but I don't know if that would've been realistic in their situation. However, there definitely should've been proper closure at least. Very abrupt and off-hanging.!<
* >!Few themes were a bit disturbing to read, but nothing too bad. In fact, every theme discussed was highly thought provoking.!<
* >!Zero plot can come off as a bit of a boring book, but M's monologue were indeed interesting, and kept me curious as to where she would end up.!<
* >!Due to C, and M's forgiving reaction to C's mistakes, the book can definitely come off as toxic, but it's still bearable. I think M was at the point where she would've taken anything C gave her, even the rotten scraps, which makes it really sad to read about. Th e repeated no-confrontation on their real feelings, being vague and shrugging 95% of the time, I've come to realize, is an essential part of Sally's writing style, it never goes away in any of her books, so it does come off a bit harder in this books, can make it a lot frustrating to read, but again got with it due to M- her kindness was contagious and I was touched.!<

>!Overall, this book was very complex. Definitely not an entertaining read, and more on the educational and introspective side. SR is very perceptive, and expressive. The entire book felt like reading a tear jerking poem. Amazing writing, inner-monologues even though most of the time I didn't enjoy what I was reading because it was too ugly. But the plot was EXTREMELY basic. Sometimes you don't want to see/read about something so ugly even when you know its completely natural, SR does this brilliantly. Very descriptive explanation of feelings, while maintaining an aestheticism in the writing style. Makes me ponder about so many things, including, but not limited to: bullying, domestic abuse, fitting in with society, craving deep meaningful relationships, belonging somewhere(anywhere?), happiness, masochism, indifference, depression, anxiety, panic attacks and hyperventilation and the reasons behind them. Very emotional, loved how the book just progresses over bits and pieces of memories- like life is all about memories and nothing else in between, memories stitched up together to make up a patchy dress of varying colors based on the feelings behind the memory. I hated it a lot of the time, wanting to stop at numerous occasions as I felt too helpless reading about how helpless M was feeling all the time(What made me pick it up again is how much I resonate with M on multiple levels, I wanted to know where/how she would end up); how M felt like a hollow being with nothing more than her body connecting her to the real world, while she watched it happen outside of it; how she had to mold her expressions, and control what she said around her household so as to not instigate an argument-ultimately modeling her into who she is currently; how extreme loneliness and lack of proper connection pushed M to end up choosing domination as a form of love- she became a masochist, slowly losing every hope and idea of what real love is, or even who she is, and the extent to which what she's ready to do to feel some kind of connection. ""There’s always been something inside her that men have wanted to dominate, and their desire for domination can look so much like attraction, even love.""  Heartbreaking.!<

>!M's whole life she is told she doesn't have warmth in her because she doesn't beg for the love of someone who doesn't give it to her, she is unlovable because of that; and sometimes if you tell a kid/ anyone for that matter something too many times, they start to believe it's true until its the only truth they know, the truth tied to the fundament core of their being- change it, and it might cause the entire system to tip over.  All in all, M is very inspiring  at times due to her lack of concern for what society thinks of her, the way she treated C with kindness over and over again even after his shit shows of throwing her under the bus every single time, I liked her a lot, SR made me feel everything M felt, and frustrated for not being able to make her feel ok. A very melancholic read.!<

Some quotes I vibed with a little too much:

""Life is the thing you bring with you inside your own head.""

""No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.""

""Generally I find men are a lot more concerned with limiting the freedoms of women than exercising personal freedom for themselves.""

""It was culture as class performance, literature fetishised for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterwards feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about.""

""Not for the first time Marianne thinks cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently. You learn nothing very profound about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can never forget.""

""All these years, they’ve been like two little plants sharing the same plot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions.""

""I' m not a religious person but I do sometimes think God made you for me. ""

""If people appeared to behave pointlessly in grief, it was only because human life was pointless, and this was the truth that grief revealed.""

""I don't know what's wrong with me, says Marianne. I don't know why I can't be like normal people.""

iyj9xv,I just finished Normal People,"What a beautifully written and observed story. It connected with me on so many different levels. I wrote a little stream of consciousness review to get a few of my thoughts on it in order and to use as a springboard if anyone wants to talk about it:

'Sally Rooney's 2018 romantic coming-of-age drama follows two lovers from the beginning of their relationship to what could be considered the end. Connell Waldron's story is in large part one of coping with anxiety. Particularly in college, during the book's first handful of chapters, Connell is near-crippled by other's opinions of him, an affliction that causes him to sacrifice not only his own happiness but that of the people around him. It takes Connell much of the book to become comfortable with his effect on the world around him, an internal struggle that is set up with a quiet elegance at the end of the novel's first chapter with the line 'He stares out the windshield and pretends not to see'. Whether or not he does this out of genuine ignorance on his effects on other people or because choosing to ignore those effects is more convenient, it is clear that he makes a conscious effort to nullify himself: he speaks in non-committal mumblings and the sparse writing style creates the impression that eye contact from him is rare. It is no wonder that Marianne Sheridan, whose mother employs Connell's as a cleaner, sees him as a mystery. Marianne 's affliction is the opposite to Connell's: where he cares so much about other's opinions of him so that he doesn't have to form his own, Marianne is at times despised and at others admired by her schoolmates, and neither reactions have much effect on her. All that matters is how she sees herself. And she hates herself. It is clear the words of her brother (and likely her late father) have echoed through her mind so long she's forgotten their points of origin; that she is disgusting, worthless, a freak, high-and-mighty, nasty, spoilt, unsociable, perverted. Marianne may not truly believe these things, but they hang over her all through her formative years. These issues impede Marianne and Connell's relationship time and time again - Connell keeps his relationship with Marianne a secret and leaves her at university because he's too afraid to ask to live with her, both damaging her self-esteem. Marianne chooses men she doesn't respect and allows them to disrespect her, her poor self-image allowing her nothing more, thus keeping Connell at arms length. 

Their undying attraction is strong enough to survive these roadblocks, however, and the two allow each-other to grow into far healthier, more self-assured people. By the book's end, Connell is displaying more confidence than ever, and Marianne has rid herself of her chronic loneliness so effectively that she can encourage Connell to take his own path in life, comfortable knowing that the person she's become is as much Connell as it is her, and vice-versa, and they'll be together forever within one another, regardless of physical distance.

Class plays a large role throughout the novel, Rooney observing it's influence with a keen eye. Connell's working-class background contributing to his anxiety and Marianne's affluence masking a coldly abusive family. While mention is made of Connell's material deprivation, the effects of class are shown more subtly on an emotional level. A small moment early in the novel features Connell's mother asking if he'd threatened Marianne to keep quiet about their relationship, the kind of question that could only have come from a woman with heavy experience of violent men in and out of prison rather than Connell's timid, sensitive personality. This kind of accusation, possibly repeated in different shapes and forms throughout his childhood, may have contributed to Connell's fear of his effect on the world, of his power over Marianne.

Rooney's writing style is short and blunt, reminiscent of the work of Cormac McCarthy, an influence made clear in the lack of speech marks to delineate dialogue. As a result the story has a sense of urgency that propels the reader and heightens the emotion by allowing the reader to fill in the blanks. Every now and then Rooney will uncharacteristically over-describe or clarify an action in a way that breaks the novel's otherwise flowing sense of confidence, but these moments are few and far between and hardly dampen the experience. The emotional subtext laden in every interaction is so potent and relatable that only a few lines of description are needed to completely immerse the reader in the moment. The aforementioned lack of speech marks also contributes to the piece's overall message: that no one can ever be independent of other people, so why not give up the attempt and go running in the other direction?'",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iyj9xv/i_just_finished_normal_people/,2020-09-23T21:12:30Z,8,28,books,Normal People,POST
gfd9uf,Thoughts on Normal People by Sally Rooney? (I couldn't finish it),"(Not criticizing anyone if they like this book).  
I decided to check out Normal People by Sally Rooney after hearing about the hulu series. The summary sounded interesting but the book got generally mixed reviews. While I've read worse books this is the first book I got a refund for. I thought the story was repetitive, really didn't like the writing style (seriously USE QUOTATION MARKS!!!!), and the characters just weren't interesting. I honestly felt somewhat bad DNFing (???) this one because it's so short, but at a certain point I realized it wasn't worth continuing. What did you guys think of this book?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gfd9uf/thoughts_on_normal_people_by_sally_rooney_i/,2020-05-07T19:24:45Z,30,23,books,Normal People,POST
hd9rlm,Romanticizing abuse in Normal People,"It's another *Normal People* post! I've just finished reading this book (haven't yet watched the series), and there's a lot of it that I found really insightful and enjoyable to read. Rooney's commentary on social capital, on the necessity of human connection, and even her claim that people, in some ways, only read books in order to appear more cultured, were all lovely points. However, I was left feeling confused about her viewpoints on abuse. Abuse was clearly a running theme throughout the story, and I'm not sure what to make of it. All of the men in Marianne's life who physically abused her were framed as antagonists, so one may say that Rooney is by no means romanticizing abuse. However, while Connell does not (importantly) ever hit her, he very obviously gets off on the idea of having control over Marianne. I think Rooney's point was maybe that this control is mutual, that it goes both ways, but I still found it really troubling that Marianne--who has a history of being abused by men--is so clearly left in a position of submission to Connell. The last line is pure submission--go off and do whatever you want, Connell; I'll be here for you when you get back. I don't know. I honestly feel like there's a turning point in the book that I'm missing. Any thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hd9rlm/romanticizing_abuse_in_normal_people/,2020-06-21T16:29:11Z,11,17,books,Normal People,POST
gi72uj,Sally Rooney: Normal people (book& tv series thoughts),"I just binge watched the show and read the book a day later in one sitting so it's safe to say I'm emotionally drained. I think that the book is very entertaining, straight to the point (definitely no filler pages) brutally honest and realistic for a romance story. The characters are definitely very complex. 

However, it left me feeling somewhat uneasy compared to the tv series which I thought was absolutely beautiful and a lot less dark. Connor's tv character was quite accurate to the book while to me, Marianne was far more troubled in the book than in the series. Not sure if that was intentional or if it just came across that way to me since there is no narration and direct insight into their thoughts like in the book.

For one, the book heavily implies that she has some kind of an eating disorder, which the series leaves out. Her relationship with Peggy is a lot more toxic since she gaslights Marianne about her relationship with Jamie and enjoys her misery. Then there's the whole submission sex thing and unusual power dynamic between them. The book says that he knew how to give her what she wanted, to leave her open, weak, powerless, sometimes crying after sex. The way I understood it is that that's not something she actually likes but rather something that stems from her conviction that she deserves to feel degraded and awful since she's inherently a bad person. That would make sense given her  psychologically abusive family who kept assuring her that she is unlovable and worthless. I get that people are different but that seriously shouldn't be anyone's ""version"" of normalcy. That and and being willingly so dependent on someone and in their power seems extremely unhealthy. While Connor clearly loves her, would never physically hurt her and cares about her well being, he is also very much aware of his power over her and ""has never been able to reconcile himself to the idea of losing this hold over her, like a key to an empty property, left available for future use"", which is unsettling to me. While they both definitely brought each other goodness, she still lacks an inner life that doesn't include him. That part made me especially miserable to think about. From this perspective I think the show handled the ending much better because it seemed like they were giving each other an opportunity to work on their problems seperately and maybe meet again in the future. In the book she says that she finally believes him when he says he loves her but right after that she seems to think it's completely possible and unsurprising that he would suddenly be in love with some other random girl he never showed any affection for. That doesn't seem like character development to me at all and I think it's why they left it out in the series. She is still insecure and seems to think that she is easily replaceable for him and thet their romantic relationship is fragile even though they share a connection neither of them have (or will ever have) with anyone else.

Overall, the book left me feeling... non cathartic and sad. I sure hope there will be a sequel since I see a lot of potential character development for both of them. I should maybe note that I've never been in love or in a relationship. I'm saying that because I'd love for anyone with more experience share their thoughts and point out if they think I misinterpreted or missed anything. I'm also not trying to dictate what the novel's message *should* be, simply sharing my feelings and looking for other people's interpretations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gi72uj/sally_rooney_normal_people_book_tv_series_thoughts/,2020-05-12T08:18:33Z,18,36,books,Normal People,POST
j98c8z,I just read Normal People. *Spoilers*,"Due to all the hype around Normal People, it feels like it was released ages ago and that I am super late to the train- but I've finally read it. 

It was one of those books where I couldn't really make up my mind about whether I liked it or not until I was nearing the end. At first it seemed like a simple love story between two students but then it verged into this character study of young adults from different classes and home lives- sometimes I was frustrated, mainly because of Marianne's passivity (I know it's due to her home life I was just frustrated for her rather than at her) and the main characters' being unable to communicate. The part when they break up after Connell tries to mention that he won't have a place to stay in the summer- she acts cold (in his view) so he doesn't mention wanting to stay with her and it ends with him asking whether they should see other people based on his assumption that she wants to?? It was tiresome and painful but maybe that was the point... I definitely felt the emotional fluctuations between comfort and anxiety that they were caught up in both personally and romantically. 

As I neared the last chapters though I did start to understand the merit of this book, Sally Rooney does a good job of deconstructing on and off relationships, class tensions, feeling lost and lonely and awkward in your teen years and beyond at university. The ending was especially bittersweet and melancholic, although my family life is (thankfully) different from Marianne's I related to the helplessly sad place she often found herself in, that ending really encapsulates their relationship I think- with her waiting for him and willing to sacrifice for him, and her insecurity about his love for her (though he also was also a good partner at the end imo, he grew from his high-school years). 

I won't say it was as brilliant as everyone made it out to be, maybe I would have found it better if there wasn't a crazy amount of hype leading up to me finally reading it? I do really like it and I can see myself rereading this. What did you guys think? Was it a little overhyped or was it perfect and well-deserved? Did you care for the characters and worry for them?

gppibn,I just finished reading Normal People by Sally Rooney,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I really liked the prose, the characters were very fitting, some of the mistakes they make are relatable because I've been there. That said, sometimes the author does take it a bit overboard tho, that one event about Conell being depressed because some guy he barely knows killed himself. I guess he was building up to that depression and that was the trigger but still felt like it could've been done better. I also don't get WHY Marianne's brother hates her. And sometimes, the author would insert a completely ideological viewpoint that felt forced but it still fit the characters that presented it so that's alright. I feel like even after finishing the story, I don't really understand the two main characters fully. Their personalities are very chaotic, impulsive and difficult to pin down and nothing much happened in the book really. I guess it fits the title. It felt like a slice of life anime tbh lol, I enjoyed it a lot tho, particularly because I'm in the same age group as the characters I guess. I don't think it deserves as much praise as it gets but it is good.

hrhtsu,I Finally Read Sally Rooney's Normal People,"I know there's some discussions already about *Normal People*, but I want to start a fresh one. 

Given all the amazing reviews it got and the Hulu deal as well, perhaps my expectations were too high. Some of the prose was nice but a lot of it felt as if it lacked flow. The standout lines were a bit too cliche for my taste. To be fair, I finished the novel in two days, but by the end of it I was getting tired of the themes of submission and ownership. It felt like it was trying too hard to be significant.

Am I the only one who feels this way? I know people love this novel, and I myself was at first drawn in by the story, but I think it fell short. Open to discussion! How did you feel about it?

dicaec,Sally Rooney : Normal People,"This book really personal cord for me. I found myself being totally sucked into the story and their world as if I was apart of it. 

Although I enjoyed it so much, and was glued to every page, I found myself getting slightly anxious while I was reading it. I would have to find little moments to catch my breath before I continued reading. I think this was because she was able to make their worlds entirely relatable so I kept imaging myself in the characters situation. Although I don’t enjoy the fact that a book can make me feel anxious, I love it because a book has never captured my attention like this. 

Initially, I was slightly disappointed with the ending...After reflecting on it, I do think it was the most realistic and captured that dilemma of ‘opportunity vs love’ a lot of young relationships contend with. 

Would love to hear if anyone else got this anxious feeling while reading it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dicaec/sally_rooney_normal_people/,2019-10-15T18:40:55Z,10,14,books,Normal People,POST

I just finished Conversations With Friends last night, after reading Normal People a few months ago. I loved Normal People, I thought it was so interesting and I hadn't really read anything with that kind of style before.

But...I was shocked at the similarity between the two books. Even including a Marianne, who also went to Trinity!? For a minute I thought that maybe it was a crossover sort of thing but there's no mention of any Andrew (her BF) in Normal People, so I assumed not.

ghdihi,Just finished Normal People - anyone else feel it ends a chapter too early?,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book immensely and found the characters extremely relatable (maybe because I was an honors student myself - but never felt smarter than anyone else). Their relationship was refreshing in the raw emotion - the pain and the occasional moments of pleasure it shows. That's what most people remember about intimate experiences I believe - specific little moments. But back to my main point, the book doesn't provide real closure, instead its like the author asks the reader to decide what happened next for themselves.  Its fine I guess, I don't have to know how Marianne's and Connell's story ends. After all, a lot of real life relationships just end in a flicker, not a dramatic way and everyone probably has people that they'll never see again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ghdihi/just_finished_normal_people_anyone_else_feel_it/,2020-05-11T00:52:17Z,24,31,books,Normal People,POST
l9tbmf,i'm so late to this book but: Normal People by Sally Rooney,"*“They’ve been like two little plants sharing the same plot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions.”*

**Synopsis**

One of my favorite books I’ve read in the past year, *Normal People* by Sally Rooney explores the intricacies of how humans help shape one another. Throughout its plot, we follow friends/lovers Marianne and Connell from the time they’re 17 to 22 years old as they go through cycles of being drawn together and driven apart. 

Both are gifted intellects who share the feeling of being an outsider. Connected by their understanding of one another, Marianne and Connell constantly teach, validate, and influence one another; just as often, they willingly submit to the other and make choices that create contradictions for them on an individual level. 

**Readings**

This ebb and flow of power between people who are attracted to one another is an incredibly real dynamic, and serves as the choreography of Marianne and Connell’s relationship. 

I'd go so far as to say this exchange of power is, quite literally, the core of our most definitive relationships - it fosters growth, adaptability, empathy, and understanding of what we value and how we love. Surprisingly, it is not too often such a prominent theme we find in a piece of young adult fiction - a genre who likely owes its entire existence to the theme of defining one's self. 

I think I’m used to books that follow a certain path when it comes to love interests. Usually, a main character has to overcome whatever hurdles they’re up against, then they commit to whoever they’re romantically into at the end once their other stuff has been settled. Simply put: They figure themselves out, and the prize is getting to be in love.

But for Normal People's plot, author Sally Rooney structured it so that Marianne and Connell get together and *then* their individual conflicts begin unfolding. They lean on one another, growing simultaneously and individually, even at points in their lives where they’re just friends and nothing more, allowing us to see, appreciate, and learn from their dynamic.

The former structure suggests the whole ""you have to love yourself before you love another"" idea, which I find problematic because, sadly, not everyone is nurtured to know how to love themselves; Marianne’s character serves example to this. 

Which is why I love Normal People: its structure and characters demonstrate that being in an intimate relationship can actually **help** us learn how to love ourselves. They also help us accept that we’re worthy of being loved and that our individual struggles don’t need to be solo missions. Marianne and Connell help each other in these ways. And in doing so, they help one other grow into stronger people. 

*“He brought her goodness like a gift and now it belongs to her. Meanwhile his life opens out before him in all directions at once. They’ve done a lot of good for each other. Really, she thinks, really. People can change one another.”*

njxfts,"Is it normal to view reading as a chore, even if you enjoy the book? I don’t get how some people can read an entire book in one plane flight.

I guess it’s a very similar experience to watching a TV show on Netflix — some people can binge whole seasons in one day; I can only sit through like 3, or maximum 4 episodes, per day even if I’m addicted to the show. At that point, mentally I’m pretty fried.

To those of you who read a lot — at which point do you generally start to feel exhausted by reading? The 1-hour mark? 1.5? 2? 4? Etc.

I’ve also heard that your reading tolerance is a muscle — that the more you read and build a tolerance to the exhaustion, the less easily you’ll find yourself exhausted (i.e. the muscle will grow).

Even as a kid in Elementary School (with normal sleeping habits), I remember enjoying good books, but being left mentally exhausted after reading for like an hour (which we were forced to record onto a sheet, signed daily by our parents, for daily school homework).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/njxfts/is_it_normal_to_view_reading_as_a_chore_even_if/,2021-05-24T13:01:19Z,174,324,books,Normal People,POST

lgpgt4,"Songs that make me think of Normal People, by Sally Rooney","Hey so these two songs remind me a lot of Normal People, by Sally Rooney, and I was wondering if you guys maybe agree :)

**Cardigan by Taylor Swift**

*""And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed, you put me on and said I was your favorite""*

In the book, the first time Connell tells Marianne he loves her, it says that “She has never believed herself fit to be loved by any person. But now she has a new life, of which this is the first moment, and even after many years have passed she will still think: Yes, that was it, the beginning of my life”

""*Vintage tee, brand new phone""*

Their Socioeconomic differences: Connell is the vintage tee and Marianne is a brand new phone.

*""High heels on cobblestones... Sequin smile, black lipstick Sensual politics""*

Classic Marianne: ""came to college and got pretty"".

*""When you are young they assume you know nothing""*

Everyone from Marianne's life had looked down on her at the beginning. Even though she was the smartest student (other than Connell), her family and high school classmates continued to belittle and mock her.

""*A friend to all is a friend to none. Chase two girls, lose the one.""*

Connell was always popular in high school, but he later says that he never ""clicked"" with any of them. He was in a relationship with Marianne for months and then proceeded to ask Rachel to the dance, which was the last straw for Marianne.

*""To kiss in cars and downtown bars was all we needed""*

That perfect point in their lives during college before they broke up because of their inability to effectively communicate with each other.

*""Leaving like a father,""*

Connell's dad hasn't been a part of his life.

*""Chasing shadows in the grocery line""*

When Marianne comes back home and they unexpectedly meet in the grocery store

**Strawberry Blonde by Mitski**

Okay, honestly only some of the lyrics of this song really make me think of Marianne and Connell's relationship, but I think the song works better thematically. The melody is kind of Gaelic and reminds me of rolling hills in a small town in Ireland. I imagine the song coming from Marrianne's perspective at different moments in their relationship.

*""When you stood up, walked away barefoot, and the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape, I looked over it and I ached""*

Connell, in the beginning, continued to walk away from her making her feel like there was no place in his life for her, but still the imprint of his life on her's remained (and obviously vise versa, but I'm thinking from Marianne's perspective).

*""I don't need the city and I don't need the proof. All I need darling is a life in your shape, I picture it, soft, and I ache""*

Connell never proved to her when they were young that he loved her. She let him ignore her at school, because she loved him, but not herself. When he didn't invite her to the dance we see how much she truly craved to be a real part of his life, but he never let her.

*""Look at you strawberry blonde.""*

Connell isn't strawberry blonde, but to me it's more of the idea of seeing someone as perfect: Although she outwardly rejected the idea of conforming to her peers expectations of ""normal"", this didn't come from a place of self assuredness, rather it was a defense mechanism to keep herself from getting hurt (""reject them, before they can reject you"" mentality). She really wanted to be loved and accepted, but didn't think she was good enough. She longed to be a part of his ""strawberry blonde"" world.

Then in the second part of the song I think about that time when they were in college.

*""Reach out the car window, trying to hold the wind.""*

Marianne feels like she is trying to hold the wind every time they get back together only to break up. Their relationship is ungraspable and unstoppable, it couldn't be contained. It came and went like the wind.

*""You tell me you love her, I give you a grin. All I ever wanted was a life in your shape, so I follow the white lines, follow the white lines, keep my eyes on the road as I ache""*

Connell tells her that he loves Helen, and it breaks her heart, but she won't step out of line to reclaim him in any way. She just grins and lets her heart break.

&#x200B;

Yep that's it!

ficlo2,Normal People by Sally Rooney devastatingly broke my heart... and I loved it,"I have seen mixed reviews for the novel, but I personally found it unbelievably profound in its emotional honesty and complexity. Rooney conveys the complicated and often contradictory emotions people feel through her detailed descriptions. Rather then blatantly state how the characters feel, she reveals it through implications and dialogue.

The whole story has so paragraphs that I had to stop reading and just... absorb. Connel and Marianne are flawed, but real. I can’t help but caught up in there changing relationship and experience their feelings. Rooney absolutely nails anxiety- I knew that was apart of Connell life before it was revealed. I could honestly spend hours dissecting all the characters and their actions. This book has so much to unpack!

Personally, I view the ending as hopeful and romantic. I think Connel and Marianne, albeit still flawed, grew a lot as individuals and a couple.

jyarwy,Has anyone else read Normal People and deeply related to Connell?,"
I relate to Connell from Normal People so much that it’s scary. I’m maybe less aloof and more outgoing, but only really at the surface level; I hide what I’m feeling at all times because I’m scared of how people will judge me, never confront anyone or anything I’m feeling in any big way, and it leads me to be an anxious, depressed mess inwardly, making stupid decisions based on how I imagine people will perceive what I’m doing and constantly trying to please everyone, only really standing up for what I believe in when things go way too far and I’m pushed to it. Funnily enough, I think this is what makes me have an interest in writing like him too; it allows me to express how I really feel when I can’t bring myself to do it in my real life at all.

Just like Connell, my friends from high school are just kind of out of necessity. We have a good enough time together, but I have kind of fundamental issues with the way they treat/talk about women sometimes, their political beliefs, etc., but like he says in therapy, when you’re growing up none of that really matters. The more I grow older though, the more important those differences become to me and I feel kind of distanced from those friends, because I can’t condone how they act, even if I do have a soft spot for them still (I’d be devastated if anything happened to them like happens in the show). I’d never have the courage to confront them over anything, but I make it clear to them sometimes I don’t agree with the shit they’re saying. I’m the only one out of them to go to university, which earned me a lot of teasing, but even university didn’t help; I’m very working class, and I struggled to relate to people at university for totally different reasons, and made no more than a couple of friendly acquaintances while there. I felt like people were just really pretentious and fake for the most part. I might agree with them more on fundamental issues, but I don’t relate to their life experience like I do with my high school friends.

The only massive difference is there’s no Marianne in my life, a girl like her would probably be exactly my type though, but I just know if I’d been in Connell’s situation I would have regrettably treated her the same bad way he did, being too scared of what my friends would think to be open about how I feel. Funnily enough I have a best friend who’s a lot like her. Comes from money, shares my beliefs, I can be myself around her in a way I just can’t around my ‘friends’, etc. She flourished at university, whereas it just made me feel more and more lonely.

1ad7nnu,Is it normal to forget things about books you read two or more years ago?,"I mean I know it’s very common to forget details and minor characters etc. but I realised I don’t remember things about some books I read in 2022 and even a few which I read just last year. And I barely remember anything about books I read more than four years ago except the overall plot and general idea, no matter how much I loved reading it back then. Maybe it’s because of how I was younger and reading things more mindlessly but this gives me a feeling of uncomfortableness as if I can’t count these books as finished and I'm being a liar when I say so. I obviously can’t read them again when there are so many books to read and not enough time. It’s not applicable to all of my books, there are some certain books that I will always remember due to the effect they had on me but I was curious to see if there are people like me or how common is it. It kind of stresses me lol, maybe it’s time for me to start B-12 supplements.

miowp8,"How We Remember and Why We Forget. I’m Lisa Genova, neuroscientist and author of novels like Still Alice and Every Note Played. I recently wrote my first nonfiction book, REMEMBER, to explain how memory works and why most of what we forget everyday is totally normal. Ask me anything.","I've been talking about Alzheimer's and memory for over a decade, and everyone over 40 is pretty much freaked out about what and how much they forget every day. Many are convinced they are already on the road to dementia. But forgetting most often isn't a sign of disease, aging, or a failure of character. It's a normal part of being human, a product of how our brains have evolved. Our brains are not designed to remember people’s names, to do something later, or to catalog everything we encounter. These imperfections are simply the factory settings. But we tend to lay a lot of judgment, fear, shame, and stress on ourselves every time we forget to take out the trash or can't remember the name of that a friend recommended, and we're unfairly punishing ourselves here.
 
 - Where did I put my phone, my keys, my glasses, my car?
 - Oh, what's his name?
 - Why did I come in this room?
 - I forgot to remember to buy eggs
 
These are all super common and TOTALLY NORMAL kinds of forgetting. I want to normalize and humanize forgetting, to help people understand why these memory failures happen so they can relax, stop shaming themselves, and have a better relationship with their memory. Memory is an amazing superpower, but it's also a bit of a dunce. I think we can take memory seriously, but hold it lightly.
 
While REMEMBER contains strategies and tips for improving and protecting your memory, the real intention of this book is to provide you with insight as to how memory works—and why you forgot to attend your 4:00 Zoom meeting.

odhdjf,"I see so much of myself in the characterisation of Normal People (by Sally Rooney), and it hurts.","I guess Normal People isn’t everyone’s thing, and perhaps it takes knowing a specific type of turmoil to appreciate and even understand the inner and outer dialogues within and between Connell and Marianne. 

In the many ways that Connell and Marianne find themselves fragmented as abnormally normal people, I see so much of their characterisation in myself. Connell’s need to belong somewhere, always unable to find happiness even in the best of places, even the parts where he would lie on the floor because the depression felt too heavy on his bones to move. Marianne’s loneliness, the way she seems like she’s just giving into the cruelty of the world, the not eating to feel a little less, the general disillusionment and disinterest. 

And especially Connell’s (not so) subtle insecurities. And most Marianne’s proclivity towards being hurt, because there just seems to be no other way for a fractured person to feel deserving of an ideal world, than to be treated like you genuinely don’t deserve to be here (in this aspect, I don’t see Marianne as a masochist; at least for me, I identify with her thoughts — based on deeply personal experiences — where it comes from a place of an immense amount of pain). Her relationships with Lukas and Jamie, the callousness and cruelty that they inflict upon her, and her subjecting herself to it, they resemble my own. The disgust and disdain she has for herself because of it, and yet the way she falls back into it (as if she had wanted it, when in fact is vastly from feeling like she deserved it) all over again, and losing more and more of herself in the same way she lost her weight. 

Recently I’ve been struggling quite heavily with the discomforts of deep trauma, and the multitudes of self-hate, self-blame, resentment, despair, and helplessness that come with. Nothing I’ve been doing has helped me in coming to terms with my own pain. So it was incredibly sobering, painful and uncomfortable to have read this book, and relenting to it holding up a mirror to the confusion and qualities that I’ve been using for so long to explain away why I could only ever exist as a bad, vile person. 

But as raw as it felt to observe the ugliest parts of the characters (as well as myself) through reading the book, it was also somewhat cathartic for me. That’s because, somewhere amid the middle to last page of the book, I started learning how to grieve for myself and my body too. 

Aight, I’m gonna go cry at nothing in particular now and probably not read another book for a long while. And also marvel at the intricate and incredibly nuanced characterisations by Sally Rooney in the way she breathes life into what it means for us to be normal people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/odhdjf/i_see_so_much_of_myself_in_the_characterisation/,2021-07-04T09:57:42Z,5,34,books,Normal People,POST
bshys8,Review of Normal People by Sally Rooney,"""You should go, She says. I'll always be here. You know that.""

Normal People is the story of Marianne and Connell, it tells us how they learn to love, live, grow. It tells us how they become dependent, yet still independent of each other. It tells us how they become each others anchor and support system in a world that is always chaotic and changing.

Normal People accomplishes this by giving us glimpses of there lives over the course of 6 years, omitting much of the time they are apart and relying on exposition from the characters to each other to fill in the gaps.

""People can really change one and another""

What I found particularly unique and satisfying about this book was how the characters find growth and build their character with each other's help not by strident independence and individuality like so many coming of age books like to push. We live in a society, we have friends, and family that help shape us and it nice to see that reflected here.

Neither protagonist is perfect. The are works in progress, and we get a real sense of growth and development throughout the book along with the stumbles and mistakes.

I found Sally Rooney's wrting to be very engaging and had a real sense of propulsion and forward momentum that made this book impossible to put down. I HIGHLY recommend Normal People.

iq0zuy,Do you feel like the characters grew in Normal People? And did they have depth?,"I did enjoy the book, but my main enjoyment came from her writing style and descriptions. The line 'People really can change one another' near the end of the book confused me a little, because I'm not really sure how they changed each other. They obviously altered the events that happened in each other's lives, but I don't know how they changed each other internally, and if I'm being perfectly honest I don't see that much growth in either character over the course of the novel. I felt they allowed different sides of each other to be expressed when together, but I dont think this is the same as changing. 
I might just be a bit dense and unperceptive though so if anyone could provide me with a character analysis / arc that would be appreciated. 

Also when reading people's opinions online, there seems to be a divide in opinion between people who think the book is a great character study, and people who think the characters are undeveloped and basic. What do you guys think and why? I guess my personal opinion is that she's done a really good job at drawing out characters that you can empathise with on a deep level - you really do feel their pain. But I am kind of torn on whether that means they are developed / complex characters, I'm not sure why but even though I felt like I 'got' both characters, it felt there was something lacking in their motivations? I'm not sure if that's exactly the right way to describe it, because I'm pretty sure like for any given event in the book I could provide an explanation for why the characters were acting / feeling how they were, but I dont know why but something feels lacking to me.

y1cuh1,"The hidden transphobia in ""The Art of Being Normal""","*The Art of Being Normal* claims to be a book about the experience of transgender children, and the author worked in the Gender Identity Development Service with many people struggling with their gender identity. From the way that the novel is written, it seems like she has a baseline knowledge of transgender experiences, but it is clear that her knowledge is all second hand.

The book overall tells a good story, even from a representational perspective, but it contains many flawed ideas surrounding trans people and these can be harmful to those who don't already know that they are harmful. The two main characters are a trans guy called Leo and a trans girl called Kate, but both of these characters misgender one another and reference one another using transphobic language at several points. Kate comes out to Leo in the middle of the book, but he continues to deadname her and use he/him pronouns for her up until the very last chapter, even though at one point he says that ""I even start to feel a bit guilty about continuing to think of him as ""he"" at all."". Since Leo begins his transition before the start of the book, Kate always refers to him properly but it is clear that the character has a lot of internalized transphobia that doesn't serve the plot and was most likely a projection of the author's own hidden transphobia. That being said, her immediate reaction to him coming out is to say ""You're a girl?"" to which his reaction explains that ""I actually prefer the term ""natal female"""".

The entire book, whether intentionally or not, implies that trans people want to be their gender rather than already being it. Quite a common theme throughout the book is the idea that Leo isn't who people think he is because he is trans, and the fact that he's trans is used as a plot twist. Here's an extract of his first coming out scene, where he is hesitant to get to fourth base with his girlfriend, Alicia.

>""Alicia squeezes my hand as if to say go on, and I know I can't put it off any longer. Suddenly I feel dizzy, like if I opened my eyes Alicia's room would be spinning at a hundred miles per hour. I take a deep breath.  
>  
>""OK, the reason I've been acting so weird is because I'm not who you think I am.""  
>  
>I feel Alicia's grip on my hand slacken ever so slightly.  
>  
>I need to say it now, quickly, like ripping off a plaster, before I can change my mind.  
>  
>""I wasn't born Leo,"" I say, my voice growing quieter and quieter, so I'm almost whispering.  
>  
>Ella Fitzgerald has stopped singing. The room is silent.  
>  
>""I was born a girl.""  
>  
>I keep my eyes closed as Alicia's hand shoots from mine.""

The idea that trans people aren't who they say they are is incredibly transphobic, and this scene in particular places too much emphasis on *I used to be a girl* when most trans people wouldn't reference themselves like that. I, as a trans girl, would never say that I was *born a boy* as a way of coming out, because it implies that I wasn't always a girl, and if I don't actively come out as trans that doesn't mean that I'm pretending to be someone else. He was pretending to be a girl before he came out, just as Kate was pretending to be a boy. The whole book phrases moments where she is talking about being trans as though she is a boy who wants to be a girl, and not already a girl living in a masculine body.

Kate's private moments before she comes out would have been good if it wasn't painfully obvious that the book was written by a cis person. It contains the (almost) cliché of it being difficult to look in the mirror, which is a real problem for some trans people with major dysphoria but it feels shoehorned in. She does a weekly inspection of herself - things like hair length, foot size, penis size and similar masculinizing features - and writes it all down in a notebook that she... brings to school for some reason???? A lot of trans people will do these kinds of inspections, as it can be like an addiction, but it's not realistic for them to write it down and *bring the book into school.* It's clear that this element was only written in to be a part of her (well written but poorly worded) hate crime where she meets Leo. She also has a dress-up box (this is how it's referenced and presented in the book), which a lot of particularly transfeminine people may have but the way it's written, again, presents her as if she is pretending and wishing to be a girl but isn't actually.

There are many more points that I'm not going to get into right now, but I would love to talk with others who have read this book about it. As a trans girl with some shared experience with Kate, I loved the story but the representation of trans people was awful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y1cuh1/the_hidden_transphobia_in_the_art_of_being_normal/,2022-10-11T16:03:50Z,75,0,books,Normal People,POST
gqoguq,Analyzing Conversations with Friends and Normal People - with major spoilers and minor comparissons for both,"I recently read and posted about Normal People, after watching the great show based on the book. Over the last week I read CwF. I thought Normal People was the better novel. Connell and Marianne's relationship feels very organic, very real. 

Frances in CwF wasn't as interesting as the protagonists in Normal People, but perhaps that was necessary for her relationship with Nick to develop. Frances is the only one who sees Nick as something other than a background character, a less interesting person who just exists in the background of others' lives. I think this is what allows Nick to fall in love with her. Nick has suffered depression and fallen out with his social groups, and it seems even lost the respect of his wife, though he loves her still. Its only after he reveals his cheating that Melissa is willing to fight for him. And fight for him she does. 

I love that letter Melissa sent Frances, so dark, so crushing. When Frances started going to get to togethers at Melissa and Nick's house after their relationship is out in the open, my heart breaks for her because I can't see this ending in any other way than the dissolution of Frances' and Nick's affair. I think the book ended a chapter or two after it should have. After reading her two novels, I think Rooney seems to have a fear of definite endings. I think a better ending would be Frances realizes she loved Bobbi all along.

I guess a theme of this novel could be love is complicated. Bobbi loves Frances, but is afraid of commitment that she'd dissolve their relationship over placing a label on it. Frances' mother loves her dad, even though he is crazy and they've seperated. Nick loves Melissa even though she's treated him like shit and disregards him. Yet on some level, Nick feels he deserves better than this, he starts sleeping alone. Its only after Nick receives Frances' love that he's willing to accept Melissa's love again. Melissa does love Nick though, which is slowly revealed to the reader. Like Frances, we assume she's the one who's fallen out of love with him and their marriage is dead because of it. Its after the affair is revealed that we see Melissa is willing to fight for her husband. And fight for him too - the letter, sending the story to Bobbi, inviting Frances' to dinner have the devastating consequence of bringing Nick and Melissa back together and if Rooney were a stronger author, that would have ended Nick and Frances'.

I don't think the last chapter is poorly written, just not realistic. Rooney is trying too hard to push this idea that love isn't always monogamous, a moral that any educated person has already realized. 

There are a lot of things that one around Rooney's age can relate to in the novel. Pouring over messages with an ex to relive the good times, being a student and having no money, not even for food, even the self harm and anorexia are all things  many can relate to. It was the first of those that got me and almost made me cry.

Rooney writes relationships and intimate moments really well, but I think Normal People was a better novel than CwF. The first half of CwF was a bit slow. I got to the half way point thinking yet another affair novel and almost put it down for a while, probably would have if it hadn't quickly picked up. The circumstances that saw Frances and Nick alone in the first half seemed a little contrived. With Normal People, I was hooked from the beginning. Over the course of Normal People, I saw a lot of growth with Connell and Marianne that I didn't see with Frances or Bobbi in Converstations with Friends. Maybe that is because actions seem to have real consequences. Connell's pettiness to Marianne causes him to lose her, Marianne's unwillingness to affirm her love for Connell causes them to break up a second time and almost ends their relationship a third time. At the end of CwF, Frances and Nick can just keep carrying on. These are hard novels to summarize, there is so much left unsaid within the novels.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gqoguq/analyzing_conversations_with_friends_and_normal/,2020-05-26T02:23:52Z,1,25,books,Normal People,POST

gktvrk,"Normal People by Sally Rooney (the book and the show) - Can someone explain the ending to me? (More show-centric, I hope that's OK) (Spoilers!)","I read the book back in January and thought it was okay, but I also couldn't stop thinking about it. I think it was the miscommunication between Marianne and Connell that bothered me, but also the ending where Marianne stays and promises to be wait for him (or something like that, my memory might be off) while Connell goes to New York.

The series was amazing to watch and remained true to the book, though expanded in a few places, I think to better explain things. The ending was similar to the book, but I don't understand what happened. Were they breaking up? It seemed like they were saying goodbye to each other. Was this the end of their chapter together in each other's lives, just as they finally ended up together for what seemed like good? Or was this their way of saying, ""no matter where we go, we'll always end up back together""? Why couldn't Marianne visit Connell in NY, and why did she reject him saying he'll be back in a year, telling him he doesn't know what will happen?

Not to be dramatic or anything, but my heart hurts for this couple and their story. I loved the portrayals of Marianne and Connell by Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal, respectively. It was just so well done.

fgiihh,I don't visualise characters when reading - and apparently this isn't normal?,"So I just found out that me not visualising characters when reading or their surroundings is unusual (in my poll of 5 people including my SO). I hadn't really thought about it before and was wondering if others do it too?

I take in the information, but instead of physically manifesting what they'd look like, instead for me it creates a feeling of their character. I feel like I know them rather than see them if that makes sense? Like how in the dark you'd instantly just know your SO from what they feel like next to you. 

I do the same with surroundings and places in books. I feel like I know what it's like to be there for the character, but I don't visualise it. 

It's why I don't particularly care when a book is adapted to a film or TV series and people complain the person doesn't look like the character. Instead for me it's the feeling I get when I watch them and how the character's personality/flaws/feelings come out. 

The best instance of this I can think of for me personally is Jane Eyre - the 2011 Mia Wasikowska version vs 2006 Ruth Wilson version. In my opinion although I know Mia physically is much more akin to what's stated in the book, Ruth far outshines her in capturing that restrained passion.

w178cc,"Can normal be captivating? My thoughts on Beautiful World, Where Are you by Sally Rooney"," I honestly did not expect to like this book *so* much!

I usually read fantasy books and what caused me to abandon all of my books on murder and adventure was this book's title - something about it really called to me and I had a sudden urge to find out more about this elusive beautiful world.

This is my first Sally Rooney book and I'm definitely on the side that loves her 'no-quotations' writing style, and her sometimes frustrating characters. What I really loved about Beautiful World, Where Are You is how it perfectly captured the normal, everyday happenings of four friends and their awkward yet very *interesting* conversations.

I can understand why this book is not for everyone. It is slow-paced with nothing much happening, really - just conversations and feelings. All four main characters felt very authentic and realistic to me - they were deeply flawed, often misunderstood everything and everyone, and miscommunicated their true thoughts and emotions. As a reader and a third person observing everything, it was easy for me to point out situations where someone could have said something better and did something better. But this book also pointed out to me that saying the *right* thing and doing the *right* stuff never really happens that often in real life either. Many times conversations with people are very *awkward,* and are very *cringe-y,* and most of them are about people and how you feel.

That's not to say that this book has a ton of meaningless conversations. I really enjoyed every single email exchanged between Eileen and Alice and every single dialogue uttered between Alice, Eileen, Felix, and Simon. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about how they knew each other from a long time ago, how they carry on with their friendship throughout their adult life while also manging their career in different cities.

I loved how Rooney focused mainly on the beauty of relationships and communication which truly is the main essence of this book. It really beautifully showed how friends and partners are so very integral to our state of mind and happiness. What I took away from this book is finding solace in the ordinary - that there's so much ugliness in the world that it's simple and beautiful to love and worry about the people you know. Beautiful World, Where Are You will always be a special book to me and I will cherish these thoughts and memories for as long as I can.

I'm essentially a complete beginner at the age of 30. I have read three books in full so far, The Great Gatsby being the third. I feel a little disappointed and frustrated with it because this is one of the greatest books from America literature of the twentieth century, mandatory reading in some schools. So why have I not taken anything from this book? I feel like there must be something wrong with me for not getting anything out of this book. 

What I'm concerned about is that I have just read a recent thread posted here about this book where there are numerous comments from users who have taken a rich and detailed perspective from the book about various things. Such as the illusion of the American Dream and how the book shows this to be exactly that, a dream, and that no matter how hard we try, we won't smash through the glass ceiling. But that it doesn't matter, because as the characters are laid out in this book, they're all vapid and boring, living dull lives, it's not anywhere any normal person ought to want to break through. 

Take this comment from a user here who has read the book:

> I think that’s what makes this story so relevant to our times. You can “have it all” anytime you want, so we are those “rich people”, because our options for seeking fulfillment are endless. Most pursuits are empty, people with more money just find that out quicker. It’s a good reminder to live happily right now while you can.

That sounds amazing! While my take on it was not so wordy.

I feel there must be something wrong with me, it's mandatory reading for a lot school kids and here I am at the age of 30 and I have taken nothing from it.  

Is there something inherently wrong with the way I'm reading, I know that sounds stupid, but I felt like I had **zero** thoughts on this book once I put it down after reading it. The only thought I did have was, ""excellent! I have now read three books! Onto the next one"". 

Having said all of that, I enjoyed reading it. But perhaps that was just because it was a short book that I could quickly tick off my 20 books to read this year, plus I get to say that I have read three books now!

iv8v6a,Reading at a normal speed,"Hi all. I posted this on the speedreading subreddit but would like some viewpoints outside that community so I have less bias answers/different takes on things.

Hope it's book related enough

Thanks...... 

------

Hi all. 

I'm not looking to be a speed reader. I just want to be around average or even better, a fast reader. I'm not interested in 1000wpm.

Above average would suit me.

Just did an online test and my wpm was 133. My comprehension was 55% which is also poor. The comprehension would have been way lower if some of the answers weren't obvious. 

I'm 35 and I'm a pretty smart guy but my reading sucks balls. I read all the time too and always have.  But my reading  speed hasn't gotten any better. I don't read many books though really, mostly articles on science/politics/facts/history and whatnot.

My comprehension goes up if I'm interested in the subject to the point where I'll probably never forgot what I read. So comprehension is definetly related to interest. But I'd still like to improve comprehension as I think it could help me not have to reread stuff and help me read fiction which I do like but struggle with. A little more speed may keep me more interested too as my current speed is quite tiring and laboursome. 

But anyway I'm learning to program for a career change so I'd like to be able to get through my books a little faster. That's the main reason I am asking for advice here. 

I don't want to read so fast that my comprehension goes down as its quite high right now, (in relation to programing) although I often have to read sentences a few times. 

Ideally I'd like to quarter the amount of times I reread stuff (subjective as I can't really measure this easily) and double or more my wpm so that I'm the high end of average or a little more.

I have ADHD and apparently dyslexia too (even though my spelling is good) I think this comes down to the comprehension I was tested on back in college where I remembered nothing of what I read out loud (although I wasn't warned I'd need to remmeber it 😂) 

There are many articles online that say speed reading doesn't work or you lose comprehension or whatever (of course many argue the opposite) but not much info on how to just become faster and up to a normal speed  without any crazy expectations which has surely got to be possible. 

Should I use the same methods as speed reading to get up to average? Try to sub-vocalise less etc? Does anyone have any advice or specific course suggestions? Is there perhaps stuff I could look into that is more specific to slow readers becoming average and improving comprehension? 

Also people say it can take the joy out of reading but I'm hoping it makes it more joyful for me as I don't need to read things 100 times and it doesn't take a lifetime.

Anyway sorry that was long and rambly but thought it'd be best to be specific in case someone else has been in this situation before. 

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iv8v6a/reading_at_a_normal_speed/,2020-09-18T16:03:33Z,23,13,books,Normal People,POST
cmvgs1,Does speed-reading really exist or can exist for a normal human?,"I consider myself a mediocre learner; my brain is as developed as the next guy's and I don't have the proper thought patterns (or mindset if you will). I'm changing both through practice little by little but there seems to be a limit to how much I can improve. For example, I cannot speed-read. I have had courses on it and even though the idea behind them was promissing, they were faulty and basically didn't work. So if there is a true speed-reading technique that normal people can use to read instructional texts (college books, papers, etc), I have never encountered it. The main problem of these popular methods is that they don't allow a normal human to remember content properly. You remember keywords or phrases only and to an academic or learner who needs details, as many as we can get from a text, they're not enough. Perhaps I'm ultimately asking if a normal person can learn how to read and process written information as a genius. I'm not sure. Regardless, I'd appreciate if you gave any insight on the matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cmvgs1/does_speedreading_really_exist_or_can_exist_for_a/,2019-08-06T20:00:57Z,24,8,books,Normal People,POST
2dusif,Is this feeling normal during reading?,"I generally read literary fiction. That is, I read books that are usually classics and usually big on ideas, world play and generally dense. I enjoy these books while I read them and I find them interesting.

I've been reading *The Unbearable Lightness of Being* by Milan Kundera and while I read it I am able to grasp what is being said and the ideas are clear to me. However, the chapters in this book are only a few pages long and each one changes direction in terms of its topic of discussion. After finishing reading and some 30 odd pages later, I've been finding it difficult to remember what I've read. If it's a plot based book then I'm able to visualize things a lot easier and trace actions chronologically but if it's a book that is digressive (which often is the case in literary fiction), I'm very hard pressed to tell you what was said unless I actually go back to the chapters and read a few sentences and then it sparks a train of thought.

* Dull, sterile protagonists (no personality beyond what serves the story)

For example, When my sister dropped her phone, i said to my head ""and I heard a loud bang, distracted me from what I am doing, I started to get up(then I get up literally after I said this to my head) to see where the sound came, and I saw my sister picking up her cellphone"". That is just one of the many examples, what I found weird is when I talk to other people,   I was starting to describe my feelings or how will I respond just like a protagonist conversing with other characters, I'm sure you know what I mean.

1jtt88,"I just finished the famous 1950 non-fiction book “Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft” by Thor Heyerdahl. If you love accounts of real-life adventure that make you realize how normal, boring and risk averse you really are (Shadow divers, Into Thin Air etc), you’ll love this one!","I had always known the title of this book but not much more than that.  I happened upon it randomly for fifty cents in a used bookstore and decided to pick it up.  For those of you that don’t know, it is the true-life account of 6 Norwegians who in 1947, decided to sail from Peru to Polynesia.  What’s so special about that you ask? Well, they made this brutal trek on the ocean on only a *primitive balsa wood raft*  to prove explorer Thor Heyerdahl’s theory that the Pacific islands could have been settled by ancient South Americans.  4,300 nautical miles.  Months at sea completely isolated from human contact. On an ancient-style, wind-powered log raft.   Sounds crazy right? It was.

Everyone declared them to be embarking on a suicide mission.  (National Geographic refused funding for example.)  “The logs will sink.  You’ll be torn apart by storms.  You will surely die.  There is no way that this can possibly work.”  But you know what? It *did* work.  They famously landed in Polynesia 101 days after their voyage began.  This book is the harrowing, captivating chronicle of the entire expedition from the uncertain beginning to the successful end.  From cutting the logs to battling sharks on the open sea, it is all there.  And pardon my French, but these guys had *balls of steel* to even attempt this.  To think that there are people in this world who will *readily and easily*  put their lives at risk like this simply for the sake of adventure is mind-blowing to me.  I cannot fathom making that kind of decision, yet Heyerdahl seemed to have no problem finding 5 companions to come along for the ride.  

The Kon-Tiki expedition captured the attention of the world and along with other events of the time, it helped to ignite the post WWII interest in Polynesian culture that continues to this day.  The book is immensely readable and Thor’s writing is brisk and it always keeps you interested.  (My edition seems to be from the1950 first edition and it has many photographs taken on the raft.  BONUS: Mine also had lodged within the pages a 1950 washington post newspaper article about the expedition!  From the coloring on the pages where the article is pressed, it seems like I might be the first person since 1950 to have read my particular copy!) 

Strangely enough, I did not know that they just made a movie of this in 2012 until after I started reading the book.  I have not seen it, though it did get good reviews.  Of course, I am going to recommend the book first!  Anyway, I really enjoyed this and I think you guys will too so I thought I’d share.  The trip was really an amazing accomplishment and a fascinating moment  in the history of human exploration.

I've tried reading Dostoyevsky's Notes from the Underground a few months ago, but the first two pages had so many adjectives and words I didn't know even in my own language that I had to keep googling what they meant.

I tend to read a lot, but on my computer, if a topic interests me I'll just read about it after googling it or watch YouTube videos.

I bought Rich Dad Poor Dad a few days ago and I'm reading it now. Really enjoying it as I have an interest in finance, I'm on page 60 or something like that and if you ask me what I've read so far I would probably not be able to tell you except for a few small parts.

Does this happen to anyone else? Just read a book, enjoy it, but not remember anything after stopping? It's like I'm watching a movie. I thoroughly enjoy it, but after it's over I can only remember a few parts, unless it's very memorable.

I thought about writing stuff down to remember later, but this book is not really step by step advice, but more guidelines on how you should think up until now that I've already knew.

Maybe I'm just dumb and can't retain stuff because I've been using a screen for the past 15 years? Hopefully this will pass the more I read.

You're going to do another play-through of an 80's movie in the Final few scenes??) and there were no twists (like how about Halliday wasn't actually dead? Or Og turned out to be the bad guy? A book this flimsy really called for something interesting to happen at the end). I literally felt dirty being pandered to with the constant references (""...and of course, Kevin Smith"") like I was reading the nerd version of 50 Shades of Grey. I'll give Cline two positives: Pretty good premise and fairly effective world-building, especially the chapter where Parzival retreats into his OASIS-only apartment. That all being said, this will likely make for a really fun movie.

Edit: I read it on a Hawaiian vacation, and yes, it was a quick and somewhat fun read. I found myself annoyed, frustrated, or feeling a little used too often to say I enjoyed it, though. My last 6 books have been The Song of Ice and Fire series followed by House of Leaves, so I appreciated the simplicity in that regard!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/48i76x/just_finished_ready_player_one_i_dont_understand/,2016-03-01T19:38:26Z,88,61,books,50 Shades of Grey,POST

wamif,What's with all the hatred towards 50 Shades of Grey?,"Disclaimer: IM NOT SAYING THIS SHIT IS GOOD

But, for a couple of reasons, I don't hate it as much as other people. I see a LOT of hating towards this book. My reasoning is:

a. Danielle Steel and the ""Mommy Porn"" industry has been one of the largest book markets in history, with over a billion dollar profit. I respect Danielle, she's a writer that found out how to exploit for profit a portion of female psyche and went full into that. I respect that. I have never seen a lot of hatred towards DS. What's the difference?

b. I really like the author of FSOG. She doesn't think she's a good writer or that her work is good literature. She feels embarassment every time someone reads an excerpt from her book. She did it as a hobby and as a fetish for herself. It made her millions. But she doesn't say her work is ""Revolutionary"", she even despises her own work on a ""Serious Literature"" level. I like that gal.

c. Are we really surprised with this level of success? Did we really expect more from the Books market? Do we even consider this literature? It hardly seems fair to bash the literary qualities of a book who's author does not even consider srs lit.

I'm comfortable with the existence of FSOG, I like the author as a person, and I have no problems with it. Thoughts? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wamif/whats_with_all_the_hatred_towards_50_shades_of/,2012-07-09T22:30:33Z,29,17,books,50 Shades of Grey,POST

wug5m,50 shades of Grey and Twilight,"Hey everyone. I'm honestly not trying to turn this into a circlejerk. I haven't read 50 Shades of Grey yet, and looking at my book-list, as some of you have previously seen, looks like I may not touch it for a few years. I've read some reviews on it... that was... interesting.

I'm going to be upfront and honest with everyone. I like reading terrible, condescending, horribly written books such as Trance: The Formation of America by Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips, The Vagina Ass of Lucifer Niggarbastard by Shawn Wunjo (which, from what I read of it so far, isn't that poorly written when we look at grammar, syntax, plot, structure... when compared to) Twilight by Stephanie Meyers as much as I like reading well-written books such as The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, The Kite Runnerby Khaled Hosseini, and our my favorite Harry Potter by JK Rowling. I like reading the poorly written books because of the many LOL moments in them inwhich I enjoy sharing with my friends. I had several LOL moments during Twilight.

syp3c,50 shades of grey's runaway success and the fanfic phenomenon,"Okay... so can we talk about *50 Shades of Grey*?

It's not just that they're basically smut (no problem with that) or that they are, as far as I can tell, not terribly well-written (full disclosure, haven't read them; don't think bestsellers need to be brilliant literature). 

But it really does weird me out that *50 Shades of Grey* [started as fanfiction](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/overview.html).

14pria,50 Shades of Grey (my first review & first reddit post!),"Imagine you picked up this book not knowing what you were getting yourself into.
            
I was at work, as a waitress and it was a very, very slow day. So I wanted to download some book to read on my phone until it got busy again. I went to Amazon’s top sellers and I saw all three 50 Shades of Grey books on display. For some reason unknown to me now, I didn’t read the synopsis. I saw that it was supposed to be like Twilight, which may not have been high literary art, but I had found very entertaining.
            
I assumed since 50 Shades of Grey was like Twilight, it was about a werewolf, since Twilight was about vampires. I read enough to know he had a dark secret.
            
Innocently I downloaded the book and began to read. I thought the writing was somewhat annoying, there was a little too much detail about what was going on in Ana’s mind but she seemed like a strong, independent, smart woman. A bit stupid about boys but she seemed to be really holding out for the right one. 

And then she meets Christian Grey, your typical aloof mega-hottie that for some reason seems to be interested in this normal girl. You get that a lot in your average chick lit. There’s a lot of that being sucked into his eyes ridiculousness that you get in Twilight, but I was entertained. I was rooting for them.

So they’re super into each other, but Christian is against it for some reason. Because he’s a werewolf, I thought. Makes sense. He doesn’t want to eat her or something on the full moon.

Christian brings Ana back to his super nice Seattle pad, and since he’s super rich, he needs her to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Of course he doesn’t want her to tell the world he’s a werewolf, right? Makes sense.

And then he brings her to this room, to show her his secret. There are chains and weird things in it, and a really big, ornate bed in the center. OF COURSE, I thought, because he’s a werewolf. He needs to get chained up once a month.

Christian Grey is not a werewolf. And he wants Ana to sign a freaking contract so she can be his sex slave and get chained up whenever he wants. In the contract it specifies how she can dress, what she can eat, how often she has to work out and how often he expects her to come over whenever he wants her to.

And here’s the thing, she was not into that. And she didn’t seem to like being tied up while they had sex. She wanted to be able to touch him and see him. So I assumed the book might be about her changing him, Beauty and the Beast style.

Someone told me she signs the contract.

So I put the book down and never picked it back up.

I think I would have liked it better if it was about a werewolf.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14pria/50_shades_of_grey_my_first_review_first_reddit/,2012-12-12T07:19:50Z,9,0,books,50 Shades of Grey,POST

DAD REVIEWS 50 SHAED OF GREY PART 1: ch 1-16


Anasthesia Steele, she's this girl that does, well I forgot what she's studying but she's in college. So far it's like a love-lust story between insanely this business man and her, and I think that she's attarcted to him because of his money/good looks. But she's kinda cheating herself, thinking that this Mr. Grey is going to get serious. But she's obviously confused because she was presented with a contract on how to be SUBMISSIVE to dominant Mr. Grey. The contract clearly states his intentions as treating her as a sex slave with a sugar-coating of lovely phrases, and she's, she's taking the bitter pill of the contract by falling for the sugar coating of powerful sex. She's not used to this…the book is written is the first person by her! Every sexual encounter is described as being the sexual satifying, to her. At this point I'm not sure what exactly she wants, or is expecting. So I'll keep reading because I don't know what she wants. 

[At this point I interjected to talk about the diction because it's so shitty but then my dad argued for it]

No but she's able to maintain the suspsense, and the fun of the, the shakespearian ""encounters""! There's not a very high standard , she's able to put things together properly, she's maintain-UGH [our dog licked my dad in mouth when he wasn't looking] maintaining the tempo of storytelling. She covered the basics and she added the spice. You have fun and suspsense and lack of confusion, as in the storytelling's going smooth. I only had to look up two words! Anyways I mostly skimmed. I skimmed a lot actually...

all in all I have to say it makes interesting reading.

2c95vu,50 Shades Of WTF: An Honest Review,"The first in a trilogy by new author, E.L James, Fifty Shades of Grey, has been dubbed “Twilight for adults.” This nickname suggests a daring comparison.
It seems hard to imagine how one could mimic the story of stubborn, unadulterated, mortal, teenage girl commits to angst-filled, dreadfully attractive, vampire, teenage boy in a way that could appeal stronger to the adult demographic. Well, get ready female adult population because James’s first novel, Fifty Shades of Grey, is spattered with Stephanie Meyer’s fame-making elements—but ignores the vampire bit, plants the protagonists in their twenties, and thrusts in an erotic fancy for bondage, discipline, submission, and dominance.
So, TwiMoms, are you buying it? Some of you are. In fact, Fifty Shades of Grey, which has sold more than 250,000 copies, has quickly become a book-club favorite among women. Is it the promise of a Twilight-inspired novel written to female adult tastes that is so tempting to readers? What are female adult tastes anyway—James’s novel suggests kinky interests.
Personally, I knew close to nothing regarding the book’s synopsis prior to reading. It was essentially Hollywood’s recent and ongoing hype about the novel that caught my eye. For the past two weeks various blogs have been feeding off the debate about who should play the main characters now that the movie rights to Fifty Shades of Grey have been acquired. In an effort to keep up with the flow of the pop-culture current, I plunged right into the trilogy, skipping any pre-commitment secondary research, beginning with less than I have already given you.
Meet virgin heroine, Anastasia Steele. She is a few final exams away from her college diploma and really needs time to study, but because of her roommate, Kate’s, untimely collision with the flu, she finds herself conducting an interview on the only man she has ever been attracted to, Christian Grey. Anastasia knows nothing about billionaire humanitarian, Mr. Grey, apart from the fact that he is comparable to Adonis in sex appeal, this she just startlingly discovered. But it doesn’t take long for Anastasia to become disgustedly captivated by Mr. Grey’s admitted obsession with control, and it continues to haunt her even after a whole day of trying to put it out of her implausibly innocent mind.
As it turns out, Christian Grey can’t get Anastasia out of his head either, for she is not like anyone whom he has ever met, and he has to have her. For a virgin, Anastasia is pretty easy. A little obvious stalking paired with a prodigal and prophetic gift, is all it took for Christian to get Anastasia right where he wants her: on a tour of his “red room of pain,” contemplating a legal contract that would make her his 24-hour submissive sex slave on the weekends.
Although they have seen little mainstream success, erotic books have been around for a while. However, Fifty Shades of Grey isn’t locked behind closed doors; it is generating a lot of publicity. This is quite puzzling though because despite its emphasized sex appeal, the book is not very stimulating.
Fifty Shades of Grey is disappointing, hardcore, erotica suspense that has the characteristics of a novel that could have been written by a sheltered teenager whose only impression about sex and relationships is based on accidental S&M porno exposure at a young age. The prose is lumpy, it doesn’t branch much, and James overuses italics to emphasize Anastasia’s obvious internal thoughts, which often disconnects the reader from the main action of the scene and does little for the story. There is little story to begin with, actually. In both short and long, Anastasia just wants to hold Christian’s hand, but Christian doesn’t do the girlfriend thing, he just wants to dominate a contracted sexual business partner.
My hopes were held high while reading this book. I was anticipating and longing for that unexpected surprise with every flip of the page, waiting to see what conflict would be introduced, waiting for the revelation that would validate there being two more installments to this otherwise dry and vague, twisted Twilight rip-off—it never came. Instead, the first part ended without any detail compelling enough to convince anyone that Anastasia and Christian’s X-rated, arguably abusive, unconvincing love affair would develop into anything satisfying in the sequel.
Even the kinkiest of readers will be let down by this book, and perhaps even left with feeling like they were seduced into a thankless, lousy love affair. Expect to be both flustered and intrigued, but this book is just a tease—no climax ever comes.

I found almost every aspect lacking, and I personally hated the sex scene, though I hate all sex scenes in books. I also find the romance between Olive and Adam to be lacking. I didn't really feel invested in their romance, and as a result, the story in general. So why do people like it so much? Again, I'm not trying to be a dick or shame anyone who likes this book, I'm actually just curious on why some people like it so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18v4msr/people_who_like_the_love_hypothesis_why/,2023-12-31T09:57:57Z,34,4,books,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
131kvwg,The Love Hypothesis almost had interesting things to say,"So I was raised on traditional masculine escapist fantasies. Action cartoons, anime, 'bling and bitches' rap, the works. Of the female created or female oriented media I've consumed, I would very rarely describe any of it as escapist. While I don't think the book was very good, I did find The Love Hypothesis to be interesting as a first exposure to traditional, dare I say stereotypical, female escapist fantasy.

The Love Hypothesis is about 20-something gradate student Olive, who through a 'comedic' blunder, ends up having to fake-date the 30-something All-Star Stanford professor, Adam Carlsen. The book sees our leads get into whacky hijinks, namely behaving in increasingly inappropriate ways in public, at the provocation of Olive's friend Anh, before they inevitably fall in love.

The book is steeped in the shy girl, brooding guy trope and has all the depth you expect. The spicy but ultimately inconsequential taboo of their romance, her shrinking away from his chiseled phsyique, and their romantic chemistry boiling down to Adam smirking at her every few encounters. The only part of this fantasy that I found interesting was the way it handles conflict resolution.

The climax of the book sees >!Adam have a tenured professor who sexually harassed and bullied Olive blacklisted from academia.!< I know that the big strong man swooping in to save the day isn't exactly very empowering but I kinda get it? 

If you exist at any point of marginalization, I don't think the fantasy is always to put people in their place. For me at least, the dream is to point at the problem and have someone else make it go away. Having to constantly fight and advocate for yourself is exhausting, so this is the one point of escapism that spoke to me. 

It's a shame that the book doesn't focus more on these more pernicious aspects of academia. Our two supporting cast members are a queer man and a woman of color. I would've found digging into the struggles they faced and the struggles of academia far more interesting to read about that the contrived romance between Olive and Adam.

Unless you're absolutely fiending for some unlicensed Rey/Kylo Ren fan fiction, I think this one is a safe skip.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/131kvwg/the_love_hypothesis_almost_had_interesting_things/,2023-04-28T07:39:09Z,31,28,books,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
10qcxc4,The Love Hypothesis: Empty Pretentions,"Ali Hazelwood is a trending author writing under a pen name in the contemporary romance genre. The author's specific niche is in ""academic romance,"" portraying social circles within academia and professional fields stemming from the author's claimed background as a neuroscience PhD and professor. 


""The Love Hypothesis"" was recommended to my significant other by a labmate, and we (she, a cogsci postdoc; I, a tissue engineering researcher) have shared the experience reading aloud to each other. 


As she said, ***""It would be forgivable if it were well-written fiction that didn't portray academia accurately, or if it were accurate to academia but awkwardly written.""***

As a piece of contemporary romance, it is Kylo Ren/Rey fan-fic with superficial characterization. The entire vocabulary of the female lead Olive consists of ""Yep."" and repeating herself in affirmation, while the male lead knows only to repeat her dialogue questioningly. Every point of romantic progression relies on contrivance, such as jeering from friends to kiss or the ""need"" to lap-sit in a crowded lecture hall. 


As academic fiction, the only elements of academia present are the power hierarchy between the love interests and occasional technobabble to inform the audience which characters are ""smart."" Research, teaching, or any other aspect of academic life is absent except in throwaway vague lines about what occupies a character's day. Even these few allusions are oddly out-of-touch, such as frequent violation of biohazard hygiene and the male lead apparently shattering contaminated glassware across the room in front of students as a display of frustration. For all the main character's impostor syndrome or reported brilliance by other characters, her research project is of no relevance and poorly defined. 


In a premise rife with ethical violations (faculty-graduate student relationship in same department, PDA in professional settings), the improbability of the romance could have possibly been justified by the appeal of the taboo. Instead, the story makes a near-revolting premise feel more boring than a middle school romance. Neither character has the emotional intelligence nor willpower to engage, so the two lame-ducks bob along in a series of unbelievably contrived scenarios forcing them into intimate space as they comment awkwardly. Despite being 25 and 32, neither character seems to have any prior relationship experience or romantic agency: they stumble oblivious to basic social custom like aliens reenacting an AI-generated script. 


Even if it were simply Reylo fanfic on Wattpad without the tacked-on ""scientist"" fantasy, it would read poorly in comparison to its competition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10qcxc4/the_love_hypothesis_empty_pretentions/,2023-01-31T22:43:44Z,18,33,books,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

usjbza,The Love Hypothesis: a personal review,"Having first come across this book on TikTok, I was intrigued. I have read multiple reviews that have described the romance and characters as unconventional and explored from a new angle. As an avid reader, I was excited to read a novel that explores romance from a new perspective, however was left deeply disappointed. Having been promised an exciting plot and well developed characters, I feel like I have been metaphorically robbed. This book reads like a 2015 Wattpad fanfic, with an overdone storyline and basic protagonist and love interest. Hazelwood begins to explore some relevant ideas of today’s society, especially with the character of Anh Pham, Olive Smith’s best friend, however her only personality trait is being a woman of colour in STEM. Although inclusivity is indubitably an important conversation, Anh makes academia her entire personality, making her appear tacky and superficial. Olive and Adam’s entire relationship is perfunctory, and in no way original or interesting. The way the novel is written almost contradicts Hazelwood’s attempt to address feminism; having made Olive nothing more than a mess, always in need of rescue. There was tremendous potential to make her a legitimate role model with an actual personality, instead the character fell flat. Adam, on the other hand, is always serious and put together, with seemingly a perfect life, except for a miraculously absent relationship. Hazelwood describes him as a ‘moody asshole’, perpetuating the popular hate-everyone-but-her trope, which, aside from being one of the most overused tropes when it comes to male characters, is incredibly toxic. In addition, the characters’ physical appearance is another trite flaw in the book, making Adam tall, broad, with chiselled features, mysterious eyes and a rare smile, seemingly reserved only for Olive; always perfectly dressed in clothes that are ‘custom made’ to accentuate his physique. Olive, on the contrary, is a typical muddle of a person, with a ‘messy bun’ and stretched out T-shirts, uncaring about her outward appearance. The unlikely relationship between an overly masculine, strong man, and a feeble, perturbed girl, who is completely incapable of doing anything herself, is a cliché, threadbare concept that has been done over and over in literature, making this piece unoriginal and banal. The chapters in which the protagonists have sex are written relatively accurately, however once again sustain the idea of a physically large male and a small, feeble female, who is, even after preparation, still too ‘small and tight’, making the scene take on an uncomfortable atmosphere. Of course Olive is inexperienced and needs to be taught and guided by Adam, who is naturally a wonder in bed. The language that is used throughout the book appeals to an older teenage audience, with the use of swearing in an attempt to make the novel more relatable. Overall, although easy to read, I did not get any enjoyment out of the experience, and would not read the book again. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/usjbza/the_love_hypothesis_a_personal_review/,2022-05-18T18:24:04Z,34,44,books,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

vr9oot,finshed reading the love hypothesis as someone who wears contacts,"So i finished reading the love hypothesis a few days ago. And I really liked the book but I hated how they portrayed the fact that she wore contacts. so I do not think it's a spoiler but either way ill try to give just enough info so that if you didn't read the book you would still understand and not be spoiled.

so we find out in the first chapter she is a grad student and wears contacts well I also wear contacts. and any contact wearer I know has also glasses for in the evening at home or whatever. and because she is a grad student she doesn't have a lot of money

well, apertanly she doesn't because she wore 3-YEAR-OLD CONTACTS you can max wear them for 4 to maybe 5 weeks. so that's incredibly long. for sure because after a few weeks your contacts weaken so they don't provide that much help.

so i don't understand why she couldn't just wear glasses it would make more sense since you can wear them for 3 years and still give the support.  but besides that, I really enjoyed the book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vr9oot/finshed_reading_the_love_hypothesis_as_someone/,2022-07-04T15:16:26Z,13,20,books,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
svy9tf,Contemporary romance is cozy and a fun read: The Love Hypothesis,"I just finished reading The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood, and I’m shocked how much I really loved it. Romance is not really my genre of choice, but I’ve recently been adding some of it to my rotation of books, generally contemporary romance/rom com. 

I find this genre in general, and this book specifically, to be very cozy and cute. Some aspects (the central relationship) are completely predictable, and there is something comforting about that. You can feel angst and discomfort for the characters and still know it’s gonna work out. The banter is always fun, and the generally unrealistic/hyperbolic scenarios are a laugh, if you’re willing to go along for the ride. 

Now, for this book specifically… I loved the male protagonists, even though I occasionally found his protective, caring behavior over the top. I loved the academic setting. As a former female phd student in engineering, I enjoyed the throwback, though, of course, the scene is not entirely realistic. For some reason what bothered me the most here, was her saying that STEM phd programs are all white men. I wasn’t in biology, but while mostly men, STEM phd programs have a ton on ethnic and geographic diversity, with loads of international students. But that’s obviously not super-important. 

>! Now, let’s address the sexual harassment storyline. While Tom is over the top crappy and predatory, the whole thing rang pretty true to me, with the discussion of the power dynamic and just the existence of sucky predatory men in super successful grad labs. I really appreciated this storyline, though I kind of wish she didn’t have the video to wrap things up so neatly, but that would be darker and more realistic. Just an FYI: this shit happens. And most of the time the professors don’t get fired. !< 

Anyways, really enjoyed this read, and the build up was fantastic. Adam is a fantastically dreamy protagonist, Olive is cool, and >! Malcolm and Holden are so fucking cute!<.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/svy9tf/contemporary_romance_is_cozy_and_a_fun_read_the/,2022-02-19T01:42:17Z,12,35,books,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

zlbzdc,"Do you read newly released books, or do you stick to the classics?","My fiancée loves contemporary poplit authors like Coleen Hoover and books like The Love Hypothesis and Where the Crawdads Sing. 

Most poplit doesn’t appeal to me—I reached this conclusion after reading the drivel that was Ready Player One (just my opinion, I don’t mind if you like it). I think, ultimately, that I believe every great story has already been written. So why try to find something new?

After reading RP1, I decided to try and go back in time, and this began a newfound journey to read the time-tested examples of storytelling through the western canon (I’d like to get into more Japanese authors as well, but I’m keeping it to LATAM/American/English authors for now). 

I know there’s no accounting for taste, and I’m just glad my fiancée reads books at all. But I’ve found it hard to truly love any contemporary books. I suppose that’s the rub, though: today’s books haven’t been around long enough to be inserted into the canon. 

By “today’s books” I guess I mean everything post/internet, as I believe the internet has changed humanity’s relationship with the written word. It’s great as a search tool, but maybe the overall quality of writing among the blockbuster books of the day are in decline compared to yesterday. 

I also think contemporary fiction tends to emphasize plot over characters or themes. Personally, those things are my jam, and that’s why I’m looking forward to reading Cormac McCarthy’s latest books (ironically enough). Any recommendations your have for contemporary books in this vein, I’ll take them!

I’m rambling now, but I’ll pose the question—do you tend to gravitate toward “canonized” literature, or do you like to keep up with what’s popular now? Or do you not fret about that stuff in general?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zlbzdc/do_you_read_newly_released_books_or_do_you_stick/,2022-12-14T00:24:22Z,167,1,books,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
16wuj61,The Big Book of Science Fiction Read - Week 4 - The New Overworld by Paul Scheerbart,"There is apparently a hypothesis that we are unable to commune with intelligent life outside our planet because it is always doomed to destroy itself. This may be a simplistic explanation for a complex reality but it is one with which I don’t entirely disagree; as the basic hypothesis is a sound one - conscious life forms are incredibly destructive.  The author of this week’s story from The Big Book of Science Fiction - Paul Scheerbart has a more idealistic take on the subject.   
Scheerbart’s story, the fourth in this collection is short, and reads more like a vignette. It ends as it begins -  in medias res, while the content itself straddles the thin line dividing fictional reportage and storytelling. It isn’t a particularly entertaining read but it was interesting from the viewpoint of early science fiction and science fiction that doesn’t belong in the American Canon.   
In Scheerbart’s fictional Venus, two races cohabit peacefully on its solar surface. One race is indolent while the other is dynamic. Scheerbart’s descriptions of these races lack any evolutionary context and border more on absurdism or surrealism. Whatever conflict exists between these two races, is usually resolved through conversation to the benefit of both races and without any bloodshed - culminating in a new way of being for one race while the rather indolent race is left to follow its usual form of life.   
Scheerbart’s story is a Utopian ideal - it gives very human characteristics (of thought, not physiognomy) to an alien race, removing any sense of individuality and conflict from the equation, to force a peaceful solution. The same can be said of Sultana’s Dream, the second story in the series which attempts to do the same. The very idea of a Contes Philosophique is rather flawed in a sense - it negates individualism and dissent, imagining a rather bland homogenous society in which all is agreeable and the course of history is never surprising - but rather pedestrain and pre ordained. As a result, the vehicle of storytelling which carries these ideas must of necessity be as bland by association, robbing storytelling of its dynamic nature and individualism.   
The Vandermeer’s, in their opening essay, champion this form of storytelling - stating quite plainly that stories need to move away from character growth and development and into the realm of ideas. I strongly disagree - when the first men sat across from each other, the embers of a fire cooling between them stories are what they wove to make sense of the world around them. These stories have morphed into various storytelling devices over the years but the essential core is the same -  they are meant to excite and delight and move - arousing empathy within us, and awakening our shared sense of humanity. These philosophical exercises on the other hand worship ideas over humanity - with not nearly the same effect.   
On balance, Scheerbart himself is a rather more interesting personality than his short story - a man known for his strong association with architecture and the fantastic, most of his works have not been translated into English as was the case for several German authors, as a reaction to the First and Second World Wars. It is always lovely to see a writer pulled out of the seas of obscurity but I think Scheerbart’s vibrant personality could have been better served by a more considered selection from his bibliography than this present story.

10adycf,"A review of what somehow miraculously became Goodreads' Book of the Year: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, by Gabrielle Zevin","Sam begrudgingly set aside his Nintendo controller, on which he was playing the seminal video game *Legend of Zelda*, a game that this author may choose to nerd out about and describe to the reader for no reason whatsoever, as the gamers amongst the readerbase know exactly what *Legend of Zelda* is and don't need the exposition, while the non-gamers REALLY will not care, and spoke to Sadie, who had just arrived late.

Sadie had been delayed because, on her way to Sam, her mother Anna was busy telling her the story about how a woman jumped to her death in front of her, and a grisly display of human viscera erupted in front of her. Unfazed, Anna struck up a conversation.

""Hi, nearly dead person who is shockingly still alive and whose current state of being is likely to traumatize me for life, I'm Anna! Did you lose your step?""

""Yes. Would you like to exchange banal dialogue during my final moments of my life? I should be in shock or screaming or something, but this seems like the perfect time to carry on a rather vapid conversation.""

""Great! Well I hope you don't mind if I spend this time talking about myself and my career."" Anna proceeds to tell the woman who is moments away from oblivion about her acting career, and the woman politely (?) chooses to listen.

""Oh by the way, have you ever heard of this really unusual, avant-garde instrumental artist named MILES DAVIS? Are you familiar with this really crazy genre of music called 'Jazz music'?""

""Why no, I will check that out in the afterlife!""

""Yes, you should!"" The woman then proceeds to die.

Anyway, Sadie and Sam begin a conversation.

""Hi Sam. I love you. Did you know that I love you?""

""No you don't! You hate me!""

""Well screw you! Maybe I do hate you! Except I love you. Man, there's got to be some middle ground here? Maybe?""

""No! Wait actually I think I love you too. I love you Sadie! In some really, uh, nonsensical way that is beyond my capabilities of actually describing in this book. But let's continue to have a clearly toxic relationship with one another and let our unhealthy habits continue for years on end, only for them to end because randomly one of us just has an epiphany out of the blue that we love the other person, though not romantically, because the author REALLY wants to drive home some point about how love is about more than sex, even if she interjects a lot of completely random, arbitrary, useless sex stuff into her story.""

""I love you too, Sam! Yay!""

If you want 400 pages of this nonsense, by all means, please, read this book.

I've spent the last few days trying to figure out how this happened, how I came to so strongly dislike a book that Goodreads voted as the best book of 2022. I would have expected that such a book be, at the very least, an OKAY book. And it is nowhere close. In fact, I'm not kidding when I say I might consider it one of the worst books I've ever read, if not one of the most insulting. How does this happen? How does a book that is this terrible, this poorly written, become so popular?

The reason, I have come to conclude, is that, for whatever reason, gamers are somehow hypnotized by a book that talks about the thing they love and makes it the focus of that book. Because, I'll admit, there are very few books that take gaming seriously, ESPECIALLY working in the gaming industry. Gamers had to deal with a lot of ostracization throughout their life, people telling them to *go outside and play* rather than trying to reach the final level of Super Mario 3 for the 47th time. And as a fellow gamer, I sympathize. That being said, I certainly never made gaming my identity and didn't make it the only thing I cared about in life.

But throughout my years of gaming, and what ultimately led me to quitting MMORPGs forever in particular, is that a lot of gamers somehow really get stuck in the world of gaming. As in they really have no interests in stuff outside of games and perhaps fantasy literature too, but you mention some Oscar contender movies like Banshees of Inisherin or The Whale or the magnificent performance by Cate Blanchett in Tar, or the amazing music put out this year by Big Thief, Alvvays, Black Country New Road, Black Midi, even Beyonce's Renaissance, or the hilarious cuteness of Abbott Elementary or the scathing and witty dialogue of Succession or the mysterious thrills of Severance, and they've probably literally not even heard about any of it. This is some of the best content that pop culture has to offer in the modern world, and the gaming community just, for whatever reason, misses it all and doesn't care about it in the slightest, because, like I said, I suspect they are VERY HEAVILY sucked into gaming culture.

And I think that's exactly what propelled the overly inflated positive reception of this book. The gamers of the world found a book about gamers and ate it up. I think gamers are smart enough to up their standards and learn a thing or two about what makes a book great, or at the very least, what makes a book MAKE SENSE (because a lot of stuff that happened in this book is complete nonsense), but that won't really start until people make an effort to start caring about things other than video games. I know video games are great, but you HAVE to start caring about other stuff! For real, this book finally helped me understand exactly what the obsession with video games and gaming culture has done to people: it made people believe that a book with nonsensical story, with zero-dimensional characters whose actions make no sense, whose themes are a total mish-mash where nothing actually lands and is only there because the author is literally saying stuff like ""sometimes people suffer on an individual level because of systems outside of their control, which is an example of systemic racism!"", is actually a good book, *SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE'S STUFF ABOUT VIDEO GAMES IN IT.* And if that doesn't epitomize how all-encompassing gamer culture has become, I don't know what else could.

For real, if you are a non-gamer, you can skip this book, though to be honest, I would really love to hear the opinions of non-gamers who read this book. I suspect that if they liked it at all, it won't be anywhere near the praise that the gamer crowd is heaping on this book.

o85foo,The Alchemist is GOOD,"**TLDR; Just finished the book and absolutely love it.**

Yeah I said it. This book has some of the most amazing lessons one can take in their life. From this point, I know that no matter WHAT HAPPENS, I’m okay, because I fought to the end with my personal legend. All my life I have struggled with anxiety and depression, fighting everyday to understand how to be happy in this world. 

I worked hard with meditation and other practices for the past 3 years, and this book spoke volumes to me what I have been doing, and to KEEP MOVING FORWARD. No matter what life throws at me, I will keep understanding psychology, spirituality, and science to see things for what they are.

I notice a lot of disdain for this book, which I understand. However, I have a hypothesis for why. The words on the surface can be perceived as trite. However, I have found in my experience with the work I do that the simplest of advice is the highest and most effective form! The ego LOVES clouding the mind with concepts and ideas without actually tuning into the present moment, something SO FUCKING SIMPLE. That’s literally what the book is talking about when the Alchemist makes the point about others not believing in the treasures you have. It triggers fear and thus rejection. The mind doesn’t like simple.

I’m not saying you have to like the book, but I would consider thinking twice about the value it can bring to ones life. As I finished the last chapter I had tears rolling down my face because of how beautiful it is. KEEP MOVING FORWARD!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o85foo/the_alchemist_is_good/,2021-06-26T06:31:58Z,15,23,books,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
iy0h9v,The Forge of God and Anvil of Stars may be the perfect sci fi,"I just finished Anvil of Stars and I just have to say: wow. I loved both The Forge of God and Anvil of Stars. I also liked that while the story's scope and story was epic, he wrote two darn good books and wrapped it up. Too often I feel like sci fi authors try to stretch a good idea into too many books (looking at you Frank Herbert,) but that's not an issue here. We get an insane twisty first book, a sequel that resolves all the conflicts in book one, and its done. I highly recommend it to anyone that hasn't read it before. I'd recommend not reading synopses prior! It's first contact gone wrong with plenty of twists!

j4ta2i,I have lost the ability to read for pleasure,"I have seen many posts on Reddit with a basic theme similar to mine: once voracious readers become busy or stressed or depressed or ... and end up unable - or unwilling - to read for fun, even when they feel they would enjoy reading again. In my case I would be almost willing to chalk it up depression or stress but I feel that wouldn’t be a true portrayal of my situation. I have a different hypothesis.

I think I can’t read for fun anymore because I see reading as a job. 

This may seem odd for some of you so perhaps let me explain why I think this. When I was younger, reading was an exercise in imagination. Fantasy was my favorite genre and I loved to imagine myself as a hero in something like the Prydain chronicles or Belgariad. As I got a bit older, I moved to reading books more aligned with my interests. I remember reading a Stonewall Jackson biography after learning about him in a history lesson, for example. At all times, though, I was being transported by the author into a setting of their choosing, guided by their tone. If I had to pin down one thing that was the most fun for me as a reader, it would be this whisking away.

Now though, I struggle to even finish a chapter where once I would finish books in a single sitting. I hate to blame it on something so silly, but I truly think there’s a culprit behind this. Not loss of innocence and gain of experience, but perhaps gain of perspective. I believe that earning an English degree throttled my love of reading.

As a rule, an English degree is going to require a ton of reading - this is quite obvious - and analyzing and comparing and discussing. Whereas once I was able to (or perhaps I had no choice) let the author transport me somewhere else, I now feel like I can look at the words on the page and see their very DNA. The building blocks of story and plot, the themes knowingly shared between novels, the seeming obsession of southern literature and ugly hats: this and more became my reading experience. In order to read I had to analyze the author’s every intent.

While this may be rewarding and interesting as a pursuit, as a method of reading for fun or leisure it fails quite horribly. Now whenever I read I can’t extricate myself from this mindset. I recently tried to read “A Confederacy of Dunces” and failed miserably even though I knew that it was a book right up my alley after the first few pages. I was too focused on identifying themes, analyzing diction, and mapping out the characterization in my head that I couldn’t simply relax a bit.

Maybe I’m coming at this from the wrong direction. I still like movies even when they have more literary style plots and tone. I watched parasite and enjoyed it and I recently watched Brief Encounter and found it superb even though it was a style I generally dislike. Does anyone here have a similar experience they went through or advice for this sort of issue? Maybe some book recommendations that would be relevant? 

Rant over I suppose- at the least I hope it all was tolerable and I thank you for reading this far. I probably wouldn’t have made it to this point!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/j4ta2i/i_have_lost_the_ability_to_read_for_pleasure/,2020-10-04T04:47:07Z,19,8,books,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

Maybe it’s time to start believing in some things, after all.|/u/OhCatmyCat
2nd Runner-Up|*The Love Hypothesis*|Ali Hazelwood|As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships--but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees. That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding... six-pack abs.|/u/alexatennant

Winner|*The Last House on Needless Street*|Catriona Ward|This is the story of a serial killer. A stolen child. Revenge. Death. And an ordinary house at the end of an ordinary street. All these things are true. And yet they are all lies... You think you know what's inside the last house on Needless Street. You think you've read this story before. That's where you're wrong. In the dark forest at the end of Needless Street, lies something buried. But it's not what you think...|/u/coys6767
1st Runner-Up|*The Final Girl Support Group*|Grady Hendrix|Lynnette Tarkington is a real-life final girl who survived a massacre twenty-two years ago, and it has defined every day of her life since. And she's not alone. For more than a decade she's been meeting with five other actual final girls and their therapist in a support group for those who survived the unthinkable, putting their lives back together, piece by piece. That is until one of the women misses a meeting and Lynnette's worst fears are realized--someone knows about the group and is determined to take their lives apart again, piece by piece. But the thing about these final girls is that they have each other now, and no matter how bad the odds, how dark the night, how sharp the knife, they will never, ever give up.|/u/phate00
2nd Runner-Up|*My Heart is a Chainsaw*|Stephen Graham Jones|Jade Daniels is an angry, half-Indian outcast with an abusive father, an absent mother, and an entire town that wants nothing to do with her. She lives in her own world, a world in which protection comes from an unusual source: horror movies…especially the ones where a masked killer seeks revenge on a world that wronged them. And Jade narrates the quirky history of Proofrock as if it is one of those movies. But when blood actually starts to spill into the waters of Indian Lake, she pulls us into her dizzying, encyclopedic mind of blood and masked murderers, and predicts exactly how the plot will unfold.|/u/SOSpineapple

They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing OxyContin, a blockbuster painkiller that was a catalyst for the opioid crisis.|/u/ImFrank693

2u1ghh,Catcher in the Rye (possible pedophilia) theory,"So I have been reading The catcher in the Rye for school, and I came across a section involving Mr.Antolini petting Holden's head. This surprised me, and I went back and noticed that Holden became extremely sleepy after eating the cake and drinking the coffee. So I thought, I don't have enough reason to make a hypothesis about this, so I thought about it for a minute and realized, what if James Castle killed himself because of Antolini. Holden explains what he thought caused James to kill himself, however this is only from his POV. I am of course implying that Antolini sexually harassed James Castle, and possibly other boys who were stressed heavily.

16da65b,"Who's your worst human book villain? ""The Love Hypothesis"" by Ali Hazelwood","Of the few books I've read so far Tom Belton from ""The Love Hypothesis"" by Ali Hazelwood has to be my number one human villain. I'm sure other characters from books I've read have done worse but they aren't human. The way he treated Adam and Olive was twisted. He was a fake friend to Adam for years and threatened his girlfriend behind his back. He harassed Olive and threatened to steal her research. He spewed foul toxic garbage at her and felt entitled to her body and work. The worst part is how good he was at hiding his true personality until the end of the book. I honestly didn't see the switch in his personality and his true intentions coming at all.

    And she obliges. Just because her friends asks her to do it, she does it. I lost respect for this book after that one incident and then there was another.

qk0u1z,I can’t stop thinking about The Love Hypothesis,"This book was sooooooo cute.

I especially loved how fast it moved. The pacing of the story was perfect. I just read Adam’s chapter and it left me swooning all over again. 

A lot of people talk about the sex scene and how hot it was (I agree, it was amazing and well worth it). I especially loved when Olive tells Adam that she loves how he smells, oh those pheromones ….. 

But my favourite part was definitely, “I’m going to kill you. If you say another word about the woman I love, if you look at her, if you even think about her - I’m going to fucking kill you.”

Like I was losing my mind you guys. I wish there was a fight. Like Adam should have at least swung on him. His friend was disgusting.  

If anyone has any similar recommendations I would really appreciate it. I do like the brooding, steamy guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/qk0u1z/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_the_love_hypothesis/,2021-10-31T22:58:01Z,92,304,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

qpqa6u,I’m in love with ‘The Love Hypothesis’!,"Thanks to this amazing sub, I found this incredible book! I was in a reading slump for the last couple of days and this book was the perfect pick me up! 

This book started off as a Reylo fanfic and I think it does the grumpy-sunshine trope so well! There is also the fake dating trope, and the teacher-student trope (sort of). This book has great character development, good pacing, amazing slow burn chemistry, and science (Yes!! there is plenty of science talk!!) It gave me all sorts of warm and tingly feelings. 

Go read ‘The Love Hypothesis’ by Ali Hazelwood if you haven’t done so already! It is fantastic!

I liked the Hating Game, though it was ok, but didn’t quite hit the spot (e.g. where’s my epilogue??!). However, I loved the Love Hypothesis. It has it’s flaws, sure, but I was super wrapped up in the story and I really enjoyed it. 
My theory is this: you either love the Hating Game and dislike or feel meh about the Love Hypothesis or you love the Love Hypothesis and dislike or feel meh about the Hating Game.

16l155e,Gushing about the Love Hypothesis,"So I am finally reading {Love, Theoretically by Ali Hazelwood} and I got to the part when they talk about how Jack and Adam met. For people who don’t know, Jack was an undergrad and Adam was in grad and Jack ran a really bad Southern Blot in lab. This, just the bad Southern Blot, made me laugh out loud. Kicking my feet and everything, which reminded me so much of why I loved {The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood} 

Sure, the romance is fine. Nothing incredibly special. It was throughly enjoyable, but what I loved was Olive’s science!

I am currently on a clinical rotation to be certified as a molecular biologist, so basically what Olive does but for patients and no research (and no PhD). But I would read this book and see the things that I would be doing and then did, the things I would learn about in my classes, like PCR. 

My major and future profession is not very well known, so to see something very related, something that I would what to pursue if I was to get a PhD, just makes me so happy. 

So yes I laugh out loud at the Southern Blot comment because they are long, tedious, and out-dated!

qr3rph,Am I the only one who DNF The Love Hypothesis?,"This is my first Reddit post so if I am doing anything wrong, please let me know. 

I have been in a bit of a reading slump and have been waiting for my hold of The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood to be up at my library in hopes that it would be the book to break my slump. Everyone says so much great stuff about this book and I was really excited but know not to get my hopes up. The thing is, I can’t bring myself to finish the book. I can’t stand the way the FMC ignores all logic, which is funny since she is a scientist. 

Example, not sure if this counts as a spoiler:
>!Character: he has been in love with you for years
FMC: Obviously he must be talking about someone else because even though he specifically referred to me directly, he must be talking about anyone but me!<

The idea that the FMC can be told something to her face and dismiss it as not true even though she wishes it were. This trope is exactly what put me in my slump in the first place. I read Neanderthal Seeks Human by Penny Reid recently and had the same issue. There is a difference between being naive and being obtuse. Honestly, it is not a bad book but it certainly isn’t helping my book slump. 

The MMC is interesting but writing just makes everyone else seem lifeless to me. It is the same formula that drives me away from books. Normally I wouldn’t bother posting in the internet about this kind of thing but I went to see the new Marvel movie The Eternals and loved it even though every other movie reviewer is calling it the worst Marvel movie yet and I just need to make sure that I am not crazy. I’m not trying to yuck anyone’s yum! I can see how this would be a popular book but I haven’t heard anything other than “This is the best contemporary romance in years.” Am I crazy? Can I ask someone who loves this book what I am missing because I really want to like it and might try it again once this slump is over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/qr3rph/am_i_the_only_one_who_dnf_the_love_hypothesis/,2021-11-10T20:46:43Z,76,103,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

qz93u7,The Love Hypothesis made me want to scream at my audiobook narrator,"The absolute lengths the author goes to bend this character into an obtuse naive beautiful girl who doesn't know she's beautiful and thinks no one could ever love her or want her is ridiculous. Does anyone else get annoyed by this trope. Most women know men want them, even just for a night, but they worry men won't want more, or think they're worthy of marrying etc. The idea that this beautiful girl surrounded by men isn't aware she's gorgeous? C'mon! I went to an engineering school and the women in STEM are hit on relentlessly and have to establish firm boundaries. I just cringed through an entire book that everyone apparently loved.

EDIT: I forgot the other thing...her best friend Ann was so obnoxious and kept pushing her to kiss him for pushing a truck, slather sunscreen on him, sit on his lap. It was so heavy handed that I actually thought she knew it was all a lie and wanted to force Olive to break by coercing her so much. Also Holden literally says he's been pining over you for years and she's like ""this brilliant scientist clearly has no idea who his lifelong best friend is in love with and must be thinking of literally anyone else but me"" because she has no self-esteem. Maybe I just hate the ""she doesn't know she's beautiful"" trope. I will say it was a quick, easy read and the storytelling was compelling enough that I put the audiobook on wherever I went.

Specifically how she got in her own way by jumping to conclusions backed up by her insecurity. I don't think she is an annoying character and being insecure is normal but Olive gets extra with it. 

After Holden tells Olive that Adam has been in love with her and looking for her for years. Olive at this point knows that Adam is the guy from the bathroom two years prior instead of accepting that Adam loves her. She jumps to the very random conclusion that Adam must be in love with another woman at their school and Olive ruined that for him.

vmeqrk,I just finished The Love Hypothesis and…,"…I am deceased!!

I LOVED Adam! He’s the best bf / character in a romance I’ve read in a long long time.

ul2yc6,Just finished The Love Hypothesis,"Spoilers ahead! 

I read it in a day. I could NOT PUT IT DOWN! I don’t know what it was about this sweet romance novel?! It was just simply wonderful. 

Maybe it was because at times it made me literally laugh out loud?

Maybe it was because Olive was a really likable FMC? 

Maybe it was because Adam was absolute perfection and the chocolate protein bar is what really did it for me?

1434sa8,The worst part about the Love Hypothesis,"I just finished The Love Hypothesis last night and I …. didn’t love it. I won’t go into extreme detail because I read through this sub and my thoughts are pretty well summarized in so many of the discussions of this book. 

BUT IMO the worst part of this book that I didn’t see anyone talking about was Holden and Malcom’s completely forced, ridiculously timed relationship. By this point in the book my suspension of disbelief was hanging on by a thread as it is, but for in the very last second MMC’s and FMC’s best friends to hook and then immediately be “dating” was just too much. Not to mention how completely cringey and middle school all of their interactions were.

ADAM - I love the banter they have. This opening scene alone is my absolute favorite. AND I heard he's obsessive so...

“Are you okay?” He must be really tall. His voice sounded like it came from ten feet above her. “Sure. Why do you ask?” “Because you are crying. In my bathroom.” “Oh, I’m not crying. Well, I sort of am, but it’s just tears, you know?” “I do not.”

[...]

“It’s my contacts. They expired some time ago, and they were never that great to begin with. They messed up my eyes. I’ve taken them off, but . . .” She shrugged. Hopefully in his direction. “It takes a while, before they get better.” “You put in expired contacts?” He sounded personally offended. “Just a little expired.” “What’s ‘a little’?” “I don’t know. A few years?” “What?” His consonants were sharp and precise. Crisp. Pleasant. “Only just a couple, I think.” “Just a couple of years?” “It’s okay. Expiration dates are for the weak.”A sharp sound—some kind of snort. “Expiration dates are so I don’t find you weeping in the corner of my bathroom.”

Then with Adam. Anh oversteps and tells Olive to do things to him. Like kissing him and putting sunscreen on him. When Olive says no she compares it to putting sunscreen on her boyfriend's face (Jeremy) to putting it on shirtless sweaty Adam.

q2x105,I read The Love Hypothesis last week and need to gush,"So. I read The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood and I loved it. 

The story line is rather predictable but it's not horrible nor a deal breaker for me because Ali Hazelwood's writing made it a non issue for me. I thought the characters were super cute and was rooting for them the whole time, of course!

There's one sex scene, but it's two chapters long and it is SO. GOOD. Like, best and most real I've read in a long time. I *loved* it. It inspired me to also go ask my husband for some love, and if a romance does that, then it means it's pretty damn good in my book. 

I spent undergrad doing scientific research in a lab much like Olive did, except she was doing her PhD. Let me just say, if you've ever worked in a lab like that, you will loooove this book. My husband also has worked in a lab and there were some sentences that I read him where we were both like ""the author has to have been in academia"" because it was too true. We said this before I read the about the author section and found out she actually was/is in academia.

q92th4,Just finished The Love Hypothesis!!,"*WARNING: there are (slight) spoilers written here. The book is pretty predictable (not in a bad way though) so I’m not sure if these are really considered spoilers, but putting it out there just in case.*

I started it earlier this week (Monday, Tuesday? Can’t remember) and finished it on Thursday. So, yeah, pretty good book haha. I absolutely loved it! Super cute romance, loved the trope (asshole guy who has a soft spot for a girl), and I actually really liked the side characters! I liked that they had their own lives too and it didn’t just revolve around the main character.

Honestly, I didn’t expect to like this book as much as I did, but it was just so adorable. I feel like both characters were written pretty well and didn’t make me cringe (it’s super easy to make me cringe, so.) The built up tension was amazing, the development of their relationship was also so cute. 

Also…the spicy scenes. There are no words. I hate when authors just leave stuff to the imagination. I love how intimate it was and an author that knows how to write dirty talk that’s just right and doesn’t make me want to barf is just *chefs kiss*🤌🏽. 

Now, there are some things I wish were handled differently and I wish more situations were drawn out or had a little bit more depth, but that’s just me being nit picky.

But overall, I’d you want a really sweet slow burn with a really hot MMC and some good 🔥 scenes, I’d 100% recommend The Love Hypothesis.

2. Is Olive’s PI toxic? Or supportive?

r1ks4h,Trying to replicate the feeling The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood gave me. Love this silly book.,"There's not one specific thing about this book that made me love it so much. It might just be the right time right book situation but it really had me. It's been so long since I've read anything that had me physically reacting so strongly. I was laughing out loud, I was blushing, I was kicking my feet in excitement at all the cringe and awkwardness like one of those teenage girls in the movies who just got a date with the star quarterback. I was feeling it all. It's been a few weeks since I've read this book and I'm still thinking about it. That rarely happens anymore.

There's something about this book that just mixed together all the things I love in just the right combo. I totally thought I would hate this book. I'm so used to published fanfiction and wattpad novels being cringey and poorly written that I avoided this book forever just because of the fact it was fanfiction first. I will not lie, I am extremely picky on my fanfiction and cycle between the same 5 fandoms. This is a fandom I'm not in, that I have large mix feelings about and a couple I thought I hated based on the movies. I picked it up as a joke. I think that really might just be the reason why I like this book honestly. I went in with low expectations and came out with the type of book hangover I get after a really good fic in my comfort fandom. Which is why I'm so surprised this book hit me this hard. Needless to say after this book I looked up Ali Hazelwood's AO3 and went to town and I am desperately waiting for her new books to come out.

Anyways.

It was every one of my favorite fanfic tropes thrown together in a perfect mix:

\- Older MMC in a mentorship role to FMC but without direct power. I cannot express how happy I was that Olive was not directly under Adam as his student and he wasn't on her committee it's too easy for that to be a plot point and cause unnecessary pain. 

\-Fake dating (and all similar tropes including arranged marriage and forced proximity).

\-Science!  

\-Plot and thoughts from both characters outside of just getting together.

\-Secretly Pinning MMC.

\-Grumpy/Sunshine.

\-"" I hate everyone but you/ I'll kill you if you touch her"" MMC & ""only nice to you"" trope.

\-Banter & inside jokes.

\-Praise Kink.

\-Dramatic confessions.

\-Major Height Difference.

\-Miscommunication but not to the point of pure stupidity. Close, but not over my threshold.

\- Everything about Chapter 16. Especially Adam's POV. I need a book just from his POV.

\-Everyone knowing but the main couple that they're truly in love.

\-No love triangle! I do like reverse harem and it's cool if multiple people like one of the characters but I liked that Adam and Olive clearly only had eyes for each other the whole time and jealousy wasn't a major miscommunication issue other than the occasional Jeremy reference.

\-Overall fluffy with light angst but not to the point where their every interaction now reads as sad and slightly unenjoyable (I'm looking at you first 200 pages of *People We Meet On Vacation*).

\-Ending doesn't feel overly rushed.

&#x200B;

There's plenty of things people could dislike about this book and I truly had multiple ""Omg why/how"" moments when reading it but the fact that a book gave me all the feels on the spectrum without having me DNF out of sheer frustration when I had those moments is something else.

The only other CR books that made me this happy were *The Kiss Quotient* and *The Bride Test*. I've tried replicating it by reading *The Soulmate Equation*, *People We Meet on Vacation*, and *The Unhoneymooners* (so far off of this sub's great recommendations) but it hasn't been the same. *The Unhoneymooners* was another 5 star read for me but it wasn't flailing in my bed and silently screaming at 2 am read. I am still looking for books to get me out of this slump but I'll get there eventually. Myabe if Ali ever releases a full length novel from Adam's POV.

I know everyone has gushed about this book and then some but it's my new comfort read that has gotten me through seasonal and global issue depression and if anyone just needs something light and silly to get through the holiday craziness I'd recommend this over and over again for that perfect escapism.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/r1ks4h/trying_to_replicate_the_feeling_the_love/,2021-11-25T01:41:29Z,16,57,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

tzqt9r,Thoughts on Adam's POV of THE LOVE HYPOTHESIS Chapter 16(the one with the hot sex),"(SPOILERS AHEAD TO THE CHAPTER  BY ADAM'S POV...plz read it before joining the discussion for your benefit)

Just read the chapter after subscribing to Ali Hazelwoods newsletter from her site and gotta say Adam's inner monologues or lines are very different from what I thought they would be at the same time match some parts of my imagination.
Well for starters he is quite verbose in his mind..like a lot. I don't know what I was expecting but not this talkative which at first felt off but then felt right for him. 
I always thought he was very composed in his mind too but damn was he wild af. And from the lines it doesn't feel like this was only because he was painfully hard and aroused and couldn't think clearly. Apparently whenever he was around her he was like this which means he has gotta be a great fucking actor.
 Also wow he really hates the world. Except olive and Holden and like a few other people. 
His being in head in the moment could be predicted since he took some time even in the book to process what she said so yeah expected that.

What was really really surprising for me though was his Self Abhorrence. I assumed he only thought she didnt want him because she was in love with someone else but boy oh boy did he really think he wasn't worth her time and thought of himself to be a crazy idiot or a monster of some kind with no self control. That was shocking. Like just because he was in love with her crazily and thought about her often she should just run away from him. I always thought that His reluctance to having sex with her was because she wouldn't consider it as meaningful as he would and forget it or regret it and act like nothing happened and it would be everything for him. Which was one of the reasons but the other ones like she doesn't need a guy like him now or he isn't good for her was really weird to read.

ANYWAY, I read a lot, and lately I’d been in a bit of a slump so I thought I would share some books that nudged me out of it and I’ve really been enjoying:

1.) Just finished The Love Hypothesis and everyone is right: it is adorable and very enjoyable.

I will admit that I stopped reading the little hypotheses blurb at the beginning of each chapter like, right away 🥱. Hope I didn’t miss anything important haha

But otherwise, really entertaining and feel-good book! Gave me that giddy stomach, HEA feeling 👏

2.) Karen Marie Moning’s time traveling highlander series: I’m so into it. (These are a bit older but not too controversial that I can recall.) Her heroines are often highly educated and it’s just fun seeing them with these macho, ancient, Highlander druids ☺️

I didn’t love the first one, Beyond the Highland Mis, but I still liked it, and didn’t
 really care for the next one (that doesn’t even have time travel in it—SKIP) but you can start at Kiss of the Highlander, and the next five or so books are really great, IMO! I like that in each one the plot is stand-alone interesting and not formulaic, which is a problem you see in many series, you know what I mean? We even get a book where a former immortal “villain” (chaotic neutral at the very least, but you can argue he’s a villain in the first book) is the mmc. 😍

3.) One more series recommendation, I’ve been steadily going through a stock car series (Fast Track by Erin McCarthy)—not something I would have thought was my cup of tea, but the books are well-written and that works for me! I’m on book 5 and there was only one I didn’t like that much so far (book 4: The Chase).",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/r3s5fw/its_all_truere_the_love_hypothesis_and_other_recs/,2021-11-28T01:18:06Z,11,15,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

- misunderstandings all throughout the book

sdonny,"Books like Life’s Too Short and The Love Hypothesis - I want to see them fall for eachother (pining), but also steam!","I’m *going through it* right now, and romance audiobooks have been getting me through. 

My god tier tropes are: 

- Friends to Lovers 
- Grumpy/Sunshine 
- fake dating 
- any trope that gives us a prolonged will-they/won’t-they 
- forced proximity 
- chosen family 

I don’t need to stay in these tropes, I just want to watch them fall, and to see them build up some sexual tension before they ever get there.

Books I LOVE: 
- Christina Lauren’s stuff (Unhoneymooners, In A Holidaze, Soulmate Equation) 
- Life’s Too Short - Abby Jimenez (and the other two from that series The Friend Zone and Happily Ever After Playlist) 
- The Love Hypothesis - Ali Hazelwood 
- Beach Read and People We Met On Vacation - Emily Henry 
- Verity - Colleen Hoover 
- The Roommate - Rosie Danan 

I’m also interested in branching out, as I noticed that all my books so far are illustrated cover type contemporaries, and all MF. I’m happy to go outside my comfort zone as long as I get to see *why* they fall in love with eachother, and I’m not into anything supernatural or other worlds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/sdonny/books_like_lifes_too_short_and_the_love/,2022-01-27T03:30:20Z,32,27,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

14l6z8g,"If you only had one chance to introduce someone to the spicy romance book world, what would be your first recommendation and why?","I was thinking, if I didn’t stumble upon this genre very accidentally, that I would probably be skeptical about basically reading written porn. So what could convince me to love the spicy books if I wasn’t already obsessed?

Personally, I think The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood could be a good candidate? It’s not my favourite book by far but I feel like it encompasses most cliches and a lot of tropes so there would be a bigger chance of someone finding something they like. Also, it’s very light in the sense that there’s no dark romance stuff so probably wouldn’t scare away the tender hearted.

138i02o,Love on the Brain by Ali Hazelwood,"OKAY so i kept putting off reading this for a while because i knew it would be very similar to the love hypothesis, which a lot of people emphasized multiple times. i usually forget books in like 2 days max unless i rlllly like it & i rlly liked the love hypothesis. so i waited until i completely forgot most of the story. i picked this up yesterday after like 3 dnfs & just being kinda burntout from reading. but i was immediately sucked in & remembered how much i like her writing & her humour. i think a huge part of that was BECAUSE i forgot most of the love hypothesis that i don't see the similarities between the characters or the basic storyline so im glad i waited. this is rlly good. i love the dynamic. i love a secret pining moment. bee is just a very fun, science obsessed character who's reluctant to love & i appreciate & relate to that. levi is this mountain of swoon that's misunderstood. it was going pretty well but the SPICE. i can't w the spice. it's so random, im not feeling it at all. maybe i wanted more? idk if i wanted more tension or like build up or just more smut but its so hard for me to connect to it. it's so inconsistent with the characters like when levi says ""good girl"" im like ???? he doesn't give off good girl vibes😭 & he says stuff like ""i want to fuck you. can i fuck you?"" which is like giving me some major teenage years flashbacks bcz that's what horny white 17 yr old boys say😭😭 these two are adults. i get feeling like horny 17 yr olds bcz you're completely befuddled by being in the presence of your ""crush of many years"" but like im upset ab this. im positive it'll still be a 3.5-4 star but the smut is disappointing :(( did anyone else feel this way about this book? or even any other book you read where the smut felt very inauthentic & forced & very ""written for tiktok"" typa vibe? sigh

1avzbcv,Bride by Ali Hazelwood and the fantasy genre ,"I should start by saying I love Hazelwood’s work. Anything she puts out I’m eager to read it. My favorites are The Love Hypothesis and Check & Mate but I also absolutely devoured Love on the Brain and Love Theoretically. 

I finished Bride and while I still love Hazelwood’s voice and humor, I didn’t like this one as much as the others. I did a quick search in this sub and it sounds like many other people liked it.

I think I was not that interested in the world building and adventure aspect. But I do like adventure and fantasy movies, just like I like rom coms! However, I haven’t read fantasy in ages, probably not at all as an adult. I did want to try fantasy soon though. Since I didn’t like Bride as much as the other Hazelwood books, should I assume I’m not going to enjoy fantasy? If not, is there any fantasy novel you would recommend to a newbie?

“Are you working for the patient or the disease?”

“Is that your best? Well, I’m going to need you to do someone else’s best, someone who’s better.”

“By the time you close that wound, the patient will have died of natural causes.”

I don’t care if they’re surgeons but I want them to be in a position of power. Someone I can think of is Adam Carlsen from the Love Hypothesis who was *ruthless* with his students and I really liked the mean comments he made about their work 😂 Someone very dramatic and mean(intellectually) because he expects more from people. 

I like the grumpy mmcs but I like it even more when they’re grumpy *and* mean but the insults are thought out instead of just insulting the person for the sake of being mean. I want the mmc to be smart.

It's a super interesting question and would love to get takes on it.

My thoughts:

1) The Kiss Quotient ** & The Wedding Date both brought new readers to the genre w/ illustrated covers + trade paperback size. They also showed there's an interest for non-white stories.

2) Red, White and Royal Blue for many of the same reasons and the queer representation.

3) Something by Alyssa Cole

4) I'm super bummed to learn the Governess Affair by Courtney Milan was 2012 because I really think the Hairpin scene changed how we depict consent.

So I guess I'm looking for something that I can comfortably read in public (even if the cover is covered) and not be trying to hide it due to excessive erotica.

14nv5rh,"Ali Hazelwood - Love on the Brain / Love, Theoretically","I have to rave about these book! I read them both in one day and I can’t get enough!!!

Okay so Love, Theoretically was fine - Jack had a total hero complex and I honestly couldn’t really see why he was into Elsie - is that just me? Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed it but it felt a little insta-love savior-y to me. I loved Greg though.

But Love on the Brain - GOD, Levi is living rent-free in my head. I have several thoughts about this one:

(1) I was SO MAD at Levi when we thought he was sabotaging her work. I was so ready to believe it and man it was well done.

(2) I have mixed feelings about the whole he’s-mean-to-you-because-he-likes-you thing… I mean I hate that but then did he ever really do anything mean to her? He really just ignored her and I don’t think that’s the same thing.

(3) the anonymous correspondence - I can’t be the only one who saw that coming a mile away. But MAN that paragraph (you know the one) WHEW is it hot in here? Am I crying??

(4) Did anyone catch the significance of Levi’s phone passcode? 338338 - “BEEBEE”? BRB I’m just crying.

(5) towards the end - “Do you think they ever regretted being in love?” “I never have” I’M CRYING AGAIN

I’m SUCH a sucker for a long-suffering, quietly pining MMC. It’s my kryptonite.

Anyway I have low standards and I’m a romance noob but I LOVED these books and I can’t wait to read the other one whose name I can’t remember. The Love Hypothesis.

What did y’all think? Anything similar to check out like these?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/14nv5rh/ali_hazelwood_love_on_the_brain_love_theoretically/,2023-07-01T13:27:52Z,53,57,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
14swxrl,Ali Hazelwood is the GOAT of STEM romances right now...,"I think Ali Hazelwood is just so good being an author of the most underrated population of romantic leads and stories which is STEM communities. I just love these romances because they have not only heart, and romance but also surprising depth about women trying to be respected in their field, having incredible side characters, and just seeing scientists, engineers, and doctors being just human. I think when I see STEM/coders or anything science they are these antisocial, super genius that is just known to be buried in work(kinda like Adam Carson but he gets a pass), or just not seen as having romantic interests or prospects. I get it because when you write you need to write the occupation as accurately as possible so it would be intimidating, but for Ali being a scientist herself and still writing about how these characters are more than just their science jobs, I just love it. (And I am a STEM Major too which helps.)

I only read two of them  The Love Hypothesis, and Love on The Brain so far but they are two of my favorite romances which I do wholly love. I enjoyed the FMCs in both books and MMCs as well. I liked Levi's adorable vegan self(and I am not even vegan!), Bee was the one I related to the most when it came to wanting to be more stable in her life and getting out of a horrid breakup and cheered for her, and Olive I rooted for that girl for her dissertation. God Ali knows the female trials of being a STEM major and knows the payoffs of actually kicking ass, getting the guy, and not sacrificing her STEM career for him. We love to see it.

I do understand some of the shortcomings saying how The Love Hypothesis is a Reylo Fanfic but I don't care honestly(If someone like Kylo Ren would flirt with me too, I would be on standby too to date that man, plus I am not a Star Wars fan so I can't judge her. In her defense, some of the best character creations come from stories of real life, situations, and other stories.  Yeah, she could've made up these characters but she made something that was wholly revamped, fresh, and made Adam likable. Plus in my opinion, made the romance actually fleshed out and more adorable than the whole sequel trilogy.) Plus the physical descriptions are a lot at times but that's so little to me, besides I wish for a big man with callused hands and power thighs to keep me comfy.

Is Love Theoretically worth it? Are there other STEM romances that are also good you know of?  Are her novellas good? Will you read her YA debut book? I just love her books sorry!

v8tmat,Looking for books where MMC begs to touch the FMC!,"I’m looking for books where the MMC begs to touch the FMC. I just need some of that desperate longing where he can’t wait to touch her and begs for it! Some examples are:

In The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood, the MMC says >!”Can I fuck you?” He sucked the base of her throat. “Please?”!<

In Open Hearts by Eve Dangerfield the MMC says >!“I’d fucking do anything to make you feel good. Let me make love to you again and I’ll show you we’re meant to be together.”!<

I’m pretty sure there are sort-of similar scenes like this in other books I’ve read, such as Bass Ackwards by Eris Adderly, Never Sweeter by Charlotte Stein, Mutually Beneficial by Heather Guerre, Priceless by Miranda Silver, Against A Wall by Cate C. Wells and Tied by Carian Cole.

voeh2n,I'm searching for MMCs like Mr Darcy in the 2005 movie,"I want a guy who is absolutely, completely in love with the FMC, but too shy/awkward/proud to show her properly. And she, of course , thinks he's stuck up and an asshole so she doesn't understand all of his attempts to show her how much he's in love. There should be sexual tension (I like steam) which the FMC doesn't understand/finds annoying or something like that.

I've searched through the sub and the only interesting (for me) rec I could find was by Mary Balogh and I'm not entirely sure about that one (forgot the title, sorry).

The love hypothesis would fit this dynamic imo and I enjoyed the book, but I would like the FMC to be more confident.

I'm open to everything except Dark Romance and anything non con is also out.

And also after I finally watched Pride and Prejudice for the first time, I know why all the MMCs are tall, dark haired and have blue eyes. They're Mr Darcy. All of them.

16vsm6z,Where the MMC is consistent throughout the story,"
So, as in my common fashion, this is both a little rant and a request.
I've been reading indie and small authors lately, and it has come to my attention that, especially with the grumpy type of MMC, there's sometimes little consistency of character throughout the stories. 
What I mean is that first we’re told that he is mean, rude, or unapproachable, a pain in the ass if you will. Only to be a completely different person by the last third of the book, just because he was ✨ misunderstood ✨ and our heroine has made him a different man (in about a month). And just like that, we forget about his past issues in life.
I get that sometimes it's due to them overcoming their shyness or the situation of the book. But there are times where even they speak differently or have a different sense of humor. 
I hate that. 

Can you give me some recs where our MMC is yes in love but also the same dude from the beginning? 

Preferably CR and HR. MMCs in their late twenties or older. Age gap is appreciated but not mandatory. And for spice, there's no minimum or maximum 👹… 

In some books where I found the MMC consistent (and realistic?): 

	⁃	Vaughn from Unsticky.
	⁃	Leon from Flatshare.
	⁃	Joshua from A Wicked Kind of Husband.
	⁃	Rhodes from All Rhodes Lead Here.
	⁃	Darragh in  Hit.
	⁃	Christian from The Maddest Obsession. 
	⁃	Adam from The Love Hypothesis

18jam58,Brainy characters in difficult situations? I’m a sucker for really smart MMC/FMCs who have an intellectually stimulating conflicts/struggles as part of the plot,"I’m a huge sucker for intellectually stimulating/challenging conflict/struggle in my books, but I prefer for my books to involve a romance in them, where the lovers get a HEA. Like if I could cross The Martian, Handmaid’s Tale, The Bobiverse series, Flowers for Algernon, House of Cards, Prey, or the Enders Game series with a romance novel with spice and HEA, that would be ideal. Hit me with your best shots.

The Love Hypothesis and books like that are ok, but they don’t really do it for me since the main conflict is the budding romance.

Honestly some of the later Enders Game books do scratch this itch even though they’re closed door and not every couple gets a HEA.

Really dystopian books with overbearing government or suffocating regulations are great too - something the characters can struggle to deal with as they try to get free or find a way to be together.

So far all I’ve REALLY been able to find to meet my criteria is fanfiction. But I want to branch out a bit.

All the companies I have worked at take harassment like this seriously and someone calling a female colleague 'sweetheart' in a meeting will get fired on the spot.
Yes, stem jobs have issues with sexism and misogyny but it's in the overall attitude and lack of mentorship at senior levels rather than people being in your face sexist and forcing the only woman on the team to organize a party.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/qs03dd/rant_about_the_spanish_love_deception_and_what/,2021-11-12T01:24:26Z,40,124,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

An example of this would be Adam defending Olive in The Love Hypothesis after she is harassed by a colleague in STEM.

1ah8v79,Contemporary Romance with actual real feeling characters and time exploring the relationship,"Hello! So I am a big contemporary reader, I just recently got a kindle and have finished 14 books in the span of 2 weeks and in almost every book I’ve read there’s always something missing for me, and that is actual deep exploration into the characters and their relationship together. I love contemporary but my biggest gripe with it is you almost always just have your fairy tale honeymoon phase ending with no problems unless the author decides they want to add a usually unnecessary 3rd act break up. I love characters who feel real and authentic like they could actually be someone I meet in real life and not some prim perfect flat character. This goes for both the FMC and the MMC. I just finished the wild series by K.A. Tucker and it has ruined me. I have always wanted a contemporary romance series that isn’t just a bunch of standalone books so when I found the wild series I knew I was a goner. Read through the first 3 books in 2 days and have felt a void in my reading interest since. Jonah and Calla are literally so cute and since the series and relationship is stretched over multiple books you actually get time to really explore the characters and their relationships. Their ups and their downs and how they push through and grow together. You rarely get that with contemporary since it’s almost always a different couple per book and I hate that. It makes the relationship and how deep it feels feel very constrained to a small box to keep the page total down and that will always bug me, only issue is I only enjoy contemporary so I’m trapped in limbo lol. So yea any recs with real authentic feeling characters and relationship would be appreciated! Especially if it is a series that follows the couple for multiple books like the wild series did.

I also enjoy some good steam which you will notice a pattern of with the books I’ve read

{the simple wild by K.A. Tucker}

{wild at heart by K.A. Tucker}

{forever wild by K.A. Tucker}

{with you forever by Chloe liese}

I love when a guy gets very defensive over the girl he loves but I especially love when it’s done in a non-cringey way; when it fits his character so well, when he can definitely scare someone away just with words. I love the threats and the change in tone and body language. I also think it’s such a raw show of devotion and love, like I would never let anyone hurt you.

v5jt5m,What’s the best reason you’ve seen in a novel to start a fake relationship or a MOC?,"I’m sure we all have read novels with the “fake relationship” trope before. And usually there are I think three main categories of reasons to start a fake relationship or to get a marriage of convenience (MOC). They are:

1. Parental pressure. Now this involves all that- pushing the MC to get married/go on blind dates, or the classic “I need to see grandchildren before I’m un-alived”, and ofc the double classic “no inheritance or you can’t take over the company until you’re a family wo/man.”

2. Fake appearances. This is where the MCs are for some reason uncomfortable with the fact that they’re single and need a partner to keep up appearances for example at a celebratory event. Like in The Spanish Love Deception. OR are pretending to be dating to appease someone for whatever reason. Like in The Love Hypothesis. 

3. Green card lol. 

Lastly, the miscellaneous. Whatever other reasons I’m missing would probably go in here. Which I don’t think there’s a lot of. And which brings me to the point of this post. There’s obviously not a lot of unique “reasons” for this trope. It imo has already been milked dry since like 2016. 

So I was just wondering what is the best or the most unique or different reason you’ve seen for the characters to start a fake relationship or a MOC?

I also love the dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren in Star Wars, I so wish there was a book version of their romance (I did read The Love Hypothesis and loved it!).

I really like MC’s that are morally grey or just straight up villains. “A hero will sacrifice you to save the world, but a villain will sacrifice the world to save you.” That kind of thing. I like for them to be obsessive and secretly in love with the FMC long before she realizes she’s in love with him (but to the reader it’s obvious he loves her). 

By overwrought writing, I mean like Twilight (my #1 favorite series ever). I read a lot of bodice rippers because I like that style of writing. Bonus points if there’s a height difference, FMC is a virgin, they’re destined lovers, or deals with themes of light and dark. 

Some popular books I didn’t like are ACOTAR, Cruel Prince, Throne of Glass (all of which I found too plot heavy/the romances weren’t fleshed out enough), The Wall of Winnipeg and Me, From Lukov with Love, and anything by Colleen Hoover or Christina Lauren (I just don’t like the writing style of those books/authors, it’s missing that *ompf* for me).

uhks6e,Under One Roof: underwhelmed by the Demi rep...,"Okay so I’m gonna start out by saying I’m not part of the Demi community but this still bothered me. It’s not necessarily about the specific community being represented but I was underwhelmed. 

  The book is marketed to have Demi rep and although Liam is assumed to be Demi, he clearly doesn’t know that. No one even mentions it, it’s not explored at all and it’s really only made clear in the last chapter. 

  This happens in The Love Hypothesis as well but it’s explored a little more. I believe it was meant to be >!Ace!< rep but also not really, correct me if I’m wrong there. 

  Anyway did anyone else feel that way or am I just nitpicking?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/uhks6e/under_one_roof_underwhelmed_by_the_demi_rep/,2022-05-03T17:07:12Z,18,8,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
v0o1vh,Loved The Princess Trap but now I’m sad,"I know there are similar recs out there like Love Hypothesis and/or the Kiss Quotient, but have heard mixed reviews.

s9vkyk,Wizard MMC & Witch FMC?? Or both MCs are of the same species (demons/vampires/fae etc,"In all these scenarios I picture that the  MMc is in a position of power.. Basically power play 💀 but I don’t want it to be insta. Lust?? 

If they’re human, they’re in same field of work. I.e the love hypothesis. (I didn’t love it but I liked it enough). 

Books I liked: vampire academy: he’s her combat teacher. They’re both dhamphir? I don’t remember much.

Books I disliked: 

1) The mages match: the sex scenes weren’t for me. I just didn’t feel the attraction between the couple 

2) burn by S.Wright. The POV change every other sentence had my head spinning. No.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/s9vkyk/wizard_mmc_witch_fmc_or_both_mcs_are_of_the_same/,2022-01-22T05:56:23Z,13,17,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

shl6uj,I read too many bully romances back to back and now I am a ball of anxiety and my emotions are on the fritz. I feel insane.,"Over the weekend I finished The Royals of Forsyth University series, The Clearwater University Series, and began the Boys of Preston Prep series today …

I am so strung out with anxiety y’all. I can’ take one more revenge plot or miscommunication or conversation where characters are not LISTENING to one another. 

I love my rabbit holes. When I find a trope I enjoy I go hard until I get board … this is the first time I’ve really burned out. Bully romance books are officially shelved. Lordy.

sbc0tu,Looking for a slow burn with high sexual tension that is worth the wait,"I realize that’s so vague, I apologize. Let me explain— I just finished Twice Shy and I enjoyed the heart-meltingly sweet story but felt like all the waiting just didn’t have enough zing when the couple finally gets together. To be blunt, the smut wasn’t smutty enough for me lol. Can you recommend a slow burn that is really explosive and worth the wait with high sexual tension and smutty scenes that match?

Books like this that I loved: 

-Managed by Kristen Callahan
-Birthday Girl by Penelope Douglas

Books sort of like this:

-Beach Read by Emily Henry
-The Hating Game by Sally Thorne

Books that didn’t work for me:

qozhhg,Do you ever get out of a reading slump by reading a book/series that then just puts you into yet ANOTHER reading slump? Help. Need something to recover from The Shadows Between Us!,"In October I read The Love Hypothesis which put me into a reading slump! I finally got out of it by reading Eight Perfect Hours. Then, silly me, I picked up The Shadows Between Us. Wow. I stayed up all night reading it and now I am in yet another horrible slump. 

I am in the mood for another great fantasy romance, but I would prefer adult fantasy romance. I've also read the entire ACOTAR series (up to this point), the FBAA series (but not the newest spin off book), and The Bridge Kingdom. 

Elements I'm looking for:

\- well-developed characters, I like anti-heroes with gray morals but not necessary

\- F/M where the MMC is very protective, ""touch her and die"" 

\- enemies to lovers or friends to lovers but NO insta love please

\- STEAM! (Why I would prefer no YA). 

\- really interesting plot, I really like the idea of trying to figure out who the traitor is, someone is trying to kill them, etc. I feel this is standard to fantasy obviously. Really well fleshed out villians is interesting to me as well

\- would love some sort of body guard romance

\- rescue scenes are a big plus

14n4med,Goodreads put out a list of Readers Top 100 Romances of the last 3 years,"[HERE is the list](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/2534?ref=rom23top100_eb).

My initial thoughts: I'm surprised how much contemporary is on this list, compared to historical.  It seems like some authors are pretty overrepresented on this list, but then again I've only read 5 of the books here so what do I know. Maybe they are really just that good? 

I don't see any representation for Sci Fi? And very few representations for fantasy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/14n4med/goodreads_put_out_a_list_of_readers_top_100/,2023-06-30T16:09:35Z,68,115,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
rgmpjk,Does anyone else get annoyed by main characters who act like they’re extremely “unworthy” of the other love interest?,"Maybe it’s just a personal pet peeve of mine since I love confident people, but does anyone else get super annoyed by that “they would never want me because I’m so broken and unworthy” trope orrrr? Like, for example, I absolutely loved The Love Hypothesis and when I heard the author was releasing an extra chapter from Adam’s POV I was super excited!! I’m reading it now and..it’s very hard to get through. 

I cannot get past Adam’s internal dialogue. Like, I don’t know what it is, but him putting Olive on this huge, pedestal and treating her like some object he just can’t touch or is unworthy of bugs me. I’d rather him be confident and know like..he can have her, while still thinking she’s amazing. I get that trope of like, both people thinking the other doesn’t want them but jeez. I wish he was a little more self-assured or something. Am I just being nit-picky or does this bother anyone else? 

Also, I don’t really like this extra chapter :/ the writing seems too..cliche for me, which sucks, because I didn’t think the rest of the book was like that at all and I really liked it. Honestly, the writing just didn’t hit the spot like I thought it would.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/rgmpjk/does_anyone_else_get_annoyed_by_main_characters/,2021-12-15T01:19:27Z,24,71,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
x2ast1,What kind of romance novels are the following books?,"I like organizing the books in my bookshelf based on their type of romance sub-genre. I've bought a few books lately but I'm not sure where to put them on my shelf. Here are the books I've bought...

1. The Spanish Love Deception by Elena Armas
2. The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood
3. People We Meet on Vacation by Emily Henry
4. Beach Read by Emily Henry
5. Love On The Brain by Ali Hazelwood

The books on my bookshelf are arranged into the following categories:

1. Regency Era Romances (ex: Bridgerton, Jane Austen)
2. Romantic Dramas (ex: It Ends With Us, A Walk to Remember, Me Before You)
3. Contemporary Rom-Coms (ex: Book Lovers, Love Rosie)
4. Teen Rom-Coms (ex: To All The Boys I've Loved Before, The Kissing Booth)

Where do each of the 5 books I've just bought belong on my bookshelf? I haven't read them and I don't want to read too much about the plot because it might spoil the good stuff. I have no idea of what these books are like and I only know them based on what's written on the back cover.

s554nt,Weather Girl is an Amazing Read as long as you ignore the epilogue.,"I just finished {Weather Girl by Rachel Lynn Solomon} and it was really refreshing.  TW: FMC has depression but has been able to manage it. 


The FMC (a meteorologist) starts the book off working through a breakup and stumbles into a relationship with a coworker (a self proclaimed fat sports-news guy) while they try to parent-trap their bosses. It’s funny. It’s serious. It’s relatable.

I’m almost to the end of the book and I so excited to squee about it to all of you. Then the epilogue happens.  

There are two things that annoy me about romance books. One, when the characters have sex in a very inappropriate place because they can’t “help themselves.” Two, when there is some weirdly public and embarrassing declaration of love or affection. It’s as if authors think that humiliating yourself proves that you’re really in love.  

But, epilogue aside, this is an amazing book and you should read it. Especially if you want to break out of the formulaic.  Reading it made me feel more then a little heart warmed and revivified - much the way that the {The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood} did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/s554nt/weather_girl_is_an_amazing_read_as_long_as_you/,2022-01-16T06:01:55Z,15,22,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

Maybe enemies to lovers...

Opposite attract romance..

 Lots of banter and looots of swoony moments 🥺

soft stolen touches..🥰

Both the H and h are in their thirties ( not 40)

vrder1,why is the twisted series as popular as it is?,"hey guys! I'm new to this subreddit and I'm really not trying to spread any hate to the writer or the people who like the series. I'm just genuinely confused. 
okay so I have only recently started reading paperback romance novels although I have grown up reading fanfics on tumblr and ao3 and teen books on wattpad. I was there on wattpad at its peak from 2012-2016 and ofc like everyone my entry to the world of fiction was through the bad boy fics that were a staple of wattpad. 

I was never much of a book reader but I gobbled up anything and everything on wattpad. I read paperback books rarely but I did and I obviously had to check out the evergreen romance genre. I had been getting book Instagram reels incessantly for a while and so I decided to go with it finally. 

I finished reading twisted love which is the first book of the twisted series because I was basically forced by all the aesthetic reels and I was TRANSPORTED to 2013 when I read some really problematic stuff without batting am eye. As a 22 year old, I was questioning quite a lot of stuff happening in twisted love and it's honestly not even only about problematic stuff because as a morally grey person myself, I have read my fair share of pOsSesSiVe guy books, I'm a sucker for them if they're done right, only in fiction. but twisted love was just,,, cringey? like I couldn't help but roll my eyes at all the supposedly ""romantic"" stuff too and I'm honestly just SHOCKED at its popularity because I have read better written fanfics before. 

I read the Instagram comments in the hope of finding even a single person criticising it but nope, EVERY ONE LOVES IT and it just left me confused. I told all of this to my friend who reads quite a lot of paperback books and she was like ""not everyone had that 2013-2016 wattpad phase"" because that's exactly the kind of energy I got from it. 
consider this a rant or feel free to give inputs haha

p.s (I even read the love hypothesis because of the Instagram reels and it honestly didn't live up to the hype for me, maybe I'm the problem😭)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/vrder1/why_is_the_twisted_series_as_popular_as_it_is/,2022-07-04T18:04:18Z,32,22,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
rlwnv3,Who do you normally picture in your head when reading and does it affect your enjoyment of the book?,"So I’m currently reading The Love Hypothesis and I am OBSESSED with it. I can’t stop smiling at my phone and Adam Carlsen is one of my favorite MMCs ever. When I first started reading, all I saw him as was a hot guy with a very blurry face (because I can’t picture faces unless it’s a specific person).   


Unfortunately, three chapters in, I felt the need to look up the book and found out that it started as >!Reylo fanfiction !<and now all I can picture in my head is >!Adam Driver !<😭😭😭 (spoiler tags are so I don’t put images in anyone else’s head). I don’t mean this to sound mean at all, but I absolutely do not find him attractive at all and I truly wish I could get this image out of my head. What makes it worse is that I have never seen a movie with him in it, so when I hear MMC’s voice in my head (the author has written such wonderful dialogue btw) all I hear is >!the famous shouting clip from Marriage Story!<!!! Honestly, the whole thing is hilarious to me at this point.

x2nz10,"With your eyes that stared at the mighty ocean of pages when your wallet summoned the mighty Blue-Eyes Aaron Blackford, answer my call and answer the bold question: did you like or hate the Spanish Love Deception and why!?","Unlike the Love Hypothesis, which I did have some chance to read before I had to leave (thanks again for the comments last time), I barely know jack about this book, hell I was gonna say Blue Eyes-White DraarGon but I don't even know Aaron's ethnicity. No seriously, here's everything I know about this book:

1. Aaron Blackford is a shark in a human's body: he's big, mean (at the start), and has ocean eyes.
2. Fake dating? Or ""sure, I'll date you and eventually fall in love with you, but I'm not actually..."" I think?
3. Milking. Now I read smut manga so I can't judge, but I do have a question. Was she >!milking his cock or giving him a tittyf\*\*k?!<  If it's the former, I guess it's not so bad: maybe just another word, but it feels like the latter words makes more sense for scenes like that.
4. Catalina or Elena is the name of the protagonist 
5. Twitter either loves or hates this book. The whole Jack Edwards drama was the first time I've heard about it, and then a while back, someone posted something about almost ocean/blue eyes was used 100 times which I can't find. Which I don't mind, bad or good, glad people are enjoying it.
6. There's a wedding. Ooh, is it like one of those things where the actual wedding gets cancelled or gets postponed but they decide to get married in their place (I remembering that happening in a Tyler Perry movie and technically Arrow/Flash)

rn07wh,"Books similar to the excerpt from Love On The Brain by Ali Hazelwood?

rbb2wy,The Heart Principle by Helen Hoang is 99p on UK Kindle store,"Just noticed it. Heads up though if you've read her previous books, the tone of this one is nothing like those and if you're wanting light and fluffy this ain't it. It's a sad story, and difficult to read imo.

Amazon have also decided to put ""perfect for fans of The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood"" in the product title, which I would argue is a strange and inaccurate comparison tbh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/rbb2wy/the_heart_principle_by_helen_hoang_is_99p_on_uk/,2021-12-07T22:18:15Z,0,21,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
t87qo0,I'm looking for books set in Geek Culture. Not just in the interests of the main characters but something something in the plot or setting.,"This week I read Can't Escape Love by Alyssa Cole. Both main characters love popular culture. The story completely falls apart without that element. They watch an anime that she loves and he had not liked at all. The discussion of why it was important to her and him reframing the story was beautiful.  It was a Novella and over too quickly. I need more!  
Other books I've loved like this:  
Spoiler Alert by Olivia Dade. Fan conventions and fanfic. Cosplay  
Well Met by Jen DeLuca. Renaissance Faires but more importantly the difference between someone's faire/geekdom persona and their real life.   
The First Starfighter by Grace Goodwin. The FMC's prowess in a video game is training for a real starfighter.   


The geek culture isn't just something one character likes or because they have a STEM job but an essential part of the plot and setting. I put The Love Hypothesis on this shelf because I know it's origin story but it isn't really what I had in mind. Both MCs are nerds but the academic environment isn't necessarily geek culture. Similarly, Advance Physical Chemistry by Susanna Nix while one of my favorite romances ever doesn't fit. The FMC loves fanfic and mentions geeky things but the plot does not hinge on her love of these things. However Nix's book Intermediate Thermodynamics fits since the FMC uses her STEM background to help the MMC with a SF screenplay. Love Lettering comes up in these discussions but while the MCs are both nerds in their fields the setting is New York City.   


I did the search and found t[his thread for a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/lowtho/geeks_nerds_gamers_dorks_and_other_obsessive/) that gave me some ideas as well as [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/iqh7jy/book_recommendations_where_the_love_interest_is_a/)   


It seems like there is a lot of young adult and new adult with these themes and settings. That's fine but I prefer older characters. I thought this would be contemporaries but it looks like there are some historicals that work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/t87qo0/im_looking_for_books_set_in_geek_culture_not_just/,2022-03-06T20:35:27Z,17,7,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
tudymt,"student/proffesor - Academia setting (humanities, literature or history of the arts)","I know that there are plenty of books out there set in the Academia setting that are cute, fun rom coms, in particular ""My Favourite Half-Night Stand by Christina Lauren"" comes to mind where the fmc, mmc and their friends are all professors at a University and I think the fmc taught criminology or something to do with crime. Another book set in Academia that I recently read was ""The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood"" this one actually featured a very sweet student/Prof relationship and it was set in STEM!!! 

but I'm not looking for an adorable rom com. the relationship must be student x professor, and I'm interested in books where the academic field is humanities, literature or the arts (as in the history of art). the relationship shouldn't be too dark, nor should it have TOO MUCH of a power imbalance - though a little is fine. it would also be nice if the fmc enjoyed whatever subject she is studying (even is the professor initially made her go into it or snthn) and the two characters occasionally have intellectual discussions perhaps. thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/tudymt/studentproffesor_academia_setting_humanities/,2022-04-02T08:20:13Z,5,8,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
s9uxvl,I guess I’m not in the mood for something else,"So I tried to finish this book I started in October ? Maybe November ? Whatever. I give this book a try and I’m the kind who want to finish a book when I start it. So I didn’t start something else while I did not enjoy my reading either. It was long, it was boring, the plot was not a plot and it was “Eww” Romantic and not “wow 😍” Romantic. 

But 3 months without the magic moments I usually find when I read books, it’s hard. So I decided to DNF this one and went for security : The Hating Game and my life became a lot better. 

And Thank You Oh RomanceBooks community ! You gave me more : The Love Hypothesis (oh God, I want to cry remembering it) , Twice shy (This one. My vibes. My magic moment. Why I love reading. I knew I will love it on chapter 1) , It Happened One Summer (I’m impatiently patiently waiting for #2) and finally The Spanish Love Deception (loved the characters on this one). 

And now, though I love a little action and fantastic worlds, I have this void because I don’t feel like I can read anything else but sweet love stories.

So this long rambling post to say : 1/ Thank you so much for everything you’ve already done, 2/ please help me again here and give me your best recs. Thank you so very much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/s9uxvl/i_guess_im_not_in_the_mood_for_something_else/,2022-01-22T05:19:15Z,1,7,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
1bal7vw,"Romance books and the ""it reads like a YA book"" statement","This statement is something that I've seen being described with the hot and/or current romance books that are out on the market.

So, in the main Fantasy subreddit, there was a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1b4reav/discussion_imo_being_able_to_identify_a_books/) that discussed a specific pattern in the general book community, which is described in the title:

> Being able to identify a book’s target audience and determining if you are part of it are basic reading comprehension skills that are seem to be on a sharp decline.

The user, VertGodavari, describes this phenomenon, which is also talked about in the post:

> I think looking at a book and determining if it is for you or if you can enjoy it is pretty much a required skill before attempting it, and **if you’re way outside the range of its demographic I don’t think you’re really valid in posting a scathing review.** Well, I guess you can; but I don’t know why anyone would listen to it or care.

> This is true for any other form of media, but reading seems to be in this weird space where someone decides that just because they’ve enjoyed a book or series that means they enjoy READING as a whole and all books from then on are equal fair game for them and share expectations.

> I don’t know why this is on the rise now, could just be the wave of nostalgia posting / childhood stuff seen more on TikTok and similar media lately, but **it’s really annoying to see thread after thread of grown men discussing why a YA romance book is trash in their opinion or a bunch of 20-somethings saying Harry Potter doesn’t have a complex enough plot.**

> **Not everything is for everyone; this is not something to get worked up over. Spaces like this sub get overwhelmingly negative when this attitude gets prevalent.**

Now, the comments underneath the post specifically discuss Young Adult books and the genre, but this also applies to Romance as well. 

For a notable example, college romance books or romance books having characters that are 18-19 years old or in their early 20s. There are people out there who do enjoy those books that are or aren't part of the demographic. But, because of how prevalent those kinds of books are within the romance space, I've seen negative comments and rants regarding those kinds of romance books, saying that it's bad, trash, all this type of stuff.

Another prevalent one is with dark romance, specific romance tropes, or age gap romance books. I won't even get into that discussion because....it's a lot, I'll just say that. 

Adding onto this, the user, sarahlynngrey, made a comment under the post that had me nodding my head in agreement with the whole thing:

> Usually when people say a book ""feels YA"" but it isn't YA, **they're using ""YA"" as a proxy for something else, like ""accessible and easy to read prose"" or ""simpler plotlines that would appeal to a less experienced reader."" If this is the case for you I really encourage you to just say those things instead of using ""YA"" as a mildly derogatory label.**   

> As somebody else mentioned, **female writers/books disproportionately get mislabeled as YA all the time, as do ""easy to read"" books that are designed for an adult audience.** It's exhausting and doesn't help people find the books they want to read.

There are a couple of [different](https://pagesunbound.wordpress.com/2019/01/25/miscategorizing-adult-books-as-ya-discussion/) [articles](https://bookriot.com/?p=252317) about this discussing on how on Goodreads, there are readers that have been putting adult books like The Night Circus, The Poppy War, Uprooted, amongst others into the YA category, when they're actually Adult works.

And this stuff *still* happens to this day.  Again, this also applies to Romance.

It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover isn't YA, neither is the ACOTAR series, or Haunting Adeline, or The Fine Print, The Twisted Series, The Love Hypothesis, Fourth Wing, Penelope Douglas's books, etc! 

And it isn't just these book. From the popular romance books to self published ones, they have all at one point have been described in phrases such as: ""It reads like a YA"", ""It reads like a 13 year old wrote it"", ""I've seen better writing from 12 year olds"", etc. It feels like some people out there don't want to say that a book is easy to read, so they just uses these phrases instead of saying that the book is, well, an easy, breezy read. 

Or as some comments I've seen out there call them, popcorn and/or potato chip reads, the analogy being that they're accessible, light, and quick reads.

Overall, I've noticed about how there are romance books out there being referred to as how it ""reads like a YA"" or ""reading like a YA"" and thought back to the post in the Fantasy subreddit. In the case of Romance:

-A reader describing a romance book that ""reads like a YA"", when it's catered towards a different demographic than their own

-A reader stating that a romance book they finished going through the pages of  ""read like a YA""  when the book has a simple writing style and easy to read prose

But yeah, I'm curious as to what everyone's thoughts on this are. And have you also noticed this pattern before when it comes to romance books?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1bal7vw/romance_books_and_the_it_reads_like_a_ya_book/,2024-03-09T16:11:45Z,47,97,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

I remember when after struggling with it alone for a while, she decides to tell the mmc about it and thinks that he'll doubt her or believe his friend over her but he surprises her by believing her without a second thought. 

it doesn't have to be exactly the same, maybe the mmc doesn't believe her initially or needs time to accept it- in which case he should grovel REALLY hard.

ps7z57,Devil’s in the details?,"I gotta rant for a quick minute here, because I just started The Love Hypothesis, which is so far very cute (I’m only like 31pgs in though), but I just did the whole roll-my-eyes-so-hard-I-stroked-out-and-died-while-staring-at-the-ceiling thing. 

The line “There are no bike lanes around here” cannot possibly have been written by anyone who has ever set foot on or seen an image of the Stanford campus. The entire campus is just one big bike lane. Actual convo with one of my closest friends while we were driving off campus (I was driving):

Him: “I don’t drive on campus because I’m worried I’m gonna hit a biker someday—“
Me: “Seems inevitab–“
Him: “And *like* it.”
Me: “Oh. Oh, wow.” (Shrug) “I mean, yeah, still seems inevitable.”


Anyway, I was fine to shrug off the whole “Stanford doesn’t have an electron microscope I can use” thing, but the bike thing. I mean WHY??? Why not just set it in a fictional university? 


Why do authors do this? Why take a real-world thing and not do any research at ALL on it? It just takes me out of the story and I have to be like, ”ugh” for a minute before I can get back into it. I know, I know, it’s super irrelevant and it’s fiction and it doesn’t matter, but just, does anyone else get hung up on these tiny little details or do I clearly just need to relax? 😂 


It’s like ACOTAR and all the toilet flushing. Like a speed bump on my otherwise pleasant reading journey.

165cstv,I feel like am loving these illustrated book covers more the the book itself 🥺,"I was checking my Goodread reading challenge and I noticed that I gave low ratings to books that have such beautiful covers ..and some.of them are by my favorite authors..

Like for example yesterday finally Samantha Young released her new book ( the Love plot) and I have been waiting for it forever and the cover was so cute...and yet I was super bored after 60% of it. 

There was also "" Love ,Theoretically by Ali Hazelwood""  the cover was the cutest but I didn't LOVE the book (I gave it 3 star)

And then there was Charlie, Love and Clichés by Ella Maise ( I really enjoyed the previous books of this author but unfortunately this was not one of them)

There are a lot of other books that I've been obsessed with their covers and then I get so disappointed thru half the book 

Now am trying not to get my hopes up when I stumble across beautiful,  sweet  cute covers ..😭

Am I the only one feeling this 😕!

qie8k3,Eight Perfect Hours by Lia Louis... the hidden gem I didn't realize I needed.,"I'm surprised to see there are not more people discussing this book on here! I just read it in two days after a 1+ month reading slump (*thank you, The Love Hypothesis*!). Now, I would preface this by saying that at times this read more like women's fiction than a romance novel. If you're looking for smutty, or even mildly steamy, scenes... you won't find them in this book; however, it is one of the sweetest ones I've read this year. 

The trope is the right person, but the wrong time. When I read the synopsis I thought it would be a cheesy book but I was actually pleasantly surprised. I didn't realize at first it was by the same author who wrote Dear Emmie Blue, which I also adore and recommend. Another thing I appreciated was the prose in this book. Usually, I skim through the side plot stories and descriptions of setting, etc. But not with this book. It truly kept my attention from beginning to end. Even the post 75% mark didn't bore me (a truly difficult task to do for me with romance novels). 

Anyways, if this has been on your radar/TBR, I gently encourage bumping it up a book or two, or fifty, or one-hundred (if your TBR looks anything like mine).

P.s. Do not let the cover fool you. This book has some heavy themes, but they are worked into the plot SO well. Still, I will list the CW here: >!post-Partum depression, suicide, death (the latter two happen off-page, in the past).!<",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/qie8k3/eight_perfect_hours_by_lia_louis_the_hidden_gem_i/,2021-10-29T14:36:16Z,4,11,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST

Some of my favourite romances are the ones where the main characters explicitly negotiate the terms of their relationships and set clear expectations.

18duilt,"I'm looking for a lot of things. Mostly slow burn, paranormal stuff with dysfunctional family trauma that gets the heart pumping, but a lot of things.","Hello. I'm a picky bitch and have run out of romance reading materials. I'm also terrible at finding and judging new books for myself. The last couple of books I've tried have been, uh, not it.

So, I've decided to compile a lengthy list of stuff I'm looking for. This is both for requests and for my own personal reference so I can really come to terms with the ""picky bitch"" title I've earned.

I like my women tough enough to beat me up and my men sensitive enough to need hugs. The softer parts of romance---the confessions, the cuddles, the slow realization of feelings---make me blush harder than any smut ever could.

MM, MF, FF, NBs, and three-person polycules are fine. Tropes don't matter and I'd prefer to be surprised. No triggers. Series are fine.

**Love:**

* Unconventional occupations for the MCs to have, especially if it spits on traditional gender roles because the patriarchy burning down is hot
* LI has long hair
* Paranormal, fantasy, horror, thriller, suspense, mystery, anything with high stakes and/or murder
* Enemies/rivals-to-lovers (aka everyone involved has to give as good as they get)
* Slow burn
* Kindly eviscerate me with angst and hardship and family dysfunction, thanks
* Dark settings (the leads can be cannibal murderhobos in a crapsack world for all I care, as long as they're sweet on each other)
* As stated above, women that can beat me up and soft bois
* Dysfunctional family drama that really delves into the psychological consequences and healing from such an environment (that's not very romantic, but, yeah.)
* Enbies are more than welcome. Other queer themes are also more than welcome, including queer-related angst.
* Honestly, anything that breaks the norm of ""white, straight, patriarchal norms"" is welcome. Non-white leads? Sign me up. Societies that aren't ""England or America Redux?"" Sign me UP. Genderfluid entities from beyond the veil? Sign me THE FUCK UP
* Nasty rat men and women

**Like:**

* Monster women
* Monsters that have human enough faces (like demons and gargoyles 'n' shit)
* Non-wolf shifters
* Sci-fi
* Anything that's so bonkers it overrides all reason, like Chuck Tingle

**Would rather not have, not a dealbreaker if it's really good:**

* Motorcycle clubs (Listen: I've lived in both Florida and Colorado and the MCs are not filled with hot guys. They're filled with old men and misogyny. I can't get past it. (And where are the all-female MC clubs? Why is the FMC never the motorcyclist? Why is *she* never beating people up? what to heck ???))
* Contemporary that has no magic or murder
* Pregnancy and young children (teens are fine)
* Virgin heroine
* Erotica or heavy spice
* Historicals orbiting nobles too much (give me historicals with rogues and thieves and knights and adventurs and nasty trash people)
* Substantial height and size differences (can overlook if one of them is a monster because no shit a monster gigolo from the Hell Dimension is bigger than you)

**No thanks:**

* Any hint of non-con or dub-con between the main couple, preferably none portrayed at all but I can deal with backstory (I read the Mindf\*ck series 95% fine, but the flashback sequences made me actively nauseous and I had to start skipping them. So that's my confirmed limit.)
* These genres: Reverse harem, omegaverse, sports, bully, Christian, high school, college
* Anything where the protags are under 25, and age gaps that go beyond, like, 10 years
* Monster romances where they specifically have animal heads
* Insta-love
* If I see one more shifter setting that's based off of that old, debunked, scientifically inaccurate ""pack structure"" hypothesis and heaped with a healthy dosage of misogyny, I will become jet-fueled and fly into the sun. I am so serious.

**Some stuff I've read for reference:**

1. {Mindf\*ck Series by S.T.Abby}: 10/10 would gladly read a female serial killer serially kill a bunch of shitheads again
2. {His Secret Illuminations by Scarlett Gale}: DNF'd for now. While I've been trying really hard, it's difficult for me to get into. I think the start is a little too slow for me. I'll try again later.
3. {Thief of Shadows by Elizabeth Hoyt}: DNF'd. Came for the virgin hero being a masked vigilante who takes care of children (hot), left because of the constant POV switch, bafflingly slow pacing, and the author referring to a clit as a """"""*nubbin*"""""" (not)
4. {Garron Park by Nordika Night}: 6.5/10, DNF'd the sequel. Appreciated the uncommon setting of a trailer park, the sense of poverty-related hopelessness, family dysfunction, and grittier tone. Sequel was too melodramatic for my tastes. It isn't perfect, but it was different, and that's the essence of variety.
5. {The Age of Arrogance}: This isn't a novel, it's a manhwa featuring a muscleheaded, but smart woman that technically heads an entire country. She's very pretty and has killed a lot of guys with her bare hands. My dream woman

r6w2rk,Here is every book I've read from this subreddit in the last 14 weeks and how I would rank them,"I joined this subreddit 3 months ago looking for a good book to read, and safe to say I found a few. Looking back on my kindle library, I've read 50 books since joining and I desperately need more. I still work from home so I have a lot of free time, and finding all of these recommendations has been great for me. 

I'm going on a cruise for a week here soon, and I need several recommendations that I can download while I still have internet before I get on the ship. What better way to get good recommendations than to tell you what stories I've already read? So, here goes nothing. I'll try to keep it short unless I have a lot to say about any of the books. If you happen to disagree with any of my thoughts, I'd love to hear them too! Of course these are just my opinions, so nothing personal if I didn't like a book you did!

SPOILERS AHEAD!

&#x200B;

* **The Simple Wild** trilogy by KA Tucker. *10 out of 10.* What a great start this was! These books are actually still my favorite out of every other thing I've read lately. I loved every minute of Jonah and Calla's story. Can't wait for book four.
* **All Rhodes Lead Here** by Mariana Zapata**-** *7 out of 10.* I liked it, but definitely didn't love it. The pet names drove me nuts, and Aurora was too immature and naïve for someone her age. I really liked the nontraditional family dynamic with Rhodes and Am, though. Great setting, too. 
* **The Gamble** by Kristen Ashley- *1 out of 10.* DNF @ 60%. I couldn't stand the main characters, the writing style, the dialogue, basically everything! I won't read another book by Kristen Ashley if I can help it. This book was not it. I'm surprised I was able to read more than half of this book. 
* **After We Fall** by Melanie Harlow- *4 out of 10.*
* **It Happened One Summer** by Tessa Bailey- *5 out of 10.* 
* **Fix Her Up** by Tessa Bailey- 2 *out of 10.* Holy shit I hated this book! Out of the ones I finished, this was my least favorite. Georgie was great. She is why I had to complete this book. Travis, however, is the worst MMC I've ever seen. Seriously. I know possessiveness can be attractive to some people, and I can handle a certain amount, but this guy was so toxic to Georgie. Georgie is constantly talking about how she wants to be treated like an adult and taken seriously, yet Travis is constantly belittling her and treating her like a helpless child. I hated reading his chapters because all he ever thinks about is sex. I get this is a romance book and all, but come on Travis, you're a grown ass man. Control yourself. His proposal at the end made me cringe so hard I had to put the book down and pick it up later. Fuck Travis Ford. 
* **Hothead** by Stella Rhys- *8/10.* This book is what Fix Her Up could have been. It has fake dating and the MMC is a baseball player. Drew and Evie were so much better together than Georgie and Travis. I loved it, honestly. It was fantastic.
* **I Owe You One** by Sophie Kinsella- *5/10.*
* **Tinfoil Heart** by Daisy Prescott- *6/10*
* **Happy Trail** by Daisy Prescott- *9/10.* Fucking loved it. Can you tell I like books that take place in rural locations/surrounded by nature?
* **How to Walk Away** by Katherine Center- *9/10.* This book made me go read a bunch of other Katherine Center books. I adored everything about this book. 10 out of 10.
* **Things You Save in a Fire** by Katherine Center- *6/10.* It was still good, but I would have liked to see the MC's interact a little more. I didn't believe they were actually in love at the end. 
* **Happiness for Beginners** by Katherine Center- *10/10.* Obsessed with this book. I've read it twice now. No complaints whatsoever. 
* **Breathe the Sky** by Michelle Hazen- DNF at 15% and for the life of me, I cannot remember why. I might have to go back and try this one again.
* **The Tourist Attraction** series- *9/10.* Loved. I'm slowly finding out that if you write a book that takes place in Alaska, I'll probably like it! Read every book that's been released. 
* **Happy Singles Day** by Ann Marie Walker- *6/10*
* **The Player Next Door** by KA Tucker- *9/10* I liked this book a LOT more than I thought I would. Because of this I read more books by KA Tucker. She's a wonderful author.
* **Twice Shy** by Sarah Hodge- *7/10*
* **The Unhoneymooners** by Christina Lauren- *9/10*
* **Above and Beyond** by Kathryn Shay- *5/10*
* **The Spanish Love Deception** by Elena Armas- *10/10.* 
* **The Cheat Sheet** by Sarah Adams- DNF at 25%. I might have to go back and try this one again. It couldn't hold my interest the first time.
* **Second First Impressions** by Sally Thorne-*4/10.* 
* **The Off-Limits Rule** by Sarah Adams- *8/10.* I went into this with low expectations since I couldn't finish the last Sarah Adams book I read, but I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this book. Cooper is fantastic! I loved reading his chapters. 
* **Until It Fades** by KA Tucker- *9/10.* I've loved every KA Tucker book I've read so far, and this one is no exception. Brett is the sweetest!
* **Say You Still Love Me** by KA Tucker- *10/10.* I would love to meet KA Tucker and tell her about how much I loved this story. Every minute of it was so enjoyable. 
* **Beach Read** by Emily Henry-*9/10.*
* **People We Meet on Vacation** by Emily Henry- *8/10.* Everything about Emily Henry's writing style is so refreshing and real to me. She truly is a great author, and her characters are very relatable and raw. I would read anything she publishes.
* **Loving the Ladies' Man** by Kristin Canary- *6/10.*
* **The Roommate Situation** by Katie Bailey- *4/10.* 
* **That Fine Line** by Cindy Steel-*3/10.*
* **The Hating Game** by Sally Thorne- *4/10.* I know, right? This books seems right up my alley, but I don't know...I didn't like Josh? Was I supposed to like Josh? 
* **Josh and Hazel's Guide to Not Dating** by Christina Lauren- *10/10.* I LOVED this Josh. 
* **I Hated You First** by Rachel John-*3/10.* 
* **So Not My Thing** by Melanie Jacobson- DNF @ 40%. 
* **Wild Open Hearts** by Kathryn Nolan- *7/10.* Does the author understand how much a billion dollars is? I don't think she does. This book doesn't give me the impression that she does. 
* **Kulti** by Mariana Zapata- DNF @ 46%.
* **The Love Hypothesis** by Ali Hazelwood- *8/10.* Really enjoyed this one, actually. Great banter between the two MC's.
* **Rock Bottom Girl** by Lucy Score-*9/10.* This book was VERY GOOD! Had no expectations going in and was very satisfied. Couldn't put this one down. 
* **The Love Act** by Zara Bell- *8/10.* I guess I really like celebrity fake relationship books? Who woulda thought? 
* **Can You Keep a Secret** by Sophie Kinsella- *6/10.* Better than the movie. 
* **Blue-Eyed Devil** and **Smooth Talking Stranger** by Lisa Kleypas- *5/10* and *6/10.*  Jack and Ella's story was better than Haven and Hardy's, but in general these books are way more misogynistic than they need to be.  I get it takes place in Texas or whatever (that's how the story explains their possessiveness and overall uncomfortable demeanor), but Jack and Hardy need to calm the hell down. 
* **To Love Jason Thorne** by Ella Maise-*8/10.*
* **To Hate Adam Connor** by Ella Maise-*6/10.* Jason and Olive had a better story. Adam is great, though. 
* **Alaskan Wild** by Helena Newbury- What I'm currently reading! About halfway through it. 
* One quick (not) honorable mention- In the past I've read Sarah J. Maas, which I've seen mentioned on here a lot. I have read most of Throne of Glass and ACOTAR series. SJM is probably my least favorite author, if I had to pick one. I find her books to be very white-washed, problematic, confusing, and oftentimes blatantly plagiarized. I'm genuinely sorry if you really do enjoy her books, they just aren't for me.

uga9a3,"Book recs in the vein of Evie Dunmore, Elizabeth Kingston or Denise Williams in contemporary romance? (+ some review babbling of my April reads)","First time poster here and recently hooked on romance literature, I've read around 30 romance books over the past two months, some of them recommended in this sub (thank you!). I've looked around on Goodreads, Amazon recs and searching the sub but I figured I'll write a post like a human being and ask for 'like-minded' recs. 

Here's a recap of my April reads and what I liked in particular and looking for more of:

1. **The League of Extraordinary Women series by Evie Dunmore** (all 3 of them) = I really love this series, particularly the political and historical feminist aspect. In **""A rogue of one's own"" and ""Portrait of a Scotsman""**: I loved the personality contrast in the pairings and Scotland / Scots always get extra points in my book. If I had to rank my favorite type of men, both male leads are in my top 5 even though they're very different. I think the author has a great way of portraying both women and men in both books, especially how these women navigate a deeply unequal society and advocate for those who don't have a voice while advocating for themselves as individuals, and how men become unexpected allies. Also 🔥🔥🔥 
2. **Elizabeth Kingston's ""The King's Man"" and ""Fair, Bright and Terrible""** = these 2 are actually recs I found on the sub (thank you!) and I was surprisingly pleased with both books. At first I thought the medieval setting would not be my thing, but the particular historical and political themes actually made me love the series, especially the story of the conquest of Wales, which I did not know anything about. ""The King's Man"" was my favorite romance-wise; I loved the Fantaghiro / Mulan character, especially because it wasn't caricatural >!(as in the female character was portrayed as not very feminine, not attractive, not charismatic in an obvious way and still a strong leader, a woman who torn between two conditions and how to maintain her agency without betraying a greater cause)!<. 
3. After a long detour in Regency romance in March, I started reading more **contemporary** stuff as well in April. Some of them I didn't like (""Fool me once"" by Ashley Winstead or ""The Heart Principle""), but I found one standout: **""The fastest way to fall"" by Denise Williams**. I have another standout, but it's **a Regency one ""Never Fall For Your Fiancée"" by Virginia Heath**. What I most enjoyed about these two is the Bridget Jones with less baggage / ""level up"" vibe in ""TFWTF"" and the fact that the lead male character was a working class self made man (a bit like the guy from ""Portrait of a Scotsman""). As for ""NFFYF"", it just made me laugh out loud throughout (yay escapism)! 
4. S**ome books I didn't like or didn't connect with:** Helen Hoang's ""Kiss Quotient"" and ""The heart principle"". The latter was just too heavy and I didn't like the female lead because she was too passive and wishy washy (although I loved Quan because tattoos + vulnerability = magic). I didn't like the female leads in ""Fool me once"" or ""Act your age Eve Brown"" (Talia Hibbert) and ""Get a life Chloe Brown"": the first one was just a horrible selfish person IMO, the second one was too entitled and childish and the other Brown sister was entitled and obnoxious (although I was in love with Red throughout the book - because tattoos + vulnerability + working class Brit humor and attitude = kryptonite). 
5. **Honorable mentions:** ""Bringing down the duke"" by Evie Dunmore (cool but both leads were a bit bland compared to the rest of the series), ""Twice Shy"" by Sarah Hogle (tbh I found the male character really strangely written personality wise and I was more into the fixer-upper stuff lol), ""How to fail at flirting"" by Denise Williams (great love at first sight premise but I don't know why the male lead gave me borderline narcissistic / abusive vibes). 
6. **Currently on my list to read:** I have **""The bride test""** by Hoang (mostly because I'm a completionist and I'm intrigued by the main female character as someone who's trying to find a better life) and **""Desire Lines""** which is the third book of Kingston's Welsh Blades series. There's a lot of books I'm waiting on that aren't released yet (notably from **Ali Hazelwood - I loved ""The Love Hypothesis""** as it was the perfect mix of academia, nerds in STEM, serious issues mixed with 🔥) but other than that, I don't know what to read next... 

Any good books to share based on all that ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/uga9a3/book_recs_in_the_vein_of_evie_dunmore_elizabeth/,2022-05-01T21:46:56Z,7,7,RomanceBooks,The Love Hyopthesis,POST
13us97u,I read and rated every(ish) book in the BookTok section of Target so that you don't have to!,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xpo5r1ldnp2b1.jpg?width=678&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9aa625d987512c70fd283bda0df02d8674a6ad71

Just kidding, of course you want to read all the romance novels! But if you're wondering which might be better suited to your tastes, I ranked them! I also noted if they were romance or not, since a couple don’t quite fit the genre.

Some notes:

&#x200B;

* Let's begin with the elephant in the room - almost 20% of the books are by Colleen Hoover. This begs many questions. Does Target think Colleen Hoover books are so popular that they will fly off the shelf, leaving them with empty shelves? Did Ms. Hoover's people strike a deal with Target (or Satan) to guarantee such a spot? I'm sure we could all pick 7 books we are surprised didn't make the cut (Do Emily Henry and Target have beef?), yet there are 2 entire shelves of Hoover. At any rate, I started with the Hoover section with **It Ends With Us**. I don't read back covers because I hate spoilers, but I saw that this was tagged as romance and dug in. Fuck, man. I read it all in a day. I cried the whole time. I didn't sleep for more than single hour periods for 3 days after that. I read one paragraph, not even one of the more haunting ones, to my husband and he started crying. I have to acknowledge that this book kept me reading, left a huge impact on me, made me think, and was genuinely well-written. With that in mind, fuck you, Colleen, no one makes me feel my feelings and gets away with it! I did not read any more of her books. The trust is gone.
* After the Hoover snafu, I learned to skim Amazon reviews. The word that came up over and over again for **Little Life** was ""tragic."" I just do not have space for that after what Ms. Hoover did to me. Maybe some other time.
* Unfortunately, I don't do graphic novels. **Heartstoppers** hit the chopping block. I tried very briefly, but I couldn't get through the first section. It looks adorable and I hear the story is charming. It did inspire me to watch the Netflix series.
* The above photo was taken AFTER I started this challenge, so some of the books are different. The one I used for reference had many of the books missing, so it isn’t as cute.

Ok, now for the spoiler-free countdown! Ranked from least to most favorite, starting with....

17. **Neon Gods** \- I don't know how ACOTAR only gets 2 of its books on this shelf, but yet we are treated to the entire Neon Gods series. I love smut, I love Hades and Persephone, this should have been a no brainer. Unfortunately, I made it about 75% through this book and didn't see any magic. This could have been fine, plenty of mythology based stories manage to still be interesting without the powers; however, for me, I didn't find anything that compelled me to read further.

**Is it romance?** Probably, I didn't see if there was a HEA. **Do I recommend it?** If you like BDSM and the mafia. People who aren’t me seem to really vibe with this one, so I’m an odd duck I guess.

16. **Gleanings** \- I tried reading Scythe years ago. It was the book that made me realize that I pretty much only want romance novels in my life. It was an interesting concept, but left me dry. I don't have the patience in me to read the entire Scythe series in order to get to this one. So, I technically didn’t read it, but I feel like it probably is similar to the first of the series.

**Is it romance?** No. Someone go back in time and make me check first. **Do I recommend it?** Please comment your opinion if you've read more than the first book!

15. **The Cheat Sheet** \- A cute read. Friends to romance, fake dating. I didn't think the author really did anything terribly interesting with the trope that I haven't seen before, but it made for a relaxing afternoon to read. I wish there had been more actual conflict in getting to the HEA, but that's my taste. I liked the relationship between the football players. It was the only book not on my Libby or on Kindle Unlimited, so maybe consider that.

**Is it romance?** Yes, ma'am. **Do I recommend it?** If you want a light, easy read.

14. **The Unhoneymooners** \- I don't think there was anything that was particularly memorable about this one. The characters were fine, the plot was fine. I was annoyed with how co-dependent the FMC and her sister were, but other than that, nothing really stood out.

**Is it romance?** Yep. **Do I recommend it?** If you have a complicated sister relationship, I guess.

13. **The Silent Patient** \- Not even a touch romantic, so it never stood much of a chance. I did enjoy the twist at the end and didn't see it coming at all. I have a hard time loving a book if I don't love the main character, so this one was tough for me. It was fairly enjoyable.

**Is it romance?** Almost certainly not. **Do I recommend it?** If you like mysteries I would give it a try.

12. **The Good Girl Complex** \- This is another neutral book to me. I think it advertises itself clearly as a good girl/bad boy book, and I suppose I'm not really into that kind of thing. I did like the dog.

**Is it romance?** Yes. **Do I recommend it?** If it's available on Libby or KU.

11. **I Just Haven't Met You Yet -** I liked a lot of the themes of this book, but the characters didn't resonate with me. The descriptions of the area were lovely. I think this one was more on the comedy side of the romantic comedy, so maybe it's for a different audience. I do really like British humor, so I'm surprised I didn't like this more.

**Is it romance?** Yeah. **Do I recommend it?** If you want British comedy with a side of romance.

10. **Funny You Should Ask** \- Spoiler tags bc I have a lot of feelings. I enjoyed reading this book, I just wanted it to give me... more. ~~The main character is a writer, which I feel like is a difficult concept to pull off since it's obviously a very common FMC profession. The idea that the FMC cared about her reputation as a writer as a consequence of her romantic actions was a concept I haven't read about before, but I'm not really sure I cared about it. I think the book got its title from the fact that, as a journalist, the FMC has to ask a lot of questions. It felt a little gimmicky to me. I just feel like there were so many elements to this story that really could have gone places, but didn't. It was also a bit redundant. The structure of the book made it so the content was a little redundant and robbed it of some much needed suspense.~~ The author clearly has a unique voice and I hope to read something else by her that is more up my alley.

**Is it romance?** Sure. **Do I recommend it?** If it's available on Libby right now, sure.

9. **The Atlas Six** \- The reason the challenge took so long! The audiobook and ebook were on hold at Libby for months and months. I tried to listen on audiobook, but the vocabulary was quite sophisticated. The ebook was much more my speed. The beginning of the book was particularly suspenseful and intriguing. I loved how deeply the author explored every single character and how their powers informed them. She kept me guessing. The only reason this isn't higher is because it was a little more about magical theories and thought experiments than I care for. Call me old fashioned, but I like my magic to be a bit more razzle dazzle and a bit less philosophical.

**Is it romance?** No. There's more romance than Scythe for sure, but it's tangential to the plot. **Do I recommend it?** If you love fantasy, go for it. If you don't, this wouldn't be the fantasy book I'd start with.

8. **The Deal -** When I first read this book, I thought to myself that it was a pretty run of the mill romance. I can tell you months later that I'm still thinking about how much I liked the MMC. So charming. I think there were so many layers to the themes and characters, and I enjoyed it. It felt believable and cozy. I read much of the rest of the series while I waited for the Atlas Six!

**Is it romance?** Totes. **Do I recommend it?** So lovely, of course I recommend it.

7. **Hook, Line, and Sinker** \- Holy shit, I loved this book. I've been noticing that others prefer the previous novel in the series, but I'm all about this one. I found the characters more relatable and the realities of meeting estranged family members more realistic. I loved that it used the first novel of the series to set up a slow burn for this couple, but condensed much of the burning quickly so that I didn't have to be in agony. The MMC was exactly my brand of steamy. The friends to lovers dynamic was satisfying. The barriers that kept the two apart were believable. The pacing was excellent. The minor characters were delightful and vivid. Chef’s kiss.

**Is it romance?** Most definitely. **Do I recommend it?** Hard.

6. **The Love Hypothesis** \- Pure candy. I have read this book so many times I cannot count. This is the book you read if you want a bunch of nonsense shenanigans, to grin from ear to ear, and to fall a little head over heels over an unrealistically dreamy MMC. No way was this guy single before the FMC came along. I bought the audiobook for when I have bad days.

**Is it romance?** At its very core. **Do I recommend it?** Only to those who are here for a good time. If you're opposed to silliness or tropes, not for you.

5. **Daisy Jones and the Six** \- I listened to this on audiobook, and I recommend doing the same. This book captivated me. I loved the storyline. The characters sounded and acted so realistically, like people I went to with high school who were cooler than me. Such an interesting concept that I've never seen before. I don't think this one qualifies as a romance, but there were plenty of romantic elements. So many times, I just thought to myself, ""this is brilliant."" I guess they're making (made?) a show on Amazon, so there's that, too!

**Is it romance?** Not technically, but there are romantic elements throughout. **Do I recommend it?** If you are looking for something quite different, have any interest in music or rock star life, or appreciate good story telling, yes! If you are adamant that you want a traditional novel, I still recommend you try it, honestly.

4. **The Spanish Love Deception** \- Travel! Silly cousins! Enemies to lovers! Ladies and gentleman, THIS is how fake dating is done! There was so much texture to the writing, so many interesting plot lines, so many times that I thought ""oh, this is going to be the central plot struggle,"" but it was only just beginning! What phenomenal depth of characters, what a great balance of silly and sincere. See me alone in my living room, doing a standing ovation/slow clap combo.

**Is it romance?** To quote the Kool-Aid man, ""Oh, yeah!"" **Do I recommend it?** If you're looking for a fun book, do it!

3. **Red, White, and Royal Blue** \- Casey McQuisto could write a description of me tying my shoes, and it would be beautiful. I'm in love with the MMCs. I loved how much time he took just giving the characters space to grow and fall in love. The plot was great, sure, but that's not what made this book sing. The story is vivid, inspiring, and heartfelt. I cannot wait for the movie.**Is it romance?** Absolutely. **Do I recommend it?** Most ardently.

2. **The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo** \- Oh man, this book. I encourage you to go into it without any spoilers if you can. I laughed, I cried, I raved to all of my book friends. I could wax rhapsodic about this one for ages, but the joy of the book is the journey and the big reveals along the way. I will just say that it touched me in a way that was very personal and directly led to some positive changes in my life that I don't think would have happened had I not picked up this book. This is the best book I have read in years.

**Is it romance?** Not technically, but there was enough romance to keep me hooked anyway. **Do I recommend it?** Stop reading this and go read that.

1. **A Court of Thorns and Roses** \- SJM has ruined books for me. I'm here, day after day, just trying to recreate the high I got when reading this series.

**Is it romance?** You bet your ass. **Do I recommend it?** If you’re reading this, you’re probably already on all of the SJM fan pages. Should I get the Graphic Audio if I already have the regular audio?

smf6fp,Books where the male lead falls for the female lead first and everyone thinks he is a mean person but he is actually the opposite?,"Are there any books where:

-The hero falls in love first but isn't annoying or creepy

-The heroine isn't mean but rather sweet and has a bubbly personality which the male lead loves

-The ML is seen as a cold-hearted person, who gives 0 shit about others but when the FL spends time with him, she gets to know his true self

-The love story is evolving slowly but with no irritating/unnesessary drama

-There are lots of cute and romantic scenes between the FL and ML

-The feelings and the facial expressions are written in detail and beautifully

-Both tease eachother in a very sweet way

-The heroine and hero have past trauma
(to spice the story up)

-They care for eachother and respect the decisions of eachother

-They aren't afraid to show their affection towards eachother

-The story isn't boring so that I don't skip some pages

13v142g,DNF'd Twilight. Ummm???,"Yeah I know I'm crazy late. 

Okay so there was a post here a while ago about popular books you haven't read and people were saying I should give some of the books a try. So I started with Twilight.

I was almost done, just couldn't finish.

Now, I had already seen the movies but I was told throughout all that time that there was way more context in the book.

Now I really don't mean to insult anyone here who enjoyed these books, I seriously don't. 

But there was really no missing context about having Jacob imprint on a child. ""They don't *have* to be romantic"" but it's implied that they could be in the future..that if Renesmee wanted it, Jacob would go along

Like yeah I know it's fantasy but...you wrote it?? There's no other way you could've given Jacob a happy ending? It's just such a weird choice. This man was literally after her mother the whole time just to potentially be with her daughter??? 

Maybe I'm overreacting idk. I just don't think kids should be used in romance this way. Why was this the author's go-to to give Jacob a happy ending? 

I just needed to vent this somewhere because obvi everyone's alrdy read the books. Again, don't mean to offend anyone.

15cm17p,I have never read Twilight before,"Ok listen, it's not like I intentionally avoided it because I thought they were trash, but born and raised in an Asian country the hype wasn't as big as like in the states and though there were some fans no one really talked about them *that much.* 

Also because I was raised by Asian parents who are both academics, I felt hesitant to read them at home (I thought I'd be judged). I read a lot of romances now, and I know that twilight was a gateway for a lot of people, so I feel like I missed out that whole ya romance/fantasy era because I was busy picking up classics and boring nonfiction to please my parents and not be true to myself or the things *I* wanted to read.

Do you think it would be worth reading Twilight now if I haven't read them or watched the movies? 

If you don't think it'll be that good of a read now, do you have any books that you consider to be the 'upgraded' version of Twilight?

I gave the sub a search and haven’t come up with anything that fits my specific itch. First, yes I know the title lol but but in my defense! I started rereading twilight for shits and giggles and was caught up with the whole vibe for the wolf pack (I was a team Edward girl so I *vehemently* opposed anything wolf related, oh’ sweet summer child if you could see your reading habits now.) 

Basically my itch is something werewolf, family oriented a little or with the mentions of a positive (ish) pack and some soulmate I would die for you type of dramatic nonsense. 

I’m not looking for specifically a Jacob vibe more just werewolf lol I am definitely not into anything dark, noncon, or I’m the alpha/bully.  

I have read the werewolf book by Juliette Cross and Heather Guerre - both good but neither scratches the itch! (Highly recommend tho!)

gde11m,Stephanie Meyer will release Midnight Sun in August. Twilight from the POV of Edward. Opinions?,"There has been a lot of speculation about the countdown on her website and it has been revealed today that the book will be Twilight from Edward's POV.

Also, it would be nice if they guy wasn't ""perfect"". Usually, in the few times where a romance book is written from a guy's perspective, it's just a POV swap of a normal romance premise and the guy is still incredibly good looking/super intelligent/rich and successful, etc. Just a normal guy would be nice. 

Basically, I'm a guy that also likes vampire books. I'm usually have to read books with a FMC, which is fine, but I would relate more to a male POV with a normal, down to earth guy that has to deal with romance and/love triangles that normally a woman would have to deal with in the vast majority of romance novels.

11m6k3a,"Books like ""Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined"" - story featuring magical/talented gal and regular guy","I enjoyed reading ""Life and Death"" , even more than I did reading ""Twilight"" years ago. I don't normally enjoy gender swap books/stories, I find them kind of boring and unimaginative, but for whatever reason ""Life and Death"" was unexpectedly different. At least from my perspective.

Anyway, I'm looking for similar books. I prefer fantasy, especially ""low fantasy"", and a male main character, but I can be flexible.   
Anything with a magical/talented/gifted heroine and a ""regular guy"" hero would be great. I'm not looking for the guy to take the role of ""damsel in distress"" or to be a slacker or anything, but I find it interesting to see how the guy ""keeps up"" and tries to adapt in a relationship where the traditional roles and dynamics have been drastically changed. Kind of like Sokka and Suki...especially if Suki were a Bender (if there are any ""Avatar"" fans here to get that reference).  


Last thing: bonus points if the guy has at least a little bit of emotional intelligence and empathy. 

For example: It seems like most romance plots tend to involve a ""love triangle"" or something similar. It's frustrating to read about a guy who has multiple women interested in him and he doesn't do the bare minimum to show respect for their feelings. Particularly when he decides to pursue one of those women and doesn't acknowledge the other women's feelings or even try to end things (romantically) in a respectful way with them.   
Maybe I'm being too specific or demanding with this last request, though.

I've been trying to find this supernatural romance novel I read in high school. From the age of the stock of books that would have been in the library I got it from it was most likely published in 80s to late 90s.

The plot starts with the fmc husband/boyfriend being mauled to death while they were at the beach and police not believing her that it was something supernatural. I think the main plot was a decaying creepy classroom at the school the heroine taught at.

ht69gj,Hot and Bothered: Twilight in Quarantine (podcast recommendation),"So Midnight Sun is coming out soon, and I know a lot of us on here are planning on reading it for one reason or another. 

I have come to help you in case you don't want to do a whole reread of the Twilight series first, or want a good podcast to listen to while you relive the glory days of being 16 and discovering romance and vampires for the first time (or was that just me?):

[Hot and Bothered: Twilight in Quarantine](https://www.hotandbotheredrompod.com/twilight-in-quarantine) is a hilarious and sometimes biting podcast rereading the Twilight series chapter by chapter. There are two friends who read the chapter and come together for 20ish minute episodes to give advice for both the author and the characters in the books. They end the episode with planning a care package for Bella (and sometimes other characters) to help them make better decisions. (Example of a care package from one episode: calling the dentist for Charlie, getting Bella a medicine cabinet because apparently she takes her toiletries to and from the bathroom like she's in a dorm, and a dishrack lol)

I've been listening to it on my walks and during my chores. The ladies behind Hot and Bothered are smart and feminist, but still try hard not to denigrate the books too hard and appreciate romance in general. I'd give it a good 4 stars if it was a book, because I don't really know how to review podcasts.

reyqjg,Twilight Pineapples: I'm looking for book suggestions w/ self-aware unhealthy romances,"So I'm looking for books with a specific thing to possibly read to do reviews of.

Please give book recommendations that have what would be considered unhealthy romances in real life, but the author is aware of that and either has significant in-book consequences for the unhealthy behaviors (example: romantic interest transgressing boundaries doesn't get the girl/person in the end as a direct result, or is similarly punished) or has an author note at the end saying ""hey, this is all fun and games for fiction, but if someone actually stalks you or does something bad, gets out of there. Also practice safe, sane, and consensual things"". It's a sort of literary device I'm naming the ""Twilight Pineapple"" since it doesn't have a name that I'm aware of - Twilight referring to the book everyone knows of course, lol, which ironically doesn't have any of this, and pineapple referring to a kinda comical safe word that sometimes gets used in the kink community.

Basically, I want romance books that are aware they're a fantasy and don't advocate for their unhealthy aspects as desirable and make that clear somehow, if this makes sense?

1b0bgrp,The Twilight series is poorly written but  I have to defend this plot point,"The writing is mostly garbage(I still like some of the world building) and problematic. I haven’t read the series in full since high school. This isn’t even in defense of twilight but it makes complete sense that the Edward and his “siblings” were high school. It is one of the few logical points in the story that are clearly explained in both the books and films. The Cullens “kids” are not perpetually in high school. In fact, they rarely do high school at all. However, when they settle into a small town(where they are much more conspicuous than a major city), they must use a back story that will allow them to stay in the town for as long as possible without people noticing they aren’t aging. This is done by beginning in their new home as high school sophomores(Edward and Alice) and juniors(Jasper, Emmet, and Rosalie). They graduate, go to college, & go to graduate school. By the time they reach their mid to late 20s without aging, the towns people start to take notice and they leave. If they start at an older age, the fact they look like teenagers will be noticed in a shorter period time(this issue is unclear in the movies because they all look 30).

They had lived in Forks 70 or so years before, liked it, and wanted their second stay to last a long time. They had just moved there the year before Bella so still in the early phase of a planned 10-15 year stay in Forks. That’s why they were still in high school. 

No idea what kind of new batshit backstories they’d have to make for themselves after adding Bella and the demon baby to their number.


Side note, so many problematic aspects about Twilight are discussed but is no one disturbed Stephanie Meyer’s dream man(the book was literally born out a dream she had of him) is a 17 year old boy?

wl2j6u,[No Spoilers} Thoughts on Twilight From a 33 Year-Old Man Reading it for the First Time.,"I wrote a post on The Shining a little bit ago that got some fun feedback and discussion, so I decided on mentioning something I've since read that is a little less intense.

A few years ago, I was on my main Reddit account, typing out feedback for a Redditor's short story submission, when I saw a comment underneath the original post that sent me back in time:

""Still a better love story than Twilight!"" from a reader.

Followed by an extremely amused:

""LOL!!!! THANKS!!"" from the author.

I completely missed the bus on Twilight. I was never part of the target audience of the books, but I always remembered thinking that the backlash against a monster romance aimed at young girls was way too harsh at a time where some real stinker movies were being held up as modern classics. In recent years, I've decided to kind of go back and catch up on some of the most popular literature I missed while growing up, including Harry Potter, Ice and Fire, and others, regardless of any demographic gap.

If I could put my feelings about reading Twilight into one sentence: I didn't like the story, but I have some affection for the book.

My biggest surprise with Twilight was in regards to its length. I was expecting to read a pulpy 300 page romance fantasy aimed at the sensibilities of a teenage girl. Basically, I was expecting Anne Rice-inspired gothic horror for the Myspace generation.

The first Twilight book has *119,000 words*, and boy does it ever read like it. Every time Bella decides that it's time to start providing commentary, the story itself goes into bullet time as she describes every feature of the room, every miniscule detail of her school schedule, and every minor movement of every character, complete with glib observations of glib observations. It is *laboriously* paced. It's genuinely shocking how verbose this book is.

But I can't really pretend that I think this book should be derided as being the worst thing I've ever read, mainly because I have read this story a thousand times on creative writing subs and forums, including my own works. It has all the hallmarks of an American Gen X or Millenial writer who was told by their public school teachers to do things like use the words 'explained' or 'exclaimed' instead of 'said.' While reading the character action sentences, I was reminded of every time a reader gave the awful feedback that Bella can't just get in the car and drive away- we must be told that she picked up her keys, opened the garage door, opened the car door, sat down, put the keys in the ignition... I could go on, but I won't.

I didn't feel the hate that so many people 18 years ago seemed to feel, because I was actually starting to empathize with the author, even moreso than any of the characters. Twilight is every first draft that every amateur author has written, but it just so happened that Mrs. Meyer's first book got absurdly popular after receiving maybe a cursory editing pass. I actually find reading about Stephenie Meyer to be more interesting than the book. I try to wonder what the reaction to one of my early writing projects would have been had one of them gotten popular for some reason, and I find the image both hilarious and terrifying.

I know this isn't a traditional review, but who honestly cares what anyone's Goodread score for the first Twilight book is at this point?

&#x200B;

EDIT: People have mentioned it, but of course there are issues with the book's quality and some of the problematic aspects of the Bella/Edward relationship. I originally had more of an in-depth review-style post that talked about the finer details of the books, but I cut a lot of it because I mostly just wanted to touch on some personal feelings that came to me while reading it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wl2j6u/no_spoilers_thoughts_on_twilight_from_a_33/,2022-08-10T16:55:49Z,701,4808,books,Twilight,POST
16xpuot,The Twilight Saga unironically gave me hope for my future as a deeply closeted queer kid,"If it's going to bother you that I'm going to express a semi-ironic but also deeply earnest fondness for the Spoorkle Vempir book, trigger warning I guess. Everyone knows it's self-indulgent trash, 'ight? We've had like, 15 years of that. Everyone knows Mormons exist. Everyone knows everything teenage girls and stay at home mothers like is the fifth horseman of the apocalypse. We can move past that.

*I'm an ftm transgender man, I came out as a (at the time) lesbian when I was 16, and started transitioning just two years ago. I read the books when I was around eleven or twelve, living in a very oppressive environment both in the local culture and at home.*

Little kid me was hard-core *obsessed* with these books. Something adult me has been left thinking very introspectively about since . . . I kind of strongly dislike romance. I think I've finally figured out why. 

I must now jumpscare you with the revelation I was a bit of a loser loner growing up--- I know, what a surprise, hope you had your smelling salts at hand. So cards on the table, I literally completely and utterly missed the extremely obvious subtext that there was supposed to be a love triangle *at all* in the series until the movies started coming out and I got the chance to talk to other Twilight fans. Read all four books, literally never occurred to me once Jacob was anything other than another obstacle for Edward and Bella. That's because, as an adult, I can see now that I was reading something entirely different out of subtext of these books. That these novels are designed as indulgent fantasy scenarios where anyone can project themselves into them is lobbed at them like an insult, like that's an inherently bad thing, but screw that unironically these novels were the first and closest things I had as a child to there being even a fraction of a chance I could be happy and okay one day as a queer person. 

I realize this was entirely likely not at all Meyer's intention for these books to be read this way, but that doesn't really matter.

 ""Bella I'm a horrible terrible disgusting creature of the night, I'll make you a social pariah if you love me, I'm a forever alone."" 

""No Edward you're beautiful I love you and I love all of you and will be absurdly devoted to loving you even if it makes me a creature of the night to do so."" 

It me. I'm Edward. Or rather, I related to Edward feeling like by loving someone he was going to destroy them even though my man did just love Bella, for very just genuine reasons in the text of the novels. I was a few years away from discovering Ann Rice, alright? I was a child who had from a very young age been smacked over the head repeatedly that the type of affection that was natural to me was vile and disgusting and less i express it I'm putting both myself and the girl I have a crush on in danger. One of the shitty parts of growing up queer is that long before you're actually willing to admit it to yourself, other children notice. Even without the words to verbalize it, when I was seven years old there was a girl in my class that, all I knew was that she was the coolest, prettiest, most perfect person I had ever known and all I wanted was to very innocently be around her all the time and have her tell me what a good ""friend"" I was and maybe even possibly get to hold her hand if it wasn't too much to ask. I got bullied literally for fucking years over just that. Out of a kindness in her beyond her years she never did anything to me to explicitly estrange herself from me, despite her other friends giving her shit for it. I never got to be close to her, and I don't blame her for that. 

That Bella is so fucking absurdly willing to make her relationship with Edward work despite his vampireness making everything extremely complicated was earth shattering. That she thinks his vampirism is actually pretty cool despite what society says was literally life changing. You can say whatever about the relationship being toxic blah blah blah, yes reading the books now as an adult there's tons of elements that bother me too, but again, it's okay to give the material some slack for that reason alone.

I think sometimes when people insist certain pieces of media give little girls ""bad messages,"" they're willfully or unconsciously not actually considering how that age and demographic interpretes a text. Like, ""Disney princess falls for first male she sees, Ariel give up voice for man, Belle stockholmed, Snow white kissed by man she don't know."" *Are valid things to point out and consider* but often are given way, WAY too much weight compared to how a child is viewing that piece of media. Tween girls don't have the life experience or political framework to draw that from the text by themselves, it takes additional pieces of indoctrination that are more explicit for them to actually internalize that. Pare-bonding, fated mates, soul mates, twin flames, overly possessive relationships with poor boundaries or proper foundational work or any other kind of romantic attraction without any ambiguity is something I find deeply disturbing to be confronted with in media now. I'm now old enough to know just how much that cultural mindset set me up to get deeply hurt by the time I was an adult. Disney movies, teen romance, Twilight and the whole genre of supernatural fiction it spawned didn't teach me that though. Society did. My parents did. At worst none of those pieces of media challenged that concept, and at best, that media met me where I was at. 

The thing about Twilight that genuinely is subversive though is that it categorically, vehemently insists every ""drawback"" of engaging romantically with vampires is stupid and wrong. Twilight says Vampire rights, love is love. Vampirism is a valid choice that doesn't actually exclude you living a normal happy life, even though they've been forced to act in certain problematic ways ways as a group marginalized by society. A group of vampire facists have literally taken advantage of this to their own benifit to victimize their own kind for personal gain *cough* republicanswhogetcaughtwithgayescorts *cough*. They literally *sparkle in the sun* and human propaganda has turned that into them *burning because they are against God and nature oh why does that sound oddly farmiliar.* Again, I realize Twilight likely wasn't intended to be any kind of queer allegory, but vampires kind of accidentally end up almost seeming like one even if that wasn't the intent because of the cultural mythos built around them. In that context, there are elements to Twilight that are more progressive than Ann Rice's vampires as queer allegories.

pq95gy,Why Twilight was/is so popular..,"I used to love, love, love Twilight, the books and the movies but not anymore. I have read a lot more books, watched more shows and anime and for the longest time it was absurd to me why Twilight was so popular and why I liked it so much, but now I have come up with this theory ( please bear with me)

So the main character, Bella doesn't have anything, like literally anything, she is an average student, she doesn't play sports, she doesn't come from a rich family and has zero social skills, the only thing we can say is probably she is beautiful but no.

No she isn't. She is described as an ordinary looking person, this illusion that she is beautiful comes from the fact that every other guy is falling at her feet for absolutely no reason because as I mentioned she, well, doesn't have any personality traits that might be attractive or special moments/ friendships with these guys or anyone for that matter, so she must be drop dead gorgeous..


And from Edward's pov she is described as beautiful but let's ignore that, one other trait is that she is kind, but when?, when is the novel was she kind , she is always judging people in her head, is very selfish ( not in a evil way but still) and the only part where we can say that she may be a kind person is her consideration of her parents, but news flash all humans love their parents Edward, like is the bar for next mother Teresa really this low for you.
The girl in a walk to remember was kind, shoko in a silent voice was kind, sofie in howls moving castle was kind.

With the description that is provided of bella from him and how others treat her you'd think bella is someone really cool but in reality she is below average, just like every other teenager, just like I was in high school.
And that's where this story draws it's fanbase from, bella despite having nothing to offer, despite doing nothing for other/herself or in general is having the time of her life with her billionaire hot vampire boo and his billionaire hot family and she has this love triangle situation that isn't complex like it'd be in real life , it's just aesthetic, just how teenagers imagine, she is the special girl at school despite no social skills, it's all that unreal fantasy teenage world that almost every high schooler would be obsessed with, but when they grow up, twilight is a book they can never go back to.

But this story continues to be popular as new teens find it and on the cycle goes.
What are your thoughts I'd love to know.

qozijb,"Do we think there will be anything even marginally as big as HP, Twilight or Hunger Games anytime soon?","For context, I was born in 95 so I was there for the Harry Potter, Twilight & Hunger Games craze, and to be honest *I miss it*.  The closest I can think of would be the mid 2010’s Game of Thrones phenomena, which was due in large part to the very successful HBO show. 

I know that the world was pretty ripe for those series in that time frame, and it was a combination of luck, the right audience, and a sense of “you just had to be there”, but it just really seems that anything else since has almost missed the mark. I mean, HP basically created the YA genre as we know it. I understand that we usually get at least one big series with an almost cult like following at least once a decade, but what’s going on? Was it just chance that so many books became that huge within one decade? 

Some people will say that kids don’t read as much anymore but I don’t buy that. Give them something amazing, on point, engaging and kids WILL read it. 

Am I just reminiscing about days gone by, caught up in my own nostalgia? Was it really the end of an era after 2012? Will anything ever have that much hype again? Be a household name? Have adults and teens and kids alike awaiting the next release? I really miss those times, to be honest. Again the closest thing was GOT but after the disastrous ending of S8, and GRRM probably dying before releasing book 6, nothing has really come across my radar as having even anywhere near that amount of traction. There are some dedicated fan bases for others series out there, but nothing like what we saw.  I think if there was a series of that caliber, we’d know. 

What do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qozijb/do_we_think_there_will_be_anything_even/,2021-11-07T22:28:14Z,215,192,books,Twilight,POST
18lbi6t,The romance in twilight>> 90 percent of modern romance and i’ll die on that hill,"obviously i’m exaggerating with the title because i haven’t read 90 percent of romance but if you are sick to death of enemies to lovers like i am then you will understand that rereading twilight was like a breath of fresh air. they actually *like*  each other. yeah they’re like bickering for the first part but it’s so obvious that Bella is super into Edward and after the halfway part they don’t even bother to do the will they won’t they. they totally will. And that’s what feels so refreshing.

They’re both gloomy weirdos who think they’re better than the people around them. They read the same books. Bella thinks edward is hot, if he watches her sleep she literally doesnt care. and it’s a vampire story the appeal of the creepy weird hot guy has been documented for ages. a lot of romances have enemies to lovers with nothing in common, they couldn’t hang out or have fun buying groceries but i totally believe Bella and Edward could. it’s not even a love triangle; Bella never wants Jacob. 

but really is edward is a creepy stalker? yeah a little, and that’s ok. because bella is totally cool with it. bella would also be a creepy stalker if she could. she’s immediately obsessed with him despite him literally telling her to leave him alone. these two pretentious losers only care about each other the entire series and it’s so compelling. like the two anime kids from high school who get married. compared to romances that are creepy and stalkerish with the female character being like hey stop doing that and the dude almost never does. 

the twilight books are a mess of misogyny, racism, and weird plots but the romance is totally believable and understandable. edward is the only person to make bella feel any sort of desire and understanding. no wonder she latched onto him so hard, and he did with her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18lbi6t/the_romance_in_twilight_90_percent_of_modern/,2023-12-18T15:33:40Z,48,0,books,Twilight,POST

The second book was a little boring though I thought Jacob had good character development.  Eclipse and Breaking Dawn I  thought were not that good, i thought a lot of the characters weren't healthy to each other.  

Anyway overall I thought that the series was ok, it definitely should've stopped at the end of the first book.

Anyway, there has been no series/book that I have read as fast as those dang twilight books when I was 14. I've gotten flak for reading them but as I grew I learned to not care. I used to not admit that I liked them. I hid them in my closet even.

The writing isn't the best, but God I was in love with them. The type of story is totally something I can see a teenage girl fall head over heels for, as I did. I honestly read the last one in a couple days. I would stay up until I literally was falling asleep reading. I remember having to do history homework and would make myself read one paragraph of history and then in chapter of twilight. I was obsessed...it was like an addiction. They aren't even my favorite books I've read, just the fastest. 

So did anyone else share in the obsession? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/50p3ea/did_you_read_the_twilight_saga/,2016-09-01T19:37:26Z,48,4,books,Twilight,POST

You might know me from my most recent novels: A Gathering of Ravens (2017), and its sequel, Twilight of the Gods, which came out yesterday!  Or, you might know me from my work on Marvel's The Savage Sword of Conan -- I wrote the back-up prose novella, ""The Shadow of Vengeance"".  My published work runs the gamut, from ancient historical fiction to historical fantasy to some straight-up secondary-world fantasy.  You can find more information at my website https://scottoden.wordpress.com/ or at my publisher's website https://us.macmillan.com/author/scottoden.

I live in North Alabama with my wife, Shannon, and our two dogs. When not writing, reading, or dog walking, I enjoy pen-and-paper RPGs, video games, and armchair archaeology.  I'm here all day!  Ask me anything!

y6d7i6,"Why Harry Potter, Twilight, Hunger Games and now Colleen Hoover are so successful?","A book's popularity depends on a number of factors: cover, storytelling, prose, marketing, luck, and how that story speaks to the cultural zeitgeist of the moment.

For example:
- Harry Potter: the prose isn't great, but it's accessible (perfect to conquer those who don't have a reading habit), JK Rowling is fantastic in the choice of scenes she decides to show (especially in the first three books) and the mix of magic + underdog story + slice of life + wishful story came at the right time.

- Twilight: again, accessible prose and the myth of immortality + eternal beauty + touches of supernatural really captured the popular imagination, especially of women, who are generally more affected by the act of aging.

- Hunger Games: competitions + love triangle + dystopia was a market that had not yet been consolidated. Suzanne Collins said the idea came when she was changing the channels and they were switching between the Iraq War and reality TV shows - it captured the zeitgeist of the moment, somehow.

- Colleen Hoover: Yes, she's still not quite as famous globally, but today (October 17th) from the top ten on the New York Times bestseller list, seven are hers. She’s just one movie adaptation away to become the phenomenon that she already seems to be in the USA. Although I find her prose extremely simplistic, her success is undeniable. And she's bringing more and more non-readers into the literary world, which is good. I don’t understand yet why she’s so successful.

vw68zj,"Is there a reason we don't see any completed movie adaptation of books like the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Twilight series?","So I (like many others) am a huge fan of the Harry Potter movie series. They did a great job staying true to the books and really giving us visual aids for the Hogwarts universe. The movies made millions (probably billions, total), and are some of the only movie adaptations I see people having mostly positive things to say about them.

That being said, every time a book series that I liked growing up gets a movie adaptation, it's always a one-and-done? Granted, the ones I've seen have been pretty terrible cashgrabs that take too many liberties with the source material (looking at you, *Lightning Thief* and *The Giver* ...) I'm just curious it there's some reason I'm missing that we can't have another great cinematic universe like Middle Earth or the world of Hogwarts, or even Twilight (not a fan, but I know those movies are huge)?

Is it budget? The fact that many things that came after these three series are pretty much considered ""derivative"" at this point?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vw68zj/is_there_a_reason_we_dont_see_any_completed_movie/,2022-07-11T01:17:27Z,40,0,books,Twilight,POST

6azh2f,Reread the Twilight Saga recently...,"I first read them in Middle School, and in particular read Breaking Dawn enough that the cover came off. This was not necessarily because I was a huge fan; my family used to make cross-state trips every summer and winter, and I would read them in the car.

And then the movies came out; I found the first meh, the second bleh, the third bad, and the fourth/fifth was up and down. 

I thought at the time that it was a case of poor adaptation, and after finding my old books in a box, and I decided to reread them... and I hated them. The writing felt too simplistic, the characters wooden, the plot fairly unsound, and the whole thing felt rushed. There were great scenes, I will admit, and good concepts, but the book would need to be longer and more detailed to really deliver on those concepts. So then I wondered, why did I like these as a kid? The answer, I think, is that I'm big on worldbuilding, and in those car rides, and I'd take breaks. Often I'd daydream how I thought the scene I had paused in would go, how the rest of the book would go. Even when I had already finished them before I would just think about how *I* would do the scene, the dialogue, and the plot in those breaks. I think that altered my view of the books, as my head was full of romance and cool concepts of my own, inspired by what I had read, and thus that excitement made me feel the books were better than they were.

**TL;DR**: Used to love the Twilight books, reread and hated them, realized I had been daydreaming of better books when I had first read them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6azh2f/reread_the_twilight_saga_recently/,2017-05-13T18:52:28Z,20,33,books,Twilight,POST

I’ve even found myself doing it over the last few weeks. it’s started to really grind my gears and here’s why: 

1.  It’s bullshit 
2. I don’t feel the need to justify any of the other content I consume.
3. If you’re judging someone for the content someone consumes that say way more about you than it does about me. 
4. Framing our love for these books in this way furthers they idea that people do/should/can judge other people for their choices in content.

Also, I have a feeling that this story had a potential and a really good one but was screwed up by the shitty author.

A young teenager falling in love with a vampire and all that written in the modern age. In my opinion, it had a good potential but alas Stephenie Meyer happened

So a week or so ago, this topic about books ""like twilight for men""  came up on the front-page and this top comment got my attention.
(https://np.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3eo80r/whats_the_male_equivalent_of_twilight/ctgtfkb) 

So having just finished my last book, i found myself interested and got the first book. Followed by being down with the flu i read all 6 in the week.  
As you might summarize from that: i REALLY like those books. But i honestly don't know why. 
 
Because mostly the writing is semi-decent but it doesn't hold a candle to Sword of Truth, and while the context is pretty interesting it's all pretty over the top & is modern day, which i normally hate. So i'd like your opinions about this. 
 
Besides the obvious power fantasy of Guns, Guts & sex - is there a reason these books pulled me in (much like twilight & such had a big pull on women)? And can i expect to like more books in this genre, or are these books a fluke in the genre?
  
&nbsp;  
  
ps: I want more. 6 books is to little. :'(

he6onq,"i just reread the twilight saga, and i can't believe how much i still love it","hear me out!  it has its issues, for sure.  but i also think it has a lot of excellent aspects that are overlooked because of the harmful/abusive parts of edward and bella's relationship (and the fact that it's largely considered ""uncool"" due to its appeal to a largely young female audience).

i want to emphasize that i am speaking strictly about [the books](https://www.goodreads.com/slothdad_); the movies are a whole different beast that i'm not ready to get into lol

overall, even with it's issues, the saga withstands the test of time in a lot of aspects. the fantasy elements take old creatures with familiar stories and add unique twists and changes that make it appealing to a YA audience without changing the essence of those tales so much as to not resemble the source material. the romance elements are weak, but i think that's pretty typical for YA books. by contrast, i think this series handles the importance and significance of platonic and familial relationships - the ones that come easily and the ones that challenge us, the ones we are born into and the ones we choose - extremely well.  the quileute history/tribe dynamic is interesting and well thought-out, with the only real flaw being that the ""third wife"" hero goes unnamed in their most impactful legend.

i also don't have any issue with the imprinting thing that so many people seem to have. it doesn't feel like grooming or pedophilia in any way; meyer does a good job of explaining the tribal experience of undying love and desire to protect which is more important than any sexual or even romantic relationship with people on whom imprinting takes place. quill and his claire, jacob and nessie.... it's never portrayed as creepy or predatory, and i think it's disingenuous to make such implications. especially when you take the werewolves stunted aging and nessie's accelerated growth/explicitly explained eventual stunted growth into account.

seriously, i think that if i had to choose, i would put the twilight saga above the harry potter series, but below the hunger games trilogy in terms of my favorite YA series.  granted, i still need to read the harry potter series through an adult lens (i think i was 17 the last time i read them.  i'm 26 now).  given the recent confirmation that jk rowling's a [TERF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERF), though, i don't know if that's something i'm interested in doing any time soon..... time will tell!

so what do you think?  have you read this series recently?  not since it was huge?  if you've read it more than once, has your opinion changed?  do you agree or disagree with any of my points?  i'm dying to talk about this with someone, anyone! lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/he6onq/i_just_reread_the_twilight_saga_and_i_cant/,2020-06-23T03:01:10Z,10,0,books,Twilight,POST

2oxer5,So I was listening to Twilight today...,"Hold up, hold up, settle down. Allow me to explain myself.

So I was listening to a reading of Twilight by [Shaggy Shan](http://uberfriendship.com/category/shaggyreads) over at [UberFriendship.org](http://uberfriendship.com). He does a very funny reading with a nice amount of editing and personal touches that, at least to me, are hilarious enough to want to listen. The readings are in response to donations to various charities. 

[Link for the curious.](http://www.uberfriendship.com/shaggyreads/01%20SRT%20-%20Chapter%2001%20-%20First%20Sight.mp3)

As I was listening I thought of something. The premise of Twilight is actually quite interesting to me. And no, not the ridiculous vampires, or the ridiculous native american werewolves or the ridiculously shallow main character. I am talking about the most distilled version of the premise:

Character A has been around for an unnaturally long amount of time (say a century) and can read minds. During that century, there hasn't been a single person who's mind (s)he hasn't been able to read. Character B comes along and is the first person whose mind cannot be read. This is fascinating to Character A who for the first time in a long time knows someone who is a genuine mystery. Character A suddenly has to ask questions again, (s)he can be confused, or perplexed or stumped, which is something that hasn't happened in over 100 years.

I think that premise is very interesting and worth exploring further. Of course Stephanie threw all that out in favor of the creepy stalking, the dull characters, the horrible mythology, the most boring love triangle in the history of mankind, and a main character whose only traits are the uncanny ability of sensing the precise amount of ""tightness"" in one's eyes and a penchant for comparisons between people and Classical Hellenic sculpture.

Anyway I don't think I've seen this particular point brought up anywhere, or found a book with something even similar to this premise. And I think a well written story with good characters, you know, with actual personalities exploring this theme could potentially be really good.

Anyway, that's what I thought about today. Also for the record:

Team Mike Newton

Favorite character: Charlie

Yes, I gotta admit I do like Twilight and it’s been a guilty pleasure since I was younger. However I’ve always HATED Breaking Dawn. I don’t like the strange tone or the pacing or especially the forced way it ends the series.
One of the things that drew me to the series was how tragic it kinda was.This girl had to not only choose between her family and the boy she loved, but between the boy she loved and also her best friend. The series was built on Bella being tortured by difficult choices and in the end she doesn’t choose anything and gets everything.

3j5i3f,Does Twilight Borrow from the Fables Comics?,"I recently began reading the Fables comics by Bill Willingham (which I absolutely recommend to any fantasy lovers), and I've come to notice some unusual similarities between these comics and the Twilight series (by Stephenie Meyer). If you're skeptical, so am I, but I'm not seeing any of these comparisons pointed out elsewhere online, and the timing and specificity of these cases just seems too glaring for me to leave unmentioned. All of the evidence I mention below is from issues released a couple years before Twilight was first published - seemingly perfect timing for the ideas therein to inspire Meyer as she went on to create Twilight. *Disclaimer - I have watched all of the Twilight movies, but not yet finished all of the books, so forgive me if I confuse the two at any point.* Some very minor spoilers for both storylines will follow: 

**Evidence 1: Bigby Wolf and Snow White**

http://imgur.com/HYlFhST

Bigby is one of the main characters in Fables. He was once known as The Big Bad Wolf, but centuries later, he now lives in New York City, disguised as a human. However, he can still transform into wolf form when needed, and often does so to protect his love interest and fellow main character Snow White. Very much like Jacob of Twilight often does to protect Bella Swan. 

[Some readers](http://www.shmoop.com/twilight/isabella-bella-swan.html) have already pointed out that Bella both translates to and sounds like Belle, as in Beauty and the Beast (two characters which are also included in the early issues of Fables), but it's also hard to ignore the surname Swan here. Swans as we know are famous for their perfect ~~Snow~~ white feathers.

Bigby even describes his initial attraction to Snow White the same way that Edward from Twilight describes his powerful attraction to Bella. In Twilight, the smell of Bella's blood draws Edward in a way that no other person's does. He's also completely unable to read her mind, unlike every other human he's encountered. 

Here's the strikingly similar explanation from Bigby in Fables issue #16: http://imgur.com/JmeqKXD

**Evidence 2: Jack in the Civil War**

http://imgur.com/VRWv9hd

Jack Horner, like the rest of the characters in Fables, is immortal. In his pseudo origin story from the early comics, we're told the tale of his brief participation in the American Civil War. He fights as a Confederate soldier, even adopting an over the top phony Southern accent, but eventually abandons the war and moves on. 

Jasper Hale, one of the main vampires from Twilight, and famous for his noticeable Southern accent, also fought for the South in the American Civil War. He is also Blonde just like Jack, and possesses an overpowering manipulative charisma. Just like Jack. In this same one-off Civil War story from issue #11, Jack fools the Devil in a game of cards and tricks a beautiful dying woman into sleeping with him. 

Jasper's origin story revolves around a vampire named Maria. He comes across her as he travels in his confederate uniform, and she transforms him into an immortal like herself. They are lovers for a short time, but ultimately she cannot forget her deceased mate.

In the Fables issue, Jack, still in his confederate uniform, encounters a beautiful woman named Sally, whose entire family is deceased. He uses a magic bag to suck up the Grim Reaper as it approaches Sally, and thus she becomes immortal like him. As repayment, they make love all night and for many days after, until he moves on and the story ends. 

http://imgur.com/YNQXGOj

**Evidence 3: A Two-Part Caper**

Issues 12 and 13 of Fables tells the brief story of a human journalist who discovers the immortal community in NYC. He has been following them and compiling evidence, and at last concludes that there can be only one explanation for their apparent immortality. THEY MUST BE VAMPIRES. Seriously. Here's the screen grab:

http://imgur.com/jvVHMnX

Interestingly, the fanatic journalist even mentions Anne Rice, a fellow fantasy writer who had some [minor beef](http://www.themarysue.com/rice-versus-meyer/) with Stephenie Meyer and her famous sparkly vampires. 

Anyway, that's all I've got so far. Seems compelling to me, but I suppose it could very well be coincidental. Interested to hear what Twilight and Fables scholars have to add. 

Cheers,

Zen

TL;DR: 
Edward + Jacob = Bigby Wolf.
Bella = Snow White.
Jasper = Jack.
VAMPIRES.

I'm just so full of anxiety I don't dare post on my account. If that's against the rules please let me know. I didn't see anything about it. I honestly feel intimidated by all you lovely readers/writers!

---

I grew up with a brother who loved to read. You name it, he would read it. Science, how things work, fantasy, fiction and non fiction alike. I am very close to my brother, so I naturally picked up his hobbies. We played Legos, I helped him with science sets. When he took apart radios to put back together I sat with him. Since he read books, I thought *I* should also read books. 

I tried to read his books. They were very interesting stories, but I just couldn't bring myself to like them. Or like reading. I tried for many years. In elementary school we were required to read for 30 minutes a day, and then write a journal about it. I would always just stare at the page, turning the page when the person next to me did. I'd skim over some of the words, enough that I could write a quick summery. 

This followed me into book reports. We would do group book projects. The books were always interesting to me, but I just couldn't get into it. The morning it was due I'd just skim through the pages while brushing my teeth. Enough that I could answer questions, and pick up whatever I missed from my assigned book group. 

Around the age of 13 I got into a very dark place. My home life wasn't great, I was failing at school, and I just needed drama. So I raided my Mom's books. She had things like Jay's Journal, Johnathan Livingston Seagull, really 'out there' writing styles that did nothing but drop my mood. I didn't understand them. To be honest I mostly read them because I felt like they were forbidden. 

We did read one single book in school I did enjoy. Number The Stars. I loved it! The drama, the escape, the suspense. We read it aloud in class, so I could follow along. After that I needed more. I tried picking up a few more books from my library. They'd always end up dusty on a shelf, untouched. 

Finally the Twilight Craze hit. My aunt - about 48ish at the time - was obsessed. She gave my Mom a brand new copy around Christmas, insisting she *must* read it. Needless to say, it sat in a pile, untouched. 

Then one day we had the electric turned off. I was used to it, since we always had one utility or another being shut off. I was very bored, however. Very bored. After seeing Twilight sit in a pile for months on end I figured what the heck. I needed something to do. I'm still not sure why I chose that book. 

After page one I was hooked. I was obsessed. I stayed up until 6am to finish the book. I read an entire book a day. My brother was going to school at the time - I'd dropped out due to failing grades and being sick - and as luck would have it, he had the entire series in his library. At the time the public library had a hold of over 100. He brought me a new book each day. I'd read through it, give it back, and pace until the next book. 

Finally the end came. I ranted about it to anyone who would listen. I read fan stories on the internet. It wasn't enough. I needed more. I needed vampires. Looking back on it now I can see that it's due to a sense of control, and the ""I have no emotions"" aspect of it. At the time I just knew I needed more. I would run to the library, looking for anything and everything vampire related. 

I discovered Goodreads, and would look through there daily for more stories, cross referencing them with the library. I'd make a list of exactly where the books were when we went to the library. I'd leave with sixteen at a time, finishing them all by the time they were due. Needless to say, I wasn't getting much sleep. 

That was the year I read over 100 books. I know, I tracked them in Goodreads. Granted, they were all short books, but still. I was proud of myself. 

This went on for roughly three years. Once in a while I'd throw in a slice of life book, or a fantasy book. But I'd always come back to my beloved vampires. I branched out to fallen angels after a while, then got hooked on slice of life/abuse books. From there I fell down the rabbit hole to fairy tale stories. Then Dystopia. Then Ye Olde Days with magic. Back to Dystopia. Every type of book I would become obsessed with, I'd have to find at LEAST ten more before my hunger was satisfied. 

my boyfriend at the time finally got fed up buying me books. It was too costly. He bought me a Kindle instead, and turned a blind eye to what I did with it. I was still very, very poor, and couldn't afford even Ebooks. I admit I did some... not exactly legal things to get my book fix. I always stuck to young adult books since the fiction scene wasn't great at the time. They were also fast, easy, didn't require a lot of thinking, and great stories. 

When the books didn't scratch the itch, I began to write the books I DID want. I think I began writing in my vampire/suicide phase. I wrote some pretty terrible plots, as well as some pretty amazing ones. My creativity flourished. It was something *MINE*. I used my creativity to branch out into the real world, designing costumes. I now design costumes professionally for local theaters at budget prices. I love costuming more than I love to breathe. I NEED it. 

I finally got to the point where I realized I couldn't handle just one type of book. I'd download the top ten best sellers in young adult, toss them on my kindle, and read them without knowing what they were about. I found some AMAZING books that way. I also found some horrible books. For a while I made it my mission to only read horrible books. 

As the years have gone on, I've settled my book reading down. This year I'm on track to read 60 books. Again, still young adult. I've read some harder books as well - still YA, but with more 'bulk' to the text. I'm now happy reading for an hour a night, vs having to stay up until six am the next day to finish a book. I often revisit my favorite books in my head and make up new stories as I fall asleep. I can't reread a book ever, since I already know the plot. 

I now look back and worry. My spelling/grammar is cringe worthy. I can't comprehend 'big books' very well. I read quickly, without really memorizing details. I often skim over entire paragraphs of details, or forget things like someone in the book is black - a key part of the book. I worry that I've ruined my writing skills. I worry that I'll never be able to read Steven King, or The Hobbit, or any of those books and enjoy them. They're just not interesting to me. The general fiction scene is better now, with more verity, but I still prefer my YA. I've put up with horrible glares in the library because I'm 'too old' to be in that section, or 'one of those people' who are Twilight fans. 

Finally I was diagnosed with OCD/ADHD. I also have anxiety off their measuring charts. And depression. With this came new medication, allowing me to settle and FINALLY go back and pick up all the schooling I've missed. Mostly English and writing skills. I don't think I'll ever enjoy the harder books. I'm too flighty - like a bird - to stay focused that long. I still feel like a kid when I read book forums - you all sound so mature! - but I'm finally able to sit and work on WHY I feel that way. If I read slowly - a challenge itself - I can understand harder books. My goal is to read two hard books this year. 

My book journey began with the Twilight craze, and ended up with me designing costumes, being so creative it just bursts, and a newfound love for writing. It's offered me an escape when reality was too hard. It offered me freedom, other worlds, a joy in my very dark world. Designing costumes, writing, creating cakes in my head - non of these would have happened without the Twilight craze. Even my AD/HD would have been harder to pinpoint. 

I'm starting back at grade school English/math, picking up what I've missed. I'm learning how to write all these fantastical stories I have in my head - and enjoying it, vs worrying about grammar/spelling. 

I'm moving forward in life - I'm marrying my then boyfriend next month - and I owe it all to Twilight. I'm now 25, though I feel 15, and my love for books hasn't even begun to fade.

As I said, I'm now challenging myself to read two 'adult' books so I don't feel so silly in the library, but I know what I like and I'm okay with that. I feel silly challenging myself to only two books, since I read so many. I no longer think those people who challenge themselves to read two books a year are silly. 

I hope my love for books never fades. I love telling children stories I come up with to keep them happy. I love bringing light to their worlds. 
-------

Anyway, there's my ramble for the night. I also challenged myself to get out of my comfort zone and be social. Books are something I'll always hold dear to my heart. Even if you delete this post, take down this site, destroy my Kindle, I'll still have the stories in my heart. You're free to ignore this post, I just wanted to share. 

To anyone who's struggling to find love in books, just wait. You just haven't found the right book yet. It took me 13 years to discover the book that opened my eyes. Don't give up, you'll find it. I hope for you it's simpler than having your electric turned off in Jan, however.

1fap3h,"Disagreement with the theory that in the Twilight series, Edward is a stalker and Bella is a weak role model.","Hopefully we can keep this discussion civil, and more importantly constructive._x000D__x000D_I've noticed a lot of people repeating this theory online, Reddit included, and I don't understand it considering that I read the same books they presumably did. For some background; I read the books because my sister (I'm a mal recommended them to me, and we tend to have similar reading interests. _x000D__x000D_While reading the first book I text her and asked why she recommended this crap to me. She promised me that the other books were better and I just had to push through the first. Well, she was right and I loved the rest of the series. _x000D__x000D_Now, the theory at hand. Rather than try to combat it, I will just present a counter theory. _x000D__x000D_Edward wasn't a stalker; he simply found his one true love and couldn't live without her. If he was really a stalker he wouldn't have left her at any of the times he did during the series: to try to kill himself, and with Jacob when they were luring Victoria, among others. He also would have wanted her to become a vampire to spend eternity with him, but instead was wholly against it. He was overprotective, but he still listened to Bella and let her live her own life._x000D__x000D_As for Bella, for me, it boils down to the same thing: she found her one true love and couldn't live without him. She tried to find interest in someone else (Jacob) and almost did, but it was a pale comparison to what she Edward had; real love. She was only submissive to him when it was necessitated by his presence and only when she was a human because he was incredibly stronger than her, physically. She often disagreed with him and did things he didn't want her to do. She stayed her own person and refused to compromise even in the face of the Voltaire. She was not only strong, she was shield everyone could stand under; the epitome of a mother. The other women in the books that Bella grew close to were also strong women._x000D__x000D_So, I really can't see where this stalker/weak theory has come from. If I missed something that validates the theory I disagree with, I'm very willing to listen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1fap3h/disagreement_with_the_theory_that_in_the_twilight/,2013-05-29T22:05:53Z,20,0,books,Twilight,POST

vktwan,LotR trilogy is boring,"I watched the movies and immediately bought the books, thinking they would be better. The book is always better than the movies. Not this time. I find the books extremely boring. I've never had any book put me to sleep before but these have.

Crucify me as you will. I'm on the third book, and will finish the series because I'm determined to, but I don't feel these books hold up to the hype I was exposed to when I said I was going to read them. 

In all fairness, however, I have read and reread all of AsoIaF, which I feel is the best series I've ever read, almost exclusively for the past two or three years. That might have something to do with it.

I'm disappointed LotR isn't more interesting.

11rze37,Rereading LOTR as an adult vs a teen has made the books 10x more enjoyable,"I loved LOTR as a kid.  All my friends were into it, I loved the movies and the battle scenes.  I loved the video games.   I loved the books too, but I can't say the process of ""reading"" them was as enjoyable as I'd like.  I think I just wanted to read it to get the full story and say I did it.  When I was 14/15 I think I read and reread the Fellowship of the Ring 3-4 times just because I would always get burnt out towards the end and have to start over.  It felt like a challenge but one that I wanted to finish.

Flash forward to now.  I'm 30 years old, and I never thought it was possible to enjoy reading 25 pages about Hobbit relationships in the Shire as much as I do now.  


I'm picking up so much humor and sarcasm that went over my head when I was a kid.  Instead of being bored to tears reading the description of every little grassy knoll, I'm now enjoying every word and fully being able to put myself in Middle Earth.

My girlfriend laughs at me because every night she finds me under the covers, listening to the movie soundtracks, and reading LOTR, for hours.

c552xt,First time reading of LotR,"Hi Readers,

I am quite an avid reader, however I have never read the LotR series nor have I seen the movies. 

I have finally decided to try and read them but since they are such a well loved series I figured I’d ask where to start. After looking them up on amazon (I’ll be reading on kindle) I noticed the collection of books I found were the “definitive” version of the books. Are these the best version of the books according to those who have read them?

And the hobbit I believe is a prequel? Should I read that first or is it best read after the series?

No spoilers please, yes I have seen all the memes etc.. but they make no sense to me not having seen the movies. That is the reason I’m asking here instead of google, as the books/movies are old enough where spoilers will be everywhere if I start looking for answers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c552xt/first_time_reading_of_lotr/,2019-06-25T08:22:17Z,30,60,books,Lord of the Rings,POST
dio9z2,I finished reading The Hobbit and LOTR and I'm so proud of myself!,"I have never read any content close to the reading level of LOTR before, and even when I was reading a lot more (middle school/early high school), I never read any books as long as LOTR. So when I started this journey, I was a little skeptical of my ability to actually finish The Hobbit, let alone LOTR. But I made my way through The Hobbit with relative ease, and really just wanted to dive into LOTR next. So that's exactly what I did. I started LOTR in July and (thinking that I would be very slow or maybe even quit) gave myself a goal of finishing it by New Year's. Well, I finished two and a half months early! I kept my reading to about a chapter a day during workdays, reading during my lunch break. and I am so excited to have finished it that I'm now going to dive into the Silmarillion! I know this is going to be a challenging read, but I'm so proud of myself for getting this far that I just can't let myself stop!

None of my friends or family really understand my level of pride and excitement for just reading a couple of books, so I needed to brag on myself a little on the internet. Hope you guys don't mind too much.

Edit: this got *way* more traction than I would have ever expected. I’m trying to keep up with the comments, but it’s getting difficult (especially since I’m busy reading again already).

gickne,"Last night I, someone who’s watched LOTR countless times, finished reading the trilogy for the first time. Here are my side-by-side thoughts:","**Brief Background**: My brother introduced me to the movies at 11. In the past 18 years I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen them all. My best friend used to have LOTR Sundays during college and play them in the background while we studied (she could always maintain studying, I never did). I’ve seen these movies an absurd amount of times.

**My Comparative Thoughts**

- Tolkien’s a true storyteller. So much so that he makes his characters natural storytellers, too. This at times fell a bit flat when characters told their experiences to other characters instead of us seeing them live. It felt very against the “show don’t tell rule” of good writing. It made me appreciate how the movie captured those scenes fully. But honestly, by the end I really found appreciation for this stylistic choice.
- With the movies, I tend to prefer the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli scenes, but in the books I found a lot more interest in the Frodo and Sam parts. Book 4 just may be my favorite overall. Definitely the one I read the fastest. **Edit**: Lord of the Rings is technically three volumes (FotR, TT, RotK) separated into 6 books, 2 books per volume. So the 4th book of LOTR solely focuses on Frodo, Sam, and Gollum’s travels up to Shelob.
- A bit specific, but Denethor’s death is **significantly better** than in the movies. The movie version seems so hokey now whereas the book truly captured his devolving to madness. Don’t think I’ll ever watch it the same. **Edit to specify**: Denethor’s running through Minas Tirith on fire vs him clinging to the palantír on the pyre is what makes it pretty cheesy for me. The latter is chilling and a better way to close his character’s arc.
- Last night I was prepared for the last 80 pages to drag, but I flew through them. There have been many times watching the trilogy where I’ll opt out after Aragorn’s crowning ceremony because it’s just a slow fizzle out, but the wrapping up in the book was so pleasant, intriguing, attentive and gave me the best sense of closure. I was gushing by the time I closed the book because I sincerely loved the way Tolkien brought the fellowship’s story to a close. 
- **Edit** because I keep getting screamed at about it: Tom Bombadil is certainly a cool character. He’s whimsical, thoughtful, truly loves his wife (aw), got songs4days, and he’s subtly (to be read in an Always Sunny Mac voice) *badass*. To be the only character (even including Sam) to casually throw on the ring and be like “Oh this ol’ thing?” and throw it back to Frodo is fuckin cool, man. **But** I really have no problem with him not being in the movies. If they threw him in for 5 minutes pre-Bree it wouldn’t have been justified enough. If they gave him a proper 15-20 minute scene, it would’ve taken the *Fellowship* overboard. That’s it y’all. That’s just me.

**Potentially Embarrassing Confessions**
- The number of times a non-movie character was spoken of and I thought, “ehh that’s probably the name of one of their horses” was too many.🤦‍♀️
- Why did I *always* think Théoden was Eowyn and Eomer’s dad?! I’m sure the movie acknowledges he’s their uncle, but I’ve overlooked that many, many times.

**Dumb Side Note**
- I can no longer read Lothlórien without singing it to the tune of the Pixies “Velouria.” 🎵My Loth-ló-rien. My Loth-ló-rien🎵",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gickne/last_night_i_someone_whos_watched_lotr_countless/,2020-05-12T14:46:54Z,1123,9087,books,Lord of the Rings,POST

16q90d6,LOTR assignment opinion question,"Okay, so I am a HS English teacher and my Senior honors kids must read a British lit novel for a research project. One bold soul chose LOTR. This kid (like most in my classes, alas) is not a reader. 

Rather than fail the assignment,  I thought perhaps he should read 1 of the books and watch the extended movies for the others.   (Realistically,  there is no way this kid is going to read them all, and the assignment only requires them to read a novel of min 400 pages.)

I want your opinions: if he is going to read 1 of the three which should it be? I thought perhaps Return, as it is quite different from the films and has some beautiful anglo-saxon inspired speeches. That way he would already have the visuals of the Nazgul and Rivendell, and the Shire, and some great battles. However, Fellowship novel also has the meeting at Rivendell with all that history which isn't included except briefly in the opening voiceover, and some Elvish songs...  [Note: I have read the novels multiple times over the years, but not recently‐-I'm hoping you LOTR experts have some specific opinions]

12yehuo,Reading LOTR for the first time in my life!,"I am a person who has never watched the LOTR, and has never really delved much into the realm of classic fantasy. 

This week, I had some unanticipated free time. So, I decided to branch out with my usual reading genre. I first picked up the Earthsea trilogy and read that. Fell in love with the language, characters, and world-building. Then I went for the Hobbit. Thoroughly enjoyed myself, devoured the book.

Now, I've started on the LOTR. I am in love. In love. With the world-building, the language, the characters. I love how it starts with this fantastic introduction to the hobbits. I love Goldberry and I want to draw her (I doodle/draw a lot). I love Frodo and Bilbo of course and all the hobbits. I feel so happy and immersed in this beautiful fantasy world and the escapism from stress. And I have a whole 1000+ book of this to look forward to. I am just so happy with this universe Tolkien created, I've even indulged in a few sketches inspired by how I imagine the characters/setting in my head (drawing is another one of my hobbies, alongside reading). It sounds silly, but every day this week has been made brighter by fantasy. I feel like I have something to look forward to every morning and it's been motivating. I feel happy, youthful, imaginative. It makes me a bit sad that I never picked up these books as a child/teen. I was a voracious reader but I thought that the books would bore me because they were ""classics"" and there was a point in my life where I equated that with boredom. Then, in junior high I actually enjoyed most of the classics we read at school, but I preferred to stick to the same books that I was used to rather than delving into the world of Tolkien. But it's never too late, and I'm so so glad I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and tried!

This has turned into a rant and a half so I apologize but wow. I love this book so much and I'm really really enjoying myself.

I think that, if I could understand the ways that the characters and events of his work are tied to the real world people, events, places, and themes of the Great War, I would find the stories he wrote much more compelling.

* He meets and is accompanied by a tall, silent, skilled swordsman type (Lan vs Strider)
* Also a staff-wielding wizard (Moirelle vs Gandalf)
* Also his other best friends who are kind of comic relief (Perrin/Mat vs Pippin/Merry)
* The night the adventure starts there is a large party (Bel Tine vs Bilbo's/Frodo's birthday)
* Involving a well-loved supplier of fireworks (Padan Fain vs Gandalf)
* The evil creatures attack a small town during the night (Emonds Field vs Bree)
* In the town there is one family that has a reputation for causing trouble (Coplins vs Bill Ferny)
* The adventurers make a mad dash for a ferry (Taren Ferry vs Bucklebury Ferry)

cedlbb,At 30 years old I finally read The LOTR Trilogy,"I read The Hobbit years ago and loved it, absolutely loved it.  But, when I bought the LOTR Trilogy and started reading The Fellowship of the Ring, I just could not get into the book.  I don't know why and looking back I think I was expecting a book that was more like The Hobbit that was written for a younger audience.  I know now, that I just wasn't ready to fully appreciate these books.  And so, I put Fellowship down and never picked the books up again.

Sad to say, I would even tell people, ""Yeah I loved The Hobbit, but the other books are just a bunch of walking for chapters on end.""  I'm a bit ashamed at how I characterized the Trilogy based off my single attempt at reading them in my teens.  And yet, I was a huge fan of the movies.  I assumed that, for once, the movie adaptations were better than the books.  I even bought the extended cut DVDs of the LOTR Trilogy I liked them so much.  I never thought to pick the books back up and give them a proper second chance during all these years.

Recently, luckily enough, I started to see quite a few LOTR posts on Reddit that detailed all the little facts about the books that were missing in the movies.  I read these posts and was genuinely interested because, it seemed to me, there was a lot of the story missing that even the extended DVDs did not have time to cover.  My curiosity was peaked enough that now, at 30, I picked the Trilogy up again and finally made up my mind to read them.
I COULD NOT put these books down!  They were absolutely amazing.  I cannot believe that I ignored these books for years.  But, I believe that coming to these books now, at my age, allowed me to actually appreciate these books properly.

So, my advice; if you haven't read the books, please read them now, they are worth your time.  If someone told you that they are just a ""bunch of chapters of walking,"" let me apologize to you for them, they do not know what they are talking about.  If you were that person who, like me, tried to read these before and could not get engaged, please give them a second chance, you won't be disappointed.

1327vlx,Just Finished LOTR for the first time!,"Wow! I literally pulled an all-nighter to finish this. This trilogy was a crazy journey. I felt so immsersed/wrapped up in the narrative, as if I myself was living through the battles, wandering in an enchanted forest with all sorts of creatures. Tolkien's world building is truly something else, and I feel so strange now, back in the ""normal world"" with menial tasks and duties to fulfill, the normal daily hassles.

Little things I loved:

I love the Oliphants and Treebeard. I also love when Bilbo says ""what a pity"" and then he's like ""no, how silly of me"" when Frodo tells him he got rid of the ring lol. I think Bilbo is my favourite character despite his sparse appearances in LOTR as compared to The Hobbit.

I'm super proud of myself for pushing myself put of my comfort zone and trying this book. I felt that it would be way too challenging for my reading level but I always remember: I am reading for fun, for enjoyment, and i don't need to force myself to understand every little detail about every king, every single bit of Shakespearian-type dialogue, every single detail in the appendix. I view it as part of Tolkien's world building, this insane universe he created that I now miss so much. All of the characters that become dear to you as the novel progresses. What a masterpiece. I wish I could resurrect Tolkien from the dead to write a collection of bedtime stories occurring in an enchanted forest. He could also make a good sleep podcast or something imo.

3bqj80,"Finally picked up LOTR again after 15 years, and finished it for the first time. Some books are meant for different times in our lives. I'm so sad the story is over!","When I was around 11-12, I picked up the Hobbit and loved it. Afterwards, I started reading LOTR and was only able to read part of the first book, Fellowship of the Ring. I even remember the chapter I stopped on - Council of Elrond. It was too long and plodding for me at the time, but I vowed I would come back.  


Flash forward, I'm 26 and just finished the trilogy for the first time. I just put down Return of the King last night and got a little emotional. It had taken me so long to get back to these books! But I see now that even if I had pushed myself through them at 12, I wouldn't have fully understood the nuances of Tolkien's writing.    



His insights into the burdens of leadership through characters like Gandalf and Aragorn were particularly meaningful. As a kid, I still saw the leaders in my life as infallible, privileged, or corrupt. Now that I'm older, I understand that part of what it means to be a leader is to never be loved by everyone - to always be misunderstood by someone. To make tough decisions when there is no clear path, understanding that those decisions may go awry. 


I'm reading the books with my fiance, who has never been big into fantasy and tends to mock the books and characters from time to time. But Tolkien's writing meant a lot to me as a kid and now even more so as an adult. 


I'm looking forward to picking up my next read, but mourning a bit now that my adventure has come to an end! Though I guess Tolkien would say it's simply the beginning of a different adventure. The story goes on!

uq2d5v,Hello! Starting The Hobbit/LOTR book stuff.,"On chpt 5/6 of The Hobbit as of now, and despite knowing when it was written and by who, this book is so cute and unintentionally gay, and I love it. So far, it’s very playful even in the parts that are meant to be scary and serious, and I know it’s meant to be a kids book, but very cute nonetheless.

My main question is are there other books besides the main 4 (if there are any) that are worth a read before I start the three Frodo ones? Please try to be as little spoiler-y as possible, if you can. I know Tolkien has other Middle-Earth books: which are the easiest to start with for when I’m done with these?

Edit: I don’t know who Sam is, and I haven’t gotten to the Frodo books yet. That’s not what I mean by gay. There’s a bit of scenes at the start of the book that show Bilbo act in non-traditionally manly ways (I listed one in a reply). That’s all.

6rw8ow,LOTR: Books versus Movies,"I'd like to preface this with the fact that I did see the movies before I read the books so that does have an effect on my opinion on this matter.

Do you think the changes Peter Jackson made to Lord of the Rings as he adapted them into movies made the story better? Or do you believe that he should have the story largely as is? 

I'm not asking if people think the movies are better than the books because there are a lot of variables to be considered outside of the story itself in that discussion. I'm only wondering about the narrative itself. 

I personally like the changes that Peter Jackson made. I think he added a needed layer of depth to Aragorn that wasn't quite present in the book as Tolkien was very vague about him, especially his connection to Arawen. I also like that he gave the elves a change of heart and sent them to aid in the battle of Helm's Deep as they are largely absent from the conflict in the books. Faramir being tempted by the ring as he came across frodo in the movie was also a nice touch. 

I'd like to hear any thoughts about what other people like or dislike about the changes and why they think it makes the story better or worse .

After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a  breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City. 

What a beautiful scene. I am sure many have experienced a strong emotion while reading a particular passage.  I have cried while reading and laughed and wanted to sing. Anyone else?

My question is, why is this at the end of the Trilogy instead of at the beginning? I guess one may answer that youre suposed to discover those things through character dialogues, but that wont definetely happen in the first read. 

Either that or I'm really missing something.

yac6cb,What are the worst qualities of both LOTR and ASOIAF?,"These two series are wildly popular in a mostly positive light, but they also receive a lot of controversial critique. What are the weakest parts of both series, story and writing wise?

I personally think LOTR is weak when it comes to building the anticipation the reader needs to learn the answers to their questions. Tolkien often spoils the ending of the story long before you get there. 
The story maybe could’ve also benefited from more realistic and violent events, but maybe not. It feels a lot like a ride along (which can be great sometimes) but I wouldn’t exactly describe it as a “page-turner.”

For ASOIAF, I think GRRM in his reply to traditional fantasy has went out of his way to just contradict it. He doesn’t provide the feel-good, noble characters that you are always delighted to see in a scene. I think characters like that really build a connection between the reader and fictional world. Of course, there is Barristan Selmy as a sight for sore eyes, but I had hoped to see more characters in that light. Gandalf and Aragorn type characters would’ve balanced out the grey and muddy world that the complex characters of ASOIAF live in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yac6cb/what_are_the_worst_qualities_of_both_lotr_and/,2022-10-22T02:52:16Z,14,0,books,Lord of the Rings,POST

Now there *are* a few peculiar things about the author's writing I know could put some readers off. He has a tendency to repeat the same character descriptions over and over, and every once in a while the characters would do something that seemed... out of character.

But there's something extremely compelling to the novels, as well. The world is deep and beautiful, the flow of the story face-paced, with no dry parts that I've had to *force* myself to keep slogging through. There's time-travelling and between-world travelling (omg there's been some epic scenes that take place on *our* Earth, when they... Ah, I don't want to spoil it!) and all sorts of awesome.

And the characters really challenge the mold of a typical fantasy ""fellowship"". The group of unlikely heroes in The Last Rune are comprised of many complex characters, a few of which include: a bad-ass gay knight, a dark-skinned witch, and a young woman with a malformed arm, who is bullied for it in ways that may cause you to throw the book at the wall. :(

ADDED BONUS: One of my peeves with fantasy is that I can so easily guess which characters are going to romantically end up together in the end. It's like they follow some unspoken formula which I've subconsciously memorized. Or the authors just don't know how to write a romance that's not cliched. HOWEVER, it is not so with these books. Not so at all. Shhhhhhh.

Okay, so that's my two-cents worth. I really, really am loving these books. Admittedly I *do* have atypical taste sometimes, but I'm confident that there are a lot of readers out there that will fall in love with The Last Rune books!

pmnd9j,"I’ve tried reading Lotr 5 times now, should I try again???","I got into reading EXTREMELY late, and the hobbit was one of the first books I read, I think it was the second one. I loved it! Such a nice bite sized adventure, (of course back then it took me over a week to read it, maybe two or three) and it was such a nice pace with only brief glimpses of boring scenes.
(Also I was already big fans of both the Lotr and hobbit movies)
But as soon as I finished this special edition of the hobbit I bought a nice pocketbook fake leather bound set of all four books, and so I restarted the hobbit and continued on to The Fellowship of the Ring and god it sucked. I finished the first chapters saying “it’s gotta pick up soon, I mean they’ve been in the shire for decades at this point, it’s gotta get better soon.” It didn’t.
It was the old forest, and now all the complaining and walking was drenched in boring fog. Riveting.
I know I’m being kinda mean to the book, but I’m just trying to paint a picture.
Anyway I stopped there as reading further caused physical pain. Anyway I really wanted to continue, I felt drawn too it, I didn’t want it to beat me ya know. And everyone just praises this book like Jesus so I really wanted to be a part of that, I wanted to understand it. Anyway a few months later I picked it up again and restarted it, and got further.
I got to Tom Bombadil and I’m like, well this is kinda weird but honestly after just walking, talking, complaining, and so far nothing important happening yet, again, a third into the book, I actually found a liking for him. But then I got to fog on the barrow-downs and just couldn’t continue again. It was even worse than the old forest.
Than more months past, I read more book, and I started again, this time I made it to the Knife in the dark chapter, and it was more walking and complaining, so I stopped again but felt determined a few weeks later. So for a fourth time I gave it another shot, this time made it to Flight to the Ford and still couldn’t continue.
Anyway finally for a fifth time I started again, this time with an audiobook as well and made it to the council of Elrond, I don’t think I’ve read anything more boring in my life. That was a few months ago, and even though I’ve read all those chapter five times now, I still feel determined, should I give it another shot?
(Btw I was restarting each time, should I try again but take big breaks after boring chapters, or just quit altogether and just admit I don’t like it?)

Edit: I have decided, thanks to you all, to continue my attempts at reading Fellowship! I shall go further with new mindsets and new goals, doing everything in my power to push through.

* Is the translation of a book into another language that was originally in English mirrored when it comes to the books binding or reading format? (If you read said book translated in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian or Traditional Chinese)

6bsp2z,Finally reading LOTR!,"I recently got a Kindle Paperwhite.  I am no means a voracious reader, nor a fast reader.   My main issue is when I read epic books (Game of Thrones, LOTR, etc), I tend to zone out easily and have a hard time maintaining my focus and comprehension. 

The first book I downloaded was Lord of the Rings.  I have attempted reading this book probably like 4-5 times, and I'll give up by second chapter.  This time, I've gone much further.   

Wow - I'm really enjoying this book! It isn't so tedious.   I am a wee bit disappointed that I saw all the movies prior and there are some glaring differences between the two. 

I wish I have the capability to knock out a book or two a week, as my TBR list is getting huge.

Props to all who can do this! :)

6s5lmf,Finished The Hobbit and really enjoyed it. What should I know before starting the LOTR trilogy?,"**NO LOTR SPOILERS PLEASE** 

It took me a little while to finish, but I really enjoyed The Hobbit. I started fast, got a little slow in the middle, and sped through the finish of the book. Overall, I really enjoyed the book and liked Tolkien's world a lot. At the end, I felt compelled to dive deeper into it by reading the LOTR trilogy. 

However, I've heard many mixed things about the books. Many people call them the greatest fantasy epics of all time, while I've seen others call them convoluted and difficult to read. I know the writing style is quite different from The Hobbit, but I don't think it's something that I couldn't deal with. However, I wouldn't want to get bored by them if they ended up dragging on. 

Also, if it makes any difference on how I'd receive the trilogy, I have not seen the LOTR movies and have no clue what to expect from the books.

11nnlvw,"Fantasy books that are primarily journeys (usually walking) are bad and lazy imo. *minor spoiler for before they are hanged, LOTR and Eragon and god killer","So I think books that are mainly journeys like mentioned in the title are plot devices for when you don’t have a plot. They’re just there so characters have something to do otherwise yiur books would be 50 pages long cause the authors can’t think of what to put between events so they just put walking. And even when walking the characters develment isn’t good

I’m mainly thinking of LOTR, Godkiller and Eragon.

The first 200 pages of LOTR is a walking simulator. And when 1/5 of the book is describing what kind of road they’re on with no character moments it’s poor in my opinion 

Same points with Eragon and Godkiller

The book that kinda subverts this is before they are hanged. Joe Abercrombie as written in a journey with a wizard and it end up being completely pointless. However the character development and moments are amazing",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11nnlvw/fantasy_books_that_are_primarily_journeys_usually/,2023-03-10T12:17:25Z,36,0,books,Lord of the Rings,POST
gqi5lu,Comparing LOTR books to the movie series,"I would like to preface this by saying I'm in no way complaining about either the movies or the books. This is just a hobby of mine and I hope this may strike some discussion down in the comments. There's obviously a chance I may have misinterpreted either the books or movies. These are just my observations. 

I have a hobby of reading novels that were adapted into movies and television series so I can compare the differences. Usually I find it fun to read the little details that didn't make it to the final cut. I have always enjoyed the LOTR movies, having never read the books as a teen like so many others. The cinematics are beautiful and the story bright and captivating. 

Now having read the novels, I am a little disappointed to see how the adaptations handled how the characters interact with one another, especially in the case of Gimli and Legolas, and Gandalf and Pippin. In the movies, Gimli and Legolas have lots of banter back and forth, most likely to illustrate the way their 2 races don't necessarily get along. The scene outside the Black Gates, for example, where they mention dying side by side and agree to be friends. It was a powerful scene that is completely and 100% engineered by the screenwriters. Instead, the novels show us they become fast friends, with Legolas defending Gimli to other elves early on in the story, and they share a horse in the latter parts because Gimli is uncomfortable riding alone. Their friendship was touching and strong and they adventure together after the fact because they want to appreciate each other's interests. I know the subtleties of their 2 races not getting along might be hard to adapt to the big screen, but making them seem like they hate each other kind of grinds my gears now. 

The other thing I noticed was the interactions between Pippin and Gandalf. This completely changed Gandalf in my opinion. Movie Gandald seems often annoyed and almost mean to Pippin and by association, Merry, calling them fools and giving the air of annoyance almost at their very existence for most of the series. In short, I couldn't help but think to myself while reading ""why did they make Movie Gandalf such a jerk?"" I much enjoyed Book Gandalf to Movie Gandalf because instead of seeming aloof or annoyed, he seems more to me like he knows their usefulness even before they recognize it themselves. When Pippin peers into the Stone, instead of berating him as a fool, he explains later how the Stone works and its power that it holds over people. When Pippin laments not knowing the Stone's power or he would have let it alone, Gandalf explains it would only have increased the power if held over him (basically saying its not his fault, because the Stone was too powerful to begin with). Then when he pledges himself to Denethor later, he tells Pippin he basically had no other options. This is said with kind of a twinkle in his eye, implying Pippin was being a fool and that he found it amusing, but not openly berating him as an idiot like he does in the movie. 

These are my observations from having just finished the series for the first time. I still appreciate the movie adaptations for what they are, and they are extremely accurate to the novels to a point, which I very much appreciate. They will both have a place in my heart and are both classics that I will enjoy for many years to come.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gqi5lu/comparing_lotr_books_to_the_movie_series/,2020-05-25T20:02:11Z,19,8,books,Lord of the Rings,POST
hsuugq,"I love the LOTR universe, but I just can't get into the books","Title says it all. I really appreciate the legacy that The Lord Of The Rings created. I mean it's one of the biggest franchises of the fantasy genre and The Hobbit is commonly known as ""the first true fantasy novel"".

But I recently tried to read the books again. Probably for the fifth time or so. I just can't get past the first 200 pages. I'm always stuck at the first 100-150 pages. Usually I'm absolutely stuck with a book once I start it. But there's something about Tolkien's kind of writing that's just... Boring to me.

fbfytr,Audio books with amazing narration are in a league of their own. [LOTR and Rob Ingles],"I love audio books when the narration is absolutely on point.

The best example I've found of this is *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy plus the *The Hobbit* read by Rob Ingles. His voice perfectly matches the fantasy genre. He has a voice almost like David Attenborough. It feels like I'm being read the story by Gandalf himself. It ads to the atmosphere and really builds on top of the already amazing literature.

Recently, I also listened to *The Godfather* as read by Joe Mantegna and it was a other example of a perfect fit. Mantegna's voice and inflection just fit the story perfectly and really seemed to add to it. 

I think it's important to point this out because (for me at least) the reader of an audio book can absolutely make or break it. If you've had troubles with audio books before or are looking to get into them, I can't recommend a better starting point  than *The Hobbit*.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fbfytr/audio_books_with_amazing_narration_are_in_a/,2020-02-29T17:37:08Z,37,30,books,Lord of the Rings,POST

ih15dp,"If you enjoy complex, character-driven series like ASOIAF or LOTR (or if you enjoy other Epic Poems like The Iliad or The Odyssey) you should check out the Indian Epic called ""The Mahabharata"".","The Mahabharata has so many stories within stories within stories, and such a wide array of rich characters and plot-lines, and it has been described as ""the longest poem ever written"".

The overall plot is available on Wikipedia, but the basic story is one of familial conflict.

>The core story of the work is that of a dynastic struggle for the throne of Hastinapura, the kingdom ruled by the Kuru clan. The two collateral branches of the family that participate in the struggle are the Kauravas and the Pandavas. Both Duryodhana and Yudhishthira claim to be first in line to inherit the throne.  
>  
>The struggle culminates in the great battle of Kurukshetra, in which the Pandavas are ultimately victorious. The battle produces complex conflicts of kinship and friendship, instances of family loyalty and duty taking precedence over what is right, as well as the converse.

There are a lot of parallels between the plot and characters in Martin's ASOIAF series, and The Mahabharata. From an overarching perspective, the most glaring similarity is the focus of who will be ruling the empire, and this forms the basis of the central conflict in both narratives.

8lvazy,"I just finished ""A Hero Born: Legends of the Condor Heroes"" by Jin Yong, ""The LOTR of Chinese literature"". Has anyone else read it?","Jin Yong's books, ""A Hero Born"" \+ 11 more \(collected into 3 arcs\) have shaped the ""Wuxia"" \(Kung Fu novels\) genre and had a cultural impact on the Chinese\-speaking world I've seen compared to Star Wars and Harry Potter combined. Generations of young readers have stayed up past their bedtimes to read those books under their blanket, such as my wife who is from Taiwan. Naturally, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the English translation when it came out a couple of months ago. Back then, [there was quite a big thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7zntcw/volume_1_of_the_legend_of_the_condor_heroes_the/) here on r/books but  I haven't seen anyone mention that they have indeed read the book since then.

I just finished it today and must say I really enjoyed the story. I can see where the comparison to Tolkien is coming from, though of course if you go into that story expecting something close to typical ""western"" fantasy, you are in for a surprise. The *wuxia* genre seems to be a very own world with unique rules and stereotypes. Think: Reading your first fantasy novel when you have never heard of orcs and elves, wizards, dragons, magic swords etc before.

As an uninitiated western reader, I feel that many of the cultural allusions went over my head though and I was lucky that I could ask my wife about what this or that means, why people act a certain way etc.

All in all the book is very readable though, as the basic themes are the same as in the stories we know: heroes, beautiful maidens, villains, striving to overcome challenges and to bring justice to the world. And thanks to the fantastic job of the translator.

I would love to hear from anyone else who has read this book as there are not many English discussions about this out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8lvazy/i_just_finished_a_hero_born_legends_of_the_condor/,2018-05-24T19:14:23Z,35,191,books,Lord of the Rings,POST

aor7x7,Showerthought on LOTR: Sauron and Saruman should have focused less on rings and more on aerial superiority.,"Serious thought for a second here: I read The Silmarillion ages ago, and if I recall right, Morgoth, Sauron's old boss, nearly won the final war against him by sending out Ancalagon The Black and a bunch of other giant flying dragons, to the point the appointed gods had to get involved to stop it from being a total wreck.

What this basically proves is that aside from the eagles and that one flying ship in old myth, the good guys don't really have any great counters to flying enemies.

If Sauron, or even Saruman, had focused instead on making new and more powerful aerial monstrosities, rather then making or trying to find the secrets of rings of power, then odds are the books would have been very different. 

The Nazgul would have had flying steads right from the off, making hunting down Frodo easy. He probably would not have made it past Bree.

Gandalf's escape plot from Saruman of getting some eagle help would have been much harder, if not impossible.

The Roheriem would have been totally screwed, because your horses are not going to do much against flying beasts. Maybe the archers could do a bit of good but unlikely if there's lots of them.

Gonder might have fared better due to things like siege weaponry, but it takes time to load those.

Now I know it's not exactly the point of the book. Evil was never meant to win, and that is a good thing. But it's more of an observation then anything. Everyone always goes ""Couldn't the eagles fly them to Mordor"" but I don't think anyone really thinks of aerial strategies for the bad guys and how it would have helped THEM.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/aor7x7/showerthought_on_lotr_sauron_and_saruman_should/,2019-02-09T10:31:51Z,24,28,books,Lord of the Rings,POST

But there are things that i don't like about them:

1.  Too many songs in The Hobbit and TFOTR in my view.

2. Frodo and Sam usually hold each other's hand. 

3. Not enough descriptions about the battles. They are too short, unlike the movies.

jmkiz2,"LOTR is so good that even Eye of the World, a book heavily inspired by it, is highly enjoyable","I love The Lord of the Rings and Tolkein literature in general. I won't call myself a fanatic because I've yet to touch History of Middle Earth and Silmarillion. However, even 10 years after my tryst with the high fantasy epic, I crave the Middle Earth world. But like all things in life, an experience is only fully enjoyed the first time. So all is just a faint, nostalgic memory that heightens in winters.

I just finished reading Robert Jordan's epic -- Eye of the World. It picks up a lot of elements from LOTR, world building, names, story and even characterizations. I almost gave up on it but the way he's written is so captivating and I kept on reading. Have to say it's really rewarding and I might just go and explore the other entries in the Wheel of Time Series.

ty2nor,The Hobbit | Live Audiodrama | April 11 At 8 Pm EST / 5 PM PST- Hosted by r/LOTR_on_Prime,"# Hello folks!

On Monday, April 11, 2022 at 8 PM EST or 5 PM PST our subreddit r/LOTR_on_Prime is hosting a Live Audiodrama of The Hobbit. The company that will be voice acting this is called [Audiotorium](https://twitter.com/AUDIOTORIUMLIVE) and they are a Social Audio Production Studio.

# What is a Talk?

Reddit Talk is a new feature that is still currently in testing on Reddit where subreddits can host voice chat. Audiotorium previously hosted a Reddit Talk where they did a Halloween special. If you, or your subreddit is interested in applying for your subreddit to be approved to have Talk enabled you can find out more details on r/RedditTalk.

# What is the catch?

There is none, I promise. I am not here trying to swindle you fine folks into getting an extended warranty on your vehicle or have any personal gain. I simply want to do something that I believe is cool, drama free, and would show off the voice acting chops of the team while also showing off a new Reddit Feature.

# What do I have to do?

This part is simple. Just tune in when the event goes live. During the event you will be able to react to things with emojis and comment in the thread while its live. It is possible, once it is over, if you want to come up on the stage and talk to the team you can wave your hand ( its a button I promise ) and they can call you up to talk for a bit. Outside of that? Just listen to the experience and enjoy yourself. Its a child-friendly story and the cool part about a Talk is that if you are an audience member you can minimize your app if its the official reddit app and the audio will continue to play.

# Will we get a notification when this is live?

The way Talks work, to not spam the entirety of Reddit, you will only be notified that this event is live if you are subscribed to the r/LOTR_on_Prime subreddit. So what is my recommendation? Subscribe until the event goes live next week and then unsubscribe once its over if you do not wish to see discussions about the upcoming Rings of Power show. My feelings will not be hurt and I encourage it!

# What if I can't make it?

I completely understand that most of the world won't be able to make it live. One cool feature of the Talk is that is should record and be available later that night or the next day. Again, this feature is in testing and there could be hiccups.

# Have any other questions I didn't answer above?

Please drop a comment below and I will do my best to answer them. I ran this by the moderators on this sub before posting this here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ty2nor/the_hobbit_live_audiodrama_april_11_at_8_pm_est_5/,2022-04-07T02:23:47Z,2,5,books,Lord of the Rings,POST

8y8el1,"[Discussion +with likely spoilers] I've just finished Watership Down by Richard Adams, AKA 'LOTR for rabbits'","Friends,

I've just finished reading Watership Down and I thoroughly enjoyed it. (I've never seen the movie, but friends have and told me its a sad tale). Right from the start it captivated my imagination and interest. There was a real depth of thought that went into the book. I suppose, in a silly way, it got me thinking like a rabbit... and I enjoyed it! 

A few things that really caught my attention; 

Firstly, these rabbits seemingly live a BIG life with lots of drama and events, but in the grand scheme of things nothing occurs for them that spans a distance larger than a three mile radius. I reflected how our issues in life can be so small in comparison to the largeness of the world around us. 

Secondly, the way in which leadership styles are betrayed. Towards the end of the book during the siege when Bigwig is blocking the run from the invaders he shouts that he won't move unless his commanding officer instructs Him too. The opposing Woundwort and co are horrified at the thought of their being a bigger stronger rabbit than Bigwig, as to them the leaders are always the physically strongest of the lot. (Whereas Bigwig's leader is Hazel +Fiver who are small in statue but headstrong. 

Thirdly, the role that faith played in the book. There were a few parallels to Christianity (I'm a Church pastor in the UK). The particular story about El-ahrairah going up the mountain to sacrifice Himself to save His people seemed to be similar to God dying \[on the cross\] to save His people. More than that, the stories of faith and El-ahrairah brought them hope in the darkest moments. 

Hope this serves as a conversation starter. Be great to hear your thoughts on the book and the above.

God bless

Daniel

I just completed the Hobbit and am running through the Fellowship right now and was wondering when a proper time would be to watch the corresponding movies? I plan to read all 3 books in succession and can't decide if I should wait till the end to watch all 3 movies or watch each one after I finish that particular book.
  
  
Any suggestions? I have seen bits and pieces of all 3 of the movies, but have never really paid attention to what was going on. Would watching a certain movie before reading the next book spoiling anything?

Unfortunately, I can no longer find the thread or remember the exact words but I would absolutely LOVE to read it again and this time save it forever. The quote was in reference to Tolkien's obvious love and extreme dedication to the series and why it has sparked the same amount of love and devotion in his readers.

8brdua,I want to read so many classic fantasy books (LotR in particular)...but I can’t seem to get past a hundred pages because they’re so slow.. do I stick it out or just give up?,"I tried to read Lord if the Rings for the first time 2 years ago around this time, but I barely managed to get past the chapter where the team is freed from the trap of the trolls. Tbh I totally forgot the chapter... also I might be remembering completely wrong.

The entire beginning of the book,particularly the part after they leave the Shire, was just..slow. Maybe I’m totally spoiled from reading Game of Thrones where it’s just action from the get-go or any other fantasy books like Frankenstein.

I love the idea of reading Lord of the Rings because I love fantasy genre so much and I really want to read the trilogy that basically set the stage for the genre. But I just... I can’t. I feel silly for stopping so early when I feel as if I haven’t even tried to give it a chance.

Maybe it’s the fact that I’ve just now started to try and read it at 18 and not when I was a kid. Maybe it’s more of a nostalgia thing?

My name is David Peterson, and I create languages for movies and television shows (Game of Thrones, Defiance, The 100, Dominion, Thor: The Dark World, Star-Crossed, Penny Dreadful, Emerald City). I recently published a book called The Art of Language Invention about creating a language. I can’t say anything about season 6 for Game of Thrones, season 3 of The 100, or anything else regarding work that hasn’t been aired yet, but I’ll try to answer everything else. I’ll be back around 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET to answer questions, and I’ll probably keep at it throughout the day.

**10:41 a.m. PDT**: I'm here now and answering questions. Will keep doing so till 11:30 when I have an interview, and then I'll come back when it's done. Incidentally, anything you want me to say in the interview? They ask questions, of course, but I can always add something and see if they print it. :)

**11:32 a.m. PDT**: Doing my interview now with Modern Notion. Be like 30 minutes.

**12:06 p.m. PDT**: I'm back, baby!

**3:07 p.m. PDT**: Okay, I've got to get going, but thank you so much for the questions!

18js1n6,I will never be able to read A Game of Thrones…,"For now.

After watching the entire show, I have planned on reading the books for years. I finally had time to start the journey and I can’t do it. First of all I got to a point where I could only read about fifty pages a day because it was so depressing that it was actually making me sad and angry to read it. I got about 3/4 of the way and realized I was never going to finish this book, nor was I going to read the sequels. I think had i picked up this series before the show aired i would have loved them. But as it stands, because I know the major beats of the story, I am just miserable the whole time waiting for all the awful things I know are going to happen. There is no surprise anymore, no shock when there is a betrayal or a death. Yes the books are not exactly the same as the show and they diverge at a certain point but I just can’t do it. I can’t read a book that makes me dread opening it just to say I did. It is well written, and compelling, but I think it’s time to return it to the library for someone who will actually enjoy reading it.

Edit: the lack of surprise is not from having seen the show, it’s from knowing at any point someone you’ve enjoyed reading about is going to die, or do something horrible to someone else. It’s exhausting to read about horrific things over and over and over ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18js1n6/i_will_never_be_able_to_read_a_game_of_thrones/,2023-12-16T14:12:32Z,159,0,books,Game Of Thrones,POST

101hbl2,Game of Thrones 9999,"So, I've watched the HBO series, finally, and am midway through the 5th book.  That's something like 4500 pages, all told.

Martin really seems to like gore, torture, and misery, because there's so much of it in the whole story.  Times of lightness and humor are few and far between.  Times of justice, after long spells of injustice, are also scarce.

Well, being this close to the end, I have to finish it.  But, given the unrelenting misery of the whole thing, I can't see why I should recommend it to anybody.

The best things about it, IMHO, are the world-building and the characters.  But, I would not have wanted to live in that world, or have lived through what any of the characters lived through.  Oh, and the manipulations, intrigue, strategies so many of the characters engage in is interesting and involving.

EDIT:

Ok, I've been unfair about the whole thing, because the horrible parts are *really* horrible.  The Boltons, Ramsay, in particular, is a true piece of work.  Horrible enough that I let it affect my thinking about the whole series and the show.

But, there are characters that are kind, decent, good people.  Humor isn't Martin's forte, at least as this series is written, but there are scenes and situations that are wonderful.

vwko34,Game of Thrones - Review,"Whenever I consider what makes a good book, I tend to reflect on how impressionable the first read was. How connected I felt with the characters and the world built around them, as well as if the book felt long while reading, or if it just looked like a long read from the size. As a reader, I believe if a book ever feels long in certain aspects, something is lacking, something isn’t keeping my attention or drawing me into the words I’m reading. However, George R.R. Martin may have written one of the longest/shortest books I’ve read so far, but I can confidently say I’ll be diving into the next one soon enough. 

One thing Martin, as well as many other creators do so well while writing, is building their world and characters from a blank template. Martin had a vision, and he delivered every little aspect from it. Meaning, Martin doesn’t want the reader to miss out on anything this world has to offer, he wants you to smell the wet grass in this environment, the smoke from every battle, to listen to every piece of dialogue no matter how little the impact may be. Martin wanted the reader to walk through this dark, gritty time period, and experience the pieces of fiction to compliment the realistic approach to other subjects among this novel. 

Game of Thrones is most referred to being in comparison to the 15th century, tackling that medieval itch so many fantasy lovers have. Gritty indeed this novel is, subjects such as slavery, violence on women, and even pedophilia… and that’s just a few examples. However, while reading I never felt like these things were thrown in the novel to add shock value; I never felt what I was reading took me away from the book. I would argue, a lot of these touchy subjects were more prominent during this time period, however (of course) it doesn’t make it correct. As stated previously, Martin wants you to walk through these treacherous grounds, that so many authors today shy away from. Martin creates characters, but me as the reader had this internal conflict of loving them, but hating certain things they do. Which, brownie points to Martin for delivering on such a challenging concept. 

While reading this book, it seems as if Martin wants to hold your hand, but shy’s away from it and realizes he wants you to experience this for yourself. What I mean by that, is certain chapters he’ll pull you back into a specific character, then let’s go so the reader can comprehend what’s occurring with this chapter. 

To conclude, I think it’s very evident from the beginning of this novel if you’ll love it or hate it. I mean, isn’t that almost always the case with classics anyways..? Furthermore, I will finally take that step to join the huge percentage of the population that has watched the show, and I’m excited to read into the next installment of the series.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vwko34/game_of_thrones_review/,2022-07-11T15:08:57Z,18,6,books,Game Of Thrones,POST

47s98u,How good are the Game of Thrones books?,"First of all I am not a big fan of the show I find it to be a weird crossover between Spartacus and Lord of the Rings. I feel the plot advancement is a bit rushed too, at least in the first seasons since sometimes conflicts would be solved very drastically, with killings, using some-sort of device or magic or just following someone's advice all of the sudden. 

I also felt that  it is not very clear how magical is the universe sometimes they resort to it, sometimes they don't and your left wondering why and sometimes it solves everything.

However, I am fan of the medieval set-ups and fantasy in general, and I do recognise that the representation of those times with flawed and power hungry Lords is actually a much more accurate representation of the era. 

So I would appreciate an honest review of the books, I believe they have the ingredients for me to enjoy them, but the show kinda killed it for me. Plus it is very hard to find a legitimate review, since the people I know either love them or just don't care about that type of setting

I’ve never encountered a book where there’s so many characters, so many histories and so many sub plots. I’m only at page about 120, and I’m wondering if it’s worth to keep reading. I do like it so far but I feel I don’t really quite understand who all these characters are/can’t remember what house they belong to or who is a brother or sister of who.

That was definitely not the case.

While I initially didn't care much for the first few pages, I quickly found myself growing attached to the characters, and realized how fleshed out they were. I could almost feel their struggles and the weight of their decisions, and I was quickly pulled into the world of Westeros. I felt burdened alongside Ned and his choices, and ostracized with Jon, and laughed at Tryon and his wit. I wanted to give Sansa a hug, and wanted to slap the shit out of Joffrey, and then kick Joffrey. And then hit him again god damn it I HATE JOFFREY...

4qefq4,The french saga that inspired Game of Thrones,"I am french and I know there is some love here for ""Le comte de Monté-Cristo"", which is a great novel. But there is a saga that I recommend you to read dearly: ""Les rois maudits"" (""The accursed Kings"") from Maurice Druon.
The reason I am posting this is that I just finished to read this historical novel (7 novels) for maybe the 8th time. This is a fantastic and gripping reading.
This is an historical saga. The story starts from the trial of the templars and describes the capetian dinasty. The serie is historically accurate although some points are disputed amongst historian but this is not a history book since it is romanced. My english is not very good so it's hard to me how to describe the amazing serie but think of it as Game of Thrones transposed in the real world with, IMO, much more intensity since the facts are real. You will learn for example that the Hundred years war was originally caused by unfaithful wives. You see how the daily life of powerful people affects whole nations.
This serie is brutal, raw, beautifully written, not boring a single second, and so surprising. Sometimes I had to put down the book thinking ""No, Druon made it up, that couldn't have happened"", I check on wiki the events he is talking about and yes, this stunning event did really happen !

Anyway, Martin about the Accursed Kings:

e5bnil,"The amazing series the Wheel of time is, and it's many similarities to Game of Thrones!","When I first read the series of A Song of Ice and fire, I couldn't get enough. I was addicted. It was like book crack!

 I'm a slow reader as I like to dissect the content and really take in the detail, and this sometimes can take me a little while, specially as English is not my mother tongue. 
However the level of highly descriptive content I found, rich narrative, story telling and lore instantly hooked me.  It's an incredible universe with incredible characters that have been intricately weaved together.

Alas, my disappointment as I desperately waited and waited ( as I'm sure many of you have) for the next book(s) in the series for these never to materialise.

However this story has a happy ending after all. I was recommended the Wheel of Time series, and even though I'm only on book 4 so far, I couldn't be happier with what I've found!!!

I feel reinvigorated by the books, and they have really fulfilled the empty space GoT left.

I'm incredibly amazed at the similarities; surely GRRM must have taken a lot of inspiration from it.

I believe the story telling has a similar pace, it's incredibly rich in lore and context, and both universes are similarly well put together. So many races and lands. Sometimes as I read it almost feels like it's the same universe.

Aside from this I don't want to ruin it for anybody else, but there are major similarities: the 'Game of houses' (!),  the wolves, and maybe I'm looking too hard into it; but I also feel that the fight between ice and fire often feels like the fight between light and dark within the WoT.

All in all, couldn't be happier with the series so far and I feel that any avid fan of a Song of Ice and Fire should certainly read it too! Specially if you've been suffering from major withdrawal symptoms like I was facing. 
On a positive note I'm also a massive fan of Brandon Sanderson! I've just found out he helped Robert Jordan finish the series!

Have you read the WoT? Or are you also in the process? How awesome is it!
And yes I'm aware its been out since forever so this is probably old news!

TLDR: started reading The Wheel of Time after giving up on any further books on The Song of Ice and Fire being written.

Since GOT I have read the Enders series, started the Wheel of Time series (gave up), Hunger Games (don't ask), The Magician series, The Mistborne series (terrible), a few Culture novels and The Name of the Wind books which I enjoyed as well as plenty of non-fiction books not worth mentioning.

What I really like about GOT is the depth of the characters, the overarching plot (although it has lost its way), the history of the world, the mature themes and of course his writing style. 

Can anyone point me towards something that is going to fulfil my craving?

I have used the NPR Fantasy/SciFi flowchart but I find it doesn't really help with the SciFi side.

1jphet,Question about Game of Thrones,"I'm about to begin the last Game of Thrones book and it occurs to me, there's no single main plot line. Basically, it seems to me that there are a huge number of threads, all weaving together to form the overall tapestry of the story. 

So my question is this - do you think this is a type of series that could just continue indefinitely as long as the author keeps writing? The world George R.R. Martin has created has huge scope for new characters and it would be pretty interesting to see previously lower status Houses become increasingly influential while the current crop of powerful houses (Lannisters/Tyrells) become a shadow of their former selves. 

**TL;DR:** Can you see any scenario in which the GoT series could be said to be concluded? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jphet/question_about_game_of_thrones/,2013-08-04T23:43:23Z,21,3,books,Game Of Thrones,POST
x4njxo,"The Moontide Quartet - Almost a Game of Thrones rival, held back by inconsistent characters and plot contrivances.","The book series Moontide Quartet is very very close to being good. 

For the most part I enjoyed the series, which is why it is even more annoying that the problems keep piling. A mug with a small crack can still hold water but if the cracks are everywhere it starts leaking. 

Major spoilers going forward so if you are interested stop. 

It starts with stuff that is core to the books world: the tide bridge. It is made out to be the most important thing in the world that everything revolves around, yet there are airships right from the start that do kinda ruin it. If the empire really really wanted to, they could just send non stop soldiers over with air ships, which is basically what they did at some point anyway. So really the main plot of making the tide bridge permanent is nonsense. 

But the real core problem of the story is this: the love stories. Or rather the characters and their interactions. 

Easiest example is Kazim. At first he is so madly in love with Ramita that he stalks down the grand magus and kills him to finally free her and be with her. Then when she tells him to go away cause he killed her husband (that she grew to love maybe 3 or 4 pages before that point), he doesn't spend a single sentence being sad or heartbroken. Instead he is too busy doing magic at that point. And later on he and Elana get super stockholm syndrom when he tries to kill her and she imprisons him for 6 months. And then they have most purest loving relationship that even transcends magic and reality! Its not good.

Not much better is Alaron and Cym. From the start Cym tells Alan that she's not interested in him and wants ""a man like a lion"". Alan is still pursuing her, stalker style, and even rescues her from tribal men that captured her, where she again tells him to sod off. Which if it ended there might have been funny, but after that the entire story around Cym starts to torture her for not siding Alan. She finally does get her ""man like a lion"" in the form of a shapeshifter that kills mages to sustain himself. The 2 also get stockholm syndrom love (notice a trend?) but not really. For one she gets an abortion to get rid of his child, and secondly the magic symbiosis Kazim got with Elena never happens between them. The longer you read Cyms story the more it reads like someone who got rejected in the past and is now having revenge on this character they created. That is ofc just speculation but it certainly feels that way reading it. 

And I am going to not even mention the Lesbian princess that is forced into a violent marriage (I think its a fetish at this point). 

So yeah. That certainly held the books back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/x4njxo/the_moontide_quartet_almost_a_game_of_thrones/,2022-09-03T06:30:33Z,0,7,books,Game Of Thrones,POST
b4xlfx,Do all the A Game of Thrones books follow the same pattern?,"So more than half throught the first book I hesitate to carry on reading the series. The many small plots here and there are interesting but the thing is the book take way too much time to get to the point and for some characters we even get nowhere. Almost 90% of each chapter is characters talking and repeating themselves. I'm a bit tired of hearing over and over that Jon Snow is a bastard or how this family did this or how the Targaryens fell. Before getting to some action or something interesting the author also contantly add sex scenes and random violence that I don't really get sometimes like when Arya's friend get cut in pieces or the Dothraki. It's not that I've never red books with violence it's just that in this book it feels way too random. Last thing I have to mention is how each chapter follow a different character (half of them a very boring) and it breaks the story so abrubtly I got lost sometimes and I have to come back to a chapter to remember what a character did which I think works for a tv series but it's horrible for a book.

&#x200B;

My question is are all the GoT books like this or does the author change his way of writting at some point and also do we get to something more original at some point?

1vkn8i,game of thrones advice,"Hey everyone,

I was wondering if you could help me with something in regards to the game of thrones series.

I read the first book in the series and thought it was good but not great. I've been told that the TV is excellent and possibly even more enjoyable than the book. This is supplemented by the fact that I've heard that the 2nd, 4th and 5th book are relatively meh. However, the 3rd book is supposed to be spectacular.

Do you think it makes sense for me to watch the 2nd season of the tv show and then read the third book? or should I just stick to one medium (either the books or tv show).

Thanks for the advice.

Book 1 was not good enough to keep me reading the series. It is solely because I have heard such amazing things about book 3 that I entertaining the idea of reading more of the books.

4gjd0u,Anyone think Stephen King might be a suitable author to finish ASOIAF (Game of Thrones) if George RR Martin dies before finishing it?,"I've seen people suggest various fantasy authors, but really... none of them seem right to me. Martin's version of fantasy lacks the lighthearted-magical-wonder-kid-adventure feel that most fantasy books have. It's very gritty and bloody and rapey and brutal. 

It also has dialogue that feels fairly real, and not too... I dunno... contrived to sound more fantasy and heroic-ish?

We need an author who can have their character scream ""FUCK"" and not ""by Shemak's balls!"". There can be nothing cutesy like that. Funny is ok, cutesy is not. And there's gotta be that famous willingness to kill off any character at any time, and not shy away from gore and torture and incestuous sex scenes.

I feel like King has that right blend of realism, the horrific, and that ability to plan complex plots and write multi-thousand page epics. He's definitely watching the show, dunno if he's read the books. 

He's got a renewed interest in fantasy with his recent dark tower movie adaptation, and possible TV series. I remember him saying the series was complete and then he added a book in 2012.

3ctvc4,"Question about ""A Game of Thrones"", possible spoilers...","Good Morning books!

I have a question about something that happens in the first ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" book that I have a question about.

Now I am listening to the audiobook, narrated by the incredible Roy Dotrice, during my hour-long commute to and from work over my car's stereo, so I guess it's possible I miss a bit of something happens on the road and pulls what little attention the book/reading requires.

On the King's Road as [Ned, Arya, Sansa and the King's company](#s) are traveling to King's Landing. There is a point where [Joffery attacks Arya](#s) and [Nymeria defends her attacking Joffery](#s) at this time [Arya forces Nymeria to run away](#s) then a little later [King Robert holds a judgement where Cerci wants the Dire wolf dead, with Nymeria loose in the wild they kill Lady in her place.](#s)

I am pretty clear on all that...this next part is where I am confused.

[John Snow, while the others are traveling to King's Landing goes to the wall to take the black and be a brother of the Night's Watch.](#s)

Later, way after he [takes the oath, and dons the black; he attacks Alastair Thorne when Ned is accused of being a traitor. Everyone assumes that Sansa and Arya are locked up as well.](#s)

John Snow [gets locked up with Ghost as punishment, before the White walker attacks Maester Aemon](#s), and he says a line that confused me to no end, he says something to effect of, [""...at least I have Ghost, my sister's don't have that luxury...""](#s)

When would have found out? How could he know? [Ned, Arya, and Sansa](#s) were all traveling when it happened, could they have sent a crow while on the road? This seems like such a small thing to send a crow to John about anyway. Did [Tyrion Lannister tell John what happened when he visited?](#s) Was he even with [the King's troupe](#s) while they were traveling?

2bae2m,Game of Thrones: Going from Series to Book!,"Hi everyone
First of all.. I'm brand new to Reddit. I have a rather odd request.. I hope you'll take your time to read this :)
I'm basically looking to continue GoT with the books, having seen just the 4 current seasons. My question then is, for those have read the books AND watched the show. Which book would you start out with if you were gonna continue? I'm not looking to start from scratch.. I want to continue the story, not read a lot that i've already seen. I am also aware that the show isn't doing the book directly but changing some, pushing some story lines while bringing some in earlier..
Sorry for the wall of text! 

TL;DR
Which book should i read to continue GoT from the tv show?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2bae2m/game_of_thrones_going_from_series_to_book/,2014-07-21T12:00:27Z,19,2,books,Game Of Thrones,POST
4lyq5o,Dance of Dragons (Game of Thrones) Question,"So I've been plowing through the A Song of Fire and Ice series (Game of Thrones) and I'm finally on a Dance with Dragons (Book V).
I've been listening to them mostly on audio book through my local/state library on my phone, but recently I went to my library and borrowed the book.
But when I did, it came as two separate books, both equally thick and together double the size of the normal versions I've seen.
The first is a Dance with Dragons: Part 1. Dust and Dreams and the second is Dance with Dragons: Part 2. After the Feast.
I'm almost finished with the first and will hopefully be starting the second soon.

Anyways, here's my question. Why is this edition split up into two parts?? Is it an extended edition? Or is there some other reason? The print doesn't seem to be any bigger, and it doesn't include any parts from the other books, so I don't understand why there's such a difference between these copies (the only one's I've seen like it) and the ones I've been finding in book stores. And googling it hasn't turned up anything.

Any help would be appreciated greatly!
Thanks,
-Jmanorama

6haqmh,Is it worth reading the last two Game of Thrones books?,"I recently (finally) finished the third book in the Song of Ice of Fire Series, A Storm of Swords. I've seen some rankings of all the books, and this book is always either at the top or right near it, and I have to agree. It's definitely my favorite out of the three I've read, and if the other two books were on par with this one, I'd be more inclined to read them.

However, I've heard from multiple people, both on the internet and in person, that the next two books in the series definitely drop in quality, with plot arcs that don't go anywhere and chapters where nothing happens. Already, I feel the books are perhaps more descriptive than they need to be, but Martin's stories and characters and settings make it worth reading through paragraphs of what kind of specific armor a character is wearing. However, if I had to go through another two books of that, with plots that don't really go anywhere anyway, I'm not sure if it's worth it. One of my friends says he wouldn't have spent the time reading them if he had known how boring they were, and suggests that just read plot summaries of the characters I care about online. Is this worth doing? Technically, I have been reading these books for about two and a half years. Now, I'm already a slow reader, and I took long breaks sometimes, and I would read books in between, but still. I have still not seen the show, and my friend also says that they show went in a better direction regarding the plot. Is it worth reading two more of these books, or if they really are that boring in comparison, would I be better off passing them up? 

Lastly I wanted to give an analysis of the book and what I thought and what I would like to see continued, as well as what I've heard doesn't really go anywhere in the following books, so spoilers from here. One character who I've heard has a boring plot arc is Brienne. We left her going after Sansa at the request of Jaime (who, by the way, had an amazing arc throughout the book with awesome character development). I don't actually know what becomes of this quest, but from what I've heard, it's relatively boring. I've also heard the Tyrell's become more of plot point, I believe. My friend said that the books used to be about the good guys, Starks, vs the bad guys, the Lannisters. Of course, there was more going on, but that was kind of the broad gist of it. But now there's so many side stories and arcs that it kind of becomes too much. Arya ended the book getting on a boat to somewhere. Braavos maybe? Jon Snow is now Lord Commander of the Wall. Catelyn is somehow alive again, evidently. Daenerys is going to try to rule Mereen and train her dragons. And I believe someone told me that time travel eventually becomes a plot point. All these things sound really cool and I want to follow up on them, but if I have to sit through boring chapters where nothing happens, I'm not sure if it's worth it. Furthermore, I do know that Dany is *still* in Essos at the end of the fifth book. Or at least not in Westeros. What?! I'm sure she still does interesting stuff, but her whole point is to eventually get to Westeros and she still hasn't done that? That's just something that surprised me.

One final thing, on criticism of the books that I'm not sure is warranted, but something I noticed. The maps of the known world still don't have everything discovered, and Martin did a great job of inciting that sense of exploration and wonder that we don't really get anymore, but that people in the middle ages must've got all the time. If you go west of Westeros, what's over there?! Are there really giant ape men in Sothoryos? What's in Ulthos? And this is a fantasy world so anything goes. One thing that got me excited was wondering if there really were giants. They're talked about like they're myths, with some characters claiming they've seen them, but you don't know for sure if they're still around. Before someone spoiled it for me and told me that they are in the show, I was kept wondering if we'd ever actually see any. Then Jon finally does... and he's like, ""Neat."" The same thing for the skinchangers. Bran is pretty comfortable getting into Summer's and even Hodor's skin at this point, pretty easily. And Arya and and Jon can sort of do it to. And there's a guy in Mance Rayder's group that can do it to. The books were largely about who would sit the Iron Throne. More of a medieval book than a fantasy one, with a few fantasy thing sprinkled in. But then the fantasy things start happening, but none of the characters seem impressed by it. Jon nor any of the other members of the Night's Watched seemed remotely impressed or awed that Giants do actually still exist. And that there are mammoths beyond the wall. And that skinchanging is an actual thing. Jon sees the guy in Mance's party and even experiences it a bit himself, but doesn't seem remotely alarmed or impressed. He's kind of indifferent. Bran was impressed and apprehensive at first, but he very quickly became comfortable with it. With maesters saying that none of this is real, you would think the characters would believe that, but they seem pretty unimpressed when it they actually see it. And it makes me thing that if they don't care, why should I? I might be wrong in that analysis, and I'd love to hear a counterargument, but that's how I took it.

Anyway, I'd still like to know if it's worth reading, the last two books. If you read this far in my post, thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6haqmh/is_it_worth_reading_the_last_two_game_of_thrones/,2017-06-14T21:51:46Z,17,4,books,Game Of Thrones,POST

c7dk45,"A ""children's book"" fans of Game of Thrones will most definitely enjoy.","So recently at work we had a children's book sale in the mall's courtyard. The books were dirt cheap ($2-$5 approximately with staff discount) and about 5-10$ for box sets!) I picked up an appealing middle grade fantasy series called ""The Crown of Three"" by J. D. Rinehart. After checking reviews it seems that the series isn't well known, so I thought I'd offer some thoughts on this fantastic trilogy.

A prophecy predicts that when three new stars appear in the sky, triplets will be born to the mistress of King Brutan who will kill their father and end his reign. He catches wind of the prophecy and attempts to go to kill his children, but the wizard Melchior makes it appear as if the children are stillborn so the King laughs at his mistress and leaves.

Flash forward 10 years when the children are 13 years old and separated from each other, each placed in the care of various foster parents.

Gulph was sold by his foster parent for a barrel of ale to a circus, who are now his family. He's a great performer who is frowned upon by people and called a freak because of his ability to fit his body in small places by popping out his arm from its socket etc. 

Tarlan, my favourite, was with his foster father when they were overwhelmed by Elksman who kill all people not their  and even eat them later. He is raised by a witch in the woods and has some handy giant eagle friends (who interestingly enough don't have a role as a deus ex machina but mortality, grief and a bitter understanding of humans). Tarlan can speak to animals and uses his ability so cleverly that I was often left dumbfounded by the intelligent battles in the book.

 The last triplet, Elodie, was raised with one of King Brutan's lords and has lived a life not unlike Sansa's - filled with naivete. She slowly realizes and grows to maturity, realizing her foster father is equally as deranged and sick as her father. She is the only triplet who knows she is a part of the prophecy.

Take three characters who are destined to belong together to take in the kingdom, add some twists on a prophecy, include characters who think about their life and those of others (in a manner which constantly changes according to their experience) and add a dash, realism of war of horror and death (always done in a way that is applicable and not gratuitous) and bam, you have one of my top ten favorite fantasy series.

I find this book fascinating because it has been written for 9-12 year olds, but is infinitely more intelligent than a young adult novel and many adult fantasies I've read. The characters are well fleshed out but morally grey , despite only being 13. The violence and descriptions are overwhelming in a thoughtful way, including deaths of beloved friends, amputation, child slavery and even rape. This book does not read as a children's book, but doesn't read as an adult book either. Simply put, it does not feel as if it were written for no audience in mind, but all of them who wish to see how children would react when friends die, a kingdom is at stake and when they are bereft of their childhoods. 

This series is a fantasy horror with thriller elements that is simply marvelous - I've enjoyed it thoroughly and feel that the end is extremely satisfying. I really recommend it to all who lvoe fantasy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c7dk45/a_childrens_book_fans_of_game_of_thrones_will/,2019-06-30T13:14:49Z,2,0,books,Game Of Thrones,POST

1. Why did the witch perform the ritual as she died? She said not long before that she purposefully had done it before as an act of revenge, essentially killing Danys baby in the process. Now she's being put to fire by Dany and chooses to help her?

2. Drago returned entirely brain dead, why aren't the dragons?

bru4m0,"Now that the Game of Thrones is over, What book or book series you guys think will make an even better epic fantasy when adapted to television and why? (Think about TV episodic terms and also take into account the regular audience)","My choice is already being made into a TV show and I'm hella excited. 

The Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss. 

I loved ASOIAF but when i read this one I was enchanted. I couldn't think of anything for weeks. Rothfuss is a genius. It has political intrigue, hero's journey, action, comedy, complex characters, and an awesome fantasy world. It is a story about Kvothe, a smart, never lose faith, up for anything, orphan who gains admission into a prestigious university where he becomes an infamous figure in the span of the book (Not a spoiler).

The reason i think it would work as a TV show is that the journey of Kvothe is filled with small adventures, and recurring characters. Everyone of those can make an episode. Kvothe isn't tied to honesty, or idealism, but knows when to take the right decision. This makes him a very complex and fun protagonist that doesn't go stale over different seasons. It is also a mystery with a lot of fantastical elements that can keep the viewers excited for the next episode. The main thing is, the magic and fantastical elements are secondary to the story of Kvothe. He is a regular boy, who has to struggle all his life to get what he needs either by hook or crook. 

There is one similar problem to GOT that the third book is yet to release and the writer is suffering from GRRM syndrome. So fingers crossed. 

It also has music as Kvothe is also a musician and when I read that Lin Manuel Miranda is heading project i got very excited. Its a perfect fit.

bj8hyn,"So, I'm caving on Game of Thrones and am going to watch the show. (No spoilers please)","I first read A Game of Thrones back in 99,and have been an avid and patient fan ever since. I rejoiced when I heard they were making a show. I was thrilled that so many people I had tried to turn on to the books were finally experiencing one of my favorite series'. I loved that GRRM was getting broad cultural recognition. I watched every episode...

Until the show caught up to the books.

Now, I've been relegated to staying off social media and walking out of the room when people are taking about the show. I'm growing to hate that the show was ever made.

For me, the books are first. The world is bigger. The characters are more vibrant. The story is richer. I want to experience the book first.

But this show is so big that it's impossible. I've already had some things spoiled.

It's like Harry Potter. I saw the first movie before I read the books, so I went into them with an idea of what the world looked like. I still loved the books, but my experience was always influenced by the movie. I prefer to go into a book with a blank slate. 

I think it's time that I recognize I will never be able to experience the story in the way I had hoped, twenty years ago.

It's very bittersweet. I'm glad I'll soon find out what happens, but disappointed I'll have to wait h the show first. Anyone else in the same boat?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bj8hyn/so_im_caving_on_game_of_thrones_and_am_going_to/,2019-04-30T20:54:49Z,13,0,books,Game Of Thrones,POST

nhaem,I am the opposite: I just finished reading Game of Thrones and have NOT seen the HBO series. What should I do? (spoilers),"On one hand I could go watch the series, on the other I could continue on with Clash of Kings. 

I actually do like sometimes seeing a movie/show of a book before reading it because I like having a mental picture of what characters look and sound like. It helps a little in distinguishing them from other characters, and I don't struggle trying to decide in my mind what they look like, I just know. For example I knew from just seeing ads and reddit posts what Tyrion looks like and I think the kneeling ""winter/reposts/downvotes are coming"" guy is Ned, but I have no idea what Robert, Robb, the Stark daughters, etc. look like. To me, Robb, Bran, Jon, Joffrey, all had the same generic look in my head of ""Young Boy.""

One thing I have loved about this book so far is that other than the medievaly setting, there is really not much that is fantasy/supernatural. Most of it has been political conflict. With two major exceptions, the wights and the dragons. The wights appear once in the prologue, and again in a Jon chapter (and by that point I had more or less forgotten the prologue), but having finished the book you know more of them is coming. The dragons are talked about throughout the book, but when Dany hatches the eggs at the very end you are left thinking ""oh shit, so this is a real thing."" Other books I could easily see going into this all right away ""zomg! look, dragons and ghosts!""

The ending is very much a cliff hanger, the last 3 chapters clearly setting up the next book. I'm not really sure I like this, it doesn't seem to me like anything was resolved in the book. But I suppose you need to end the book somewhere, or (assuming the other books are like this) just have one 7,000 page book. 

Anyway! Next book, or watch the series?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nhaem/i_am_the_opposite_i_just_finished_reading_game_of/,2011-12-18T12:47:32Z,45,40,books,Game Of Thrones,POST

718ev4,Three Body Problem got me to thinking about the weather in Game of Thrones,"In Three Body Problem, there is a civilization that exists on a planet that orbits three stars.

I was watching the first episode of season 2 of Game of Thrones and there is a red comet in the sky. In the same episode it is declared that the 5 year summer has come to an end, and some expect an equally long winter. Their weather patterns, like the Trisolarans, are unpredictable. 

I was initially writing this post to see others opinion on the world of ASOIAF and the weather patterns, if anyone knew if it might be scientifically possible. Then I realized I could just google it. I found this:

cogr57,"Just finished ""A Game of Thrones"", after not fully reading a book for 5 years - and WOW!","It had been almost 5 years since I've read a book longer than 100 pages start to end. In my childhood days I'd been completely absorbed by fantasy and fiction novels of all sorts, yet in my recent years I'd been trying to get into educational/non-fiction/self-help books as I thought that this type of reading is what I need to become a fulfilled and open-minded adult. This was all, however, counterintuitive as I could never bring myself to finish any of these books which I just could not find myself engaged in. 

So when I decided to give fantasy another go, it only made sense to go with GRRM's epic series. Despite it seeming like a daunting task of reading a 780 page book, I thought I'd just read a couple of a hundred pages and see where it goes -never expecting to actually make it through the whole thing. Cue 2 months later (with a 400 page binge in 3 days), and here I am finished with book 1 - and my god! 

Martin's world feels so alive, the characters so real, and the emotions so raw. I was filled with thrill and excitement as the world slowly unfolded and we're given small pieces of information about the world's history and lore. Despite knowing what was coming having watched the TV show, I still found myself eager to know what comes next, and to get a deeper insight into how these events resonated with these characters. 

What I've discovered is that I've not lost the love I had for reading that I had as a child, I had just stopped reading the books I enjoyed reading. And now I'm eagerly awaiting for my copies of A Clash of King and A Storm of Swords to arrive as I caery on this epic journey!

4p2q7p,"A counter argument: Why the Game of Thrones show has made me so much more hopeful for the book [Spoilers for ASOIAF, Game of Thrones, and Sword of Truth]","One of the major differentiating factor about *A Game of Thrones* as a novel and A Song of Ice and Fire as a series is the sense of finality. It is often hard to be worried about the main character of a fantasy novel since they are almost always protected by some deus-ex-machina plot device that pull them from danger at the last moment. The Sword of Truth series is a perfect example of this, where the reader sees a character literally decapitated until suddenly (surprise!) there is an extremely powerful spell that renders that whole struggle obsolete. In a Song of Ice and Fire, however, when a character dies, they stay dead. Mess up in Westeros, and pay the price.

In the past season, the show has almost wholly abandoned this gravity. Viewers saw it when Arya was stabbed by the Waif, and again when the knight of the Vale miraculously showed up at the perfect moments of the Bastard-bowl, bailing Jon out of what had been an extremely reckless and ll-fated decision.

i hope, and I pray, that the books will feature a return to form for Martin. It would be extremely easy to have had the Littlefinger's men show up before the battle, especially with the depiction in ASOIAF of Ramsey's troops being half starved and frozen during the winter. I recognize that more epic battle makes for better television, but as a reader I think the more psychological elements of the Jon, Arya, and in many ways the Jaime story lines have been obscured. I hold out hope that the books will be able to take us into the twisted world of Westeros, where the greatest beasts are not dragons but men themselves",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4p2q7p/a_counter_argument_why_the_game_of_thrones_show/,2016-06-21T03:55:10Z,3,11,books,Game Of Thrones,POST

ryeord,Harry Potter character: Cho Chang,"The discussion of JK Rowling naming the only East Asian character Cho Chang has recently resurfaced on my twitter timeline, and people seem to be angry at this representation of a Chinese girl. 

HOWEVER, I am a Chinese girl with a Chinese name - I grew up in England, and my sister and I were the only Chinese kids at our school. Cho Chang was the first Chinese character I encountered whilst reading. I felt seen. Her name, and even the fact that she was the only Chinese girl (that I knew of) at Hogwarts, resonated with me. I also think this reflects the time in which JK Rowling wrote the books: there just wasn’t as many Chinese people in the country as there are now.

193nk8o,How does Harry Potter work for kids nowadays?,"One of the things I've always found the most interesting about the *Harry Potter* series (and I think one of the reasons it's had so much success) is that each successive book feels like it's aimed at a slightly higher age group. *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* is definitely a children's book, and I wouldn't say that *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* is. For the original generation of readers, this worked out well because we grew up with the characters.

I was eight when I read the first *Harry Potter* book. Within a year I'd read all four of the books that were out at that time, really enjoying the first three but struggling a lot more with the fourth. *Goblet of Fire* was just a bit more dark and complex than I was quite ready for at that point (although when I got older that became my favourite one). For the rest of the books I just had to wait until they came out - and this was a good thing, because in the time in between the release of each new book, I'd gained the maturity to be able to appreciate it when it happened, and in the meantime I could re-read the previous ones and make sure I fully understood them. I was thirteen at the time *Deathly Hallows* came out.

How do kids read them nowadays? What age group do they tend to be recommended to, and do kids lose a bit in the process? I can't imagine having read them all for the first time at any one specific point in my childhood - by the time I was old enough to fully appreciate *Deathly Hallows*, I'd have already outgrown *Philosopher's Stone*.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just to be clear, I believe that JK Rowling has expressed some extremely damaging views that have caused great harm particularly to the transgender community (and from what I've heard have potentially even prompted some suicides). Although I still enjoy her books and feel I've grown and learned some moral lessons from them, the fact that she's done this is something I've found very upsetting.

vkuykd,Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was published 25 years ago today,"The book would eventually go on to be the [third best selling book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books#List_of_best-selling_individual_books) of all time. It was also the first in a series of books that would go on to become the [best selling book series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books#List_of_best-selling_book_series) of all time.

The story follows an orphan living at his aunt and uncle’s home who is neglected and mistreated. Later, he is invited to enroll at Hogwarts a school for witchcraft and wizardry. His life changes dramatically when he joins.

The series ignited the spark to read for many young readers that would become a habit, despite the author, J.K. Rowling, becoming a controversial figure recently.

For me, it accelerated my ability to read longer books because the next one in the series was usually longer than the one before it. Before that, I was reading the Goosebumps series as an primary/elementary school student, which were much shorter. The characters were funny and relatable and the plot was interesting and unpredictable.

anvgqg,First time through Harry Potter at 25,"I just finished book one, the Sorcerer’s Stone. 

Having never seen the movies, I have to say this book was very imaginative and creative. Some of my favorite parts were just things like the painting of the lady as an entrance to the Gryffindor house and how the lady can move and talk. All of the characters have unique personalities and I was able to create an image in my head of what they would be like just from the descriptions JK Rowling gives. Not to mention, there is quite a bit of humor throughout and I caught myself smiling and/or laughing throughout. The first book was charming and I’m looking forward to the rest of the series. I really can see how they are such hits and modern day children’s classics!

Not sure I have a main discussion focus, but is anyone else like me and had never read the books growing up? IMO they’re not so juvenile that an adult can’t enjoy them!

EDIT: Ok, not very far into book 2, but to my point in the original post about humor, there are already some things that I have gotten a kick out of. First is when Aunt Petunia keeps ogling over Dudley and how he is just the best boy ever - she thinks the Masons will just absolutely love him. And second is when Harry is sitting on the garden bench and scares Dudley by saying silly magic words. I just find both of those segments hilarious. They actually made me chuckle... out loud.

17l3e3w,"Growing up, I’ve kinda realized a lot of the Harry Potter characters are kinda shitty people","This isn’t even an attack on JK Rowling. It’s just looking back on it, there are a lot of deeply flawed characters in HP. And I’m mainly thinking of the adults.

Snape is the obvious one, even if he’s technically on the good side. But James Potter was also an arrogant bully, just a charismatic and intelligent one.

Lupin was my favorite DADA teacher and top 5 characters overall, but his struggles in the later books leading him to almost abandon his wife and child due to his insecurity really rubbed me the wrong way. Of course Harry knocked some sense into him, and he did go back and tend to his family, but it permanently left a bad taste in my mouth.

Sirius was cool as hell, and was a very loving uncle/godfather to Harry. But he also mistreated Kreacher which partly led to his demise. I guess the “norm” in the wizard world was that house elves were practically slaves so it was considered “normal behavior”, but his brother Regulus was able to overcome that pretty well.

Dumbledore’s the obvious big target. He knew that Harry was a Horcrux, but still led him on the whole way through. And the whole sending Harry back to the Dursleys thing, even if Lily’s charm only worked then, he still visited the Weasley’s just fine. And of course his past with his family and Grindewald and all. A LOT has been discussed around the big D, I won’t bring up everything else.

There are others, like the two wizard presidents, flawed in different ways. 

I’ll look past the main trio’s flaws, because a) they’re kids/teenagers, and b) it’s their story to come of age and mature after trials and tribulations, so they’re better flawed than to be Mary Sue and Gary Stu’s.

On the flip side, some of the supposed “evil” characters also have redeeming qualities. Narcissus Malfoy saved the plot due to her motherly love. Harry’s aunt, despite hating his guts due to her resentment towards Lily, still took him in. I already mentioned Regulus and Snape (the latter I still consider creepy, and he only worked for his personal motivations until the very end, never out of good or evil). 

Wormtail is an interesting one, because it’s less that he has a redeeming quality, more that his main character trait ended up becoming his character resolution, similar to the climax of Lord of The Rings which I will consider peak fiction (pun somewhat intended).

There’s the stable characters with no significant divergence: McGonagall was always cool, the Weasley parents were always loving and kind despite their quirks/somewhat overprotectiveness, Moody was the badass paranoid war vet. And the obvious bad guys like Lucius, Umbridge, and Bellatrix made it easy to hate them as villains.

I guess this post developed from “huh, some of the good guys were kinda assholes” into “People are not always black and white, the good have bads and the bads have good”, and I suppose that’s the takeaway.

Turning this around to JK Rowling, I guess this applies to her as well. Despite her views, she still managed to write a sensational series that’s forever ingrained into our culture, and that’s not an easy feat.

What do you guys think? This might have been a fairly basic observation and a topic for middle school essays, but I’m just coming to terms with it, and I wanted to share with a community of readers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17l3e3w/growing_up_ive_kinda_realized_a_lot_of_the_harry/,2023-11-01T03:36:49Z,1006,3897,books,Harry Potter,POST
11w8kxj,Why hasn’t there been another Harry Potter-like book series phenomenon?,"Alternative title: WILL there ever be another book series phenomenon like Harry Potter?

To qualify the series would have to be massively read and enjoyed by ALL ages, from kids to adults. The series would have to be so popular you could strike up a conversation about it with a random person.  I loved/love that communal experience of reading where SO many people knew the references, characters, jokes, plot points. My 50 year old brother-in-law and my 8 year old can both tell me what House they’d be in. There hasn’t been a book or series even close to that level of popularity since. Will there ever be again?

EDIT: Loved reading these really smart and thought-provoking analyses here. Opinion seems to be divided. The book series that get the most votes for being a Harry Potter-like phenomenon are GOT, Hunger Games, Twilight, LOTR, and 50 Shades of Gray. I personally think LOTR is the closest parallel for a series with incredible staying power and ear worm world-building.

nkisgg,Harry Potter is a Horror Story From the Dursleys Perspective.,"I've always enjoyed the idea of speaking to snakes in the Harry Potter series. When Ron uses it to get into the Chamber of Secrets in the final book I was more excited than I should have been. That being said I think that it was poorly implemented in the books aside from that.
I'm rewatching the first movie and I got to the scene of Harry in the reptile room at the beginning. I began to think of how strange he must have looked speaking this language to the people around them. Then I realized that he seems to switch between parseltounge and English without conscious thought. This is evident in the dualing scene with Draco in the second book.
This would paint the Dursleys in a slightly more sympathetic light, not by much but at least a little. While I would never treat a child that way I can see how it might be concerning if not out right horrifying. Imagine you were at a family function and your adopted son started speaking in tounges, in this case hissing like a black metal singer, and stuff starts exploding. This would be horrifying and written with a different tone and a change of narrator we could have something straight out of a horror movie.
Now imagine you are the Dursleys and your adopted nephew is walking around hissing and blowing shit up with his mind. You hadn't talked to your relatives for years and now you are in charge of their son. He shows up on your doorstep in the middle of the night one night along with a letter that literally screams at you. This is all before you even know your relative is dead. You raise this child of your estranged relative reluctantly. As he gets older it becomes apparent that when he is upset that your nephew is capable of things that defy explanation of natural law. You have no idea what these powers are capable of or how dangerous to you, or your child, they are.
This all makes the Dursleys dislike of Harry Potter a little more sympathetic, at least to me.


TL;DR: The Dursleys adopt the son of their estranged relatives. This child, Harry, grows up speaking up in tounges. When he gets upset he starts doing crazy stuff with his mind. He then gets taken off to a school after a giant stalks them and kicks in their door. All of this must be horrifying for the Dursleys.

edit: Holy burrito bat man this post blew up. I honestly forgot I posted this before I went to bed last night! Thanks for taking me to the front page for the first time and my first silver! I went back through and fixed up some wording as well.

Edit: fixed the TL;DR. I would also like to mention that there is the whole ""mass murderer,"" for a God father. People have pointed out he threatened them before they knew he couldn't use magic. No one has mentioned that Sirius threatens the Dursleys as well. At this point he had even been identified as a mass murderer in the muggle world, and I don't think Harry rectified this misconception for them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nkisgg/harry_potter_is_a_horror_story_from_the_dursleys/,2021-05-25T06:14:18Z,520,6470,books,Harry Potter,POST

 Although HP is one of my all time favourite comfort series of books and I've probably read them more times than bare counting, I probably wouldn't say they got me into reading. That probably belongs to Roald Dahl or Enid Blyton, and Tolkien was my introduction to fantasy. 

There's are plenty of people who I know who love Harry Potter but aren't avid readers otherwise. 

There are plenty of booky people I know who love Harry Potter but it wasn't necessarily what got them into reading.

it22dr,Discworld Series > Harry Potter. Fight me.,"The world building is fantastic in both—perhaps JK’s best skill as an author. (Edit: changed my mind on this, see other comments below.)

And while some of her characters are iconic, many (the non-white ones in particular) are inexcusably flat. 

Terry built a world that included all sorts and never wrote a single character that wasn’t fully realized. I mean THE SUITCASE had more personality than Cho or the Patels. 

His plots were wonderfully layered and used historic references and settings to tell poignantly modern tales that never failed to recognize the humanity in all people. (And didn’t passively teach children to avoid going to adults for help when they were in trouble: My mother’s major issue with the series when I was young.)

Also Terry was one of the best when it came to writing women—especially for a man. I say this as someone who has read too many slightly-altered carbon copies of the same un-realized female character to not appreciate this. 

Don’t get me wrong, even though JK has some bullshit opinions and I probably won’t be reading her in the future, I looove/d HP like a lot of the rest of the world. But as time passes I’m more sad we’ll never get another Discworld book than I would be if we never got another HP book. 

Also McGonagall is my home girl but if I’m backing a witch my money is on Granny Weatherwax or Nanny Ogg. And Greebo would wipe the floor with Crookshanks.

EDIT: oh heck this post ‘sploded. Cool. Some things:
1. If you’re going to start Disc I do no recommend starting at the beginning of the series. [different books focus on different characters ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Discworld_Reading_Order_Guide_3.0.jpg)  and his first MC is his weakest. Start with Guards! Guards!, Mort, or Equal Rites. ❤️📚 
2. There is a veritable susurrus of “she has a right to her opinion” comments on this thread re JK’s [TERFy bs](https://youtu.be/6Avcp-e4bOs). I don’t disagree with that although I strongly disagree with her. But she does not have a right to *not* be treated like every other person on the internet with an opinion, nor does she have a right to my money. So many folks up in arms about a handfuls of other folks telling the internet we’re not giving a rich lady more money for her not-great novels. Calm down. 😘
3. Folks saying “apples and oranges how can you even compare”...see below. It’s pretty easy. Two things don’t need to be exactly the same to be measured against each other. And this is more of an artisan “sausage inna bun” up against an under spiced but super sugary “pumpkin pastie”.

On Sunday evening I was looking through books available on my daughter's Kindle for her to download and read at her leisure when I say that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was available for free.  I grabbed it quick and hoped that she would begin reading it soon.  Then the thought occurred to me, why not read it to her?  I haven't read a book to my daughter in years.  I read the first chapter and she was enthralled.  Having read the series myself years ago I knew what was going to happen and reading it aloud I am able to put the right inflections into the parts as they are needed.  And to say she's enjoying it is not even close.

Since that night I have read a single chapter to her each evening, sometimes staying up past her bedtime to ensure she gets the prerequisite chapter finished.  When we get to the end of the chapter she is begging for more.

As a parent I know that in the future when she is much older and has kids of her own she will think back to this time in her life fondly.  It warms my heart to know that I am making a memory that will last her lifetime and it is even more special because I know it now.

I loved Atreyu's explanation of the contradiction as ""It gives you the means, but it takes away your purpose."" Another great part was Bastian invading the Ivory Tower to make himself The Childlike Emperor, and failing which leads him to The City of Old Emperors, and I liked how Xaidye met her demise because she lost her will after realising how Bastian was now lost to her!<

qrj4zq,What makes Harry Potter great are not the plots or the magic but the mundane moments at Hogwarts and character interactions.,"I joined the Harry Potter train late. I first saw the movies and was impressed by them. They are well made entertainment with a lot of heart. I later read the books and found them even better than the movies. The movies breeze past you because they cover a lot in a short span. Whereas the books, without any time and budget restrictions, can go in on much more detail.

I was initially hesitant as an adult to give time to books meant for children and teens but my opinion changed early on. Not only do the books mature as they progress, they are also pretty fun to read. Interestingly, for me the plots and the magic/wizardry were unimpressive. Each book is a mystery where someone is trying to kill or hurt Harry and only Harry and his gang can solve the riddle. The magical aspect is mostly by the number and world building is okay. 

Where the books shine are during the mundane moments in between the bigger, plot-driving moments. This includes the class room lectures, the character interactions between the main trio, the Great Hall dinner scenes, the common room discussions, the banters with Malfoy and his gang, Fred and George being clever fools,  the train journey to Hogwarts etc. JK Rowling has written these characters well with nuance and interesting traits but not without their faults. 

The setting of Hogwarts is another positive. A huge castle which acts as a boarding school hidden from the outside world, with a lot of history as well as magical shenanigans aplenty. It makes you weirdly nostalgic for Hogwarts even if our school experiences are vastly different from Harry Potter's.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qrj4zq/what_makes_harry_potter_great_are_not_the_plots/,2021-11-11T11:20:41Z,821,10744,books,Harry Potter,POST
hqqdvy,The Harry Potter series has been a nice reminder that the trip is more important than the destination.,"I'm 34 and had never read the books. I did watch all the movies as they came out and I fell in love with the movies, the characters and the world. I was the type of person that use to say ""why read a book when I can watch a 2 hour movie instead"" glad I changed that way of thinking. Once I did get into reading I stayed away from the HP series because ""I already know the story"" so I didn't want to waste my time. But then my 12 year old started reading the books and wanted me to read them along with her also and so I did. I wasn't too enthused because like I said before I already knew the story but damn was I wrong! 

I'm currently 200 pages into OotP and I realized 3 things. 1. I don't remember as much as I thought I did about the books. 2. Holy hell It seems like the movies left out most of the interesting stuff out of the movies. 3. The trip is so much more important than the destination. Yes I know how each books ends. Yes I know the big plot twist and story arcs. Yes I know how the whole story ends. But none of that matters as you lose yourself into the books. It doesn't matter that I know what's gonna happen next every page grips you. Everytime I put the book down I immediately start missing the world and characters.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hqqdvy/the_harry_potter_series_has_been_a_nice_reminder/,2020-07-13T23:30:52Z,854,6761,books,Harry Potter,POST

q6v90k,Came to appreciate a part of Harry Potter I thought to be faulty before,"Just a few thoughts about a story that accompanies me since I was 9 years old (or for the last 22 years): 

I read Harry Potter when it was first published (in my country) and re-read it several times in my life. And every time I discovered some new aspects or read things different. Now there is one thing I always (=since I re-read it as an adult) found a little unnerving: It's the ""simplicitiy"" of the characters regarding the world surrounding them. 

Some examples: Harry knows about Voldemort and his parents from the first book. Still he learns very basic facts about the whole ""Voldemort"" episode in wizarding history pretty late. E.g. in book 4 he first learns what ""Death Eaters"" are. In book 5 he first finds out about an organisation (The Order of the Phoenix) his parents where part of. And so on. I always thought to myself ""Oh, come on now, he is 13/14/15 by now. He should know that much about history for ages already especially if it's such an important part of his personal life. He would've researched, he would've asked."" It's the same with other basic things about the wizarding world which only get explained very late in the books. 

Of course the explanation is that these things were just not important for the plot until now so Rowling didn't have to invent and mention them earlier in the series. Still it always felt so freaking unnatural to me that a 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16 year old kid would know so little about the world he is living in and I always felt there has to be a better way of introducing these facts than Harry or even Ron who grew up in a wizard family asking stupid questions (""Death Eaters? Never heard of that before."" kinda stuff) about the most basic things regarding the history, the ministry etc. 

Last year I started to teach at school instead of university and I realized: That's exactly how most kids are. They might have heard some terms but they are mostly clueless about history (if they didn't specifically learned it at school), the way the economy works or about political systems they lived in. I had kids in my classes who came from some war zone when they were babies or toddlers and they still had no clue about what was going on there or who the parties involved were. They knew some terms maybe but if they were asked about it in detail they couldn't explain any of it. And also kids who were born and raised here mostly have a very limited understanding of how things around them work. From my adult perspective I forgot about that completely.

So when I re-read Harry Potter this year after I started teaching I first felt that this was not quite as unnatural as I thought but a pretty solid character depiction for some (pre)teen boys. 

Just wanted to share because I enjoy getting a new perspective of an old read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q6v90k/came_to_appreciate_a_part_of_harry_potter_i/,2021-10-12T20:43:30Z,298,2717,books,Harry Potter,POST

ayi470,"For people interested in a sequel to the Harry Potter series who were disappointed by Cursed Child, try the James Potter fan fiction series by G. Norman Lippert. Four full length books are already out with JK Rowling's permission, all completely free!","The series itself features a fascinating new plot line related to but not dependent on Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. The protagonist is Harry's son, James Potter, starting at his first year at Hogwarts. The characters are a good mix of characters you know and their descendants, and totally new characters. The conflicts are much more multidimensional, with a lot more moral ambiguity and complexity, without straying from the plucky adventurous tone HP fans will love. The books also delve more fully into the theory and origin of magic, the international wizarding community, the history of magic, and the founding of Hogwarts. The writing style is evocative of JK Rowling without attempting to copy it, with a good mix of humorousness, classes, and childhood antics to complement the main conflicts.

It's available as an audiobook/podcast by chapter for free, and there are free PDFs of all the books easy to find on Google. Hope you enjoy these books as much as I have!

EDIT: As some people have pointed out, turns out there are actually FIVE books! Even better!
EDIT: To be clear, JK Rowling gave the author permission to distribute the books for free, but did NOT endorse the series as canon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ayi470/for_people_interested_in_a_sequel_to_the_harry/,2019-03-07T21:42:27Z,762,18504,books,Harry Potter,POST

I know the books are great and all, I know how addictive her writing style is, that she can create such vivid and engaging characters and places, and the stories keep you hungry for more...but IMO that still does not completely explain the insane hype that generated. I don't think there has ever been this level of mania and craze for a book -- a children's/YA book for that matter. So I am wondering, what are some of the factor that led to the hype? I've heard things like the rise in Internet (and internet fandom), JKR's rags-to-riches story, etc all contributed.

8q9z0x,Just read Harry Potter for the first time. It helps that I’ve forgotten most of the plot of the movies.,"I’m 22 and I can’t believe it took me this long - Sorcerer’s Stone was such a blast, I can’t wait to buy Chamber of Secrets tomorrow. I’m familiar with the characters but to be honest I barely remember anything from the films - save for a few of the major plot points.

But even then there’s big stuff I don’t remember like what was in the chamber of secrets, who the prisoner of Azcaban was, what the other horecruxes were, and what the triangle circle line logo thing was. I do remember quite a bit of Goblet of Fire though for some reason.

I think forgetting the movies kinda enhanced my reading experience because when I’ve tried reading other books of movies I’ve watched I have a hard time picturing things different from how I remember it.

Really excited to keep on reading ☺️

I haven't been able to read and enjoy those books since she passed away because the memories are so strong and even though she never read them my mom would ask me about the characters, the world, what was the difference between the books and the movies and we'd discuss the characters she liked in the movies.

Today we finished the final two chapters of Deathly Hallows, and the 19 Years Later- She is now 9. It has been the most wonderful two years and memory that I will always cherish. The reason it took so long to complete was that I let her decide the pace we would read, as I could see that some of the scenes were troubling and scary to her; we would stop for a while and read something else, while we let the plot and story of Harry Ron and Hermione settle in. I would ask her every once in a while if she wanted to continue, but if she said no, or if she still needed time, it was okay. I knew there was no rush. I left the option to her to choose if and when she wanted to continue. We let the HP books sit on the shelf bookmarked with a colourful Hogwarts Houses bookmark while she discovered other books and series on her own. 
Amongst this quarantine, we have been able to finish the epic tale together and I am raising my glass to every life-long Harry Potter fan! I am honoured to be have been able to witness her emotion of the story, from start to finish, as I did so many years ago. She absolutely loved it.

So as the title say, I've finally collected all the 7 Harry Potter books in the original artwork in which they were published.
3 of these books are first edition:
1. Book 4(Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire)
2. Book 6(Harry Potter and the Half blood Prince)
3. Book 7(Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows)

So here's the story (No TL;DR :P )
I read Harry Potter series for the first time in 2014 as ebook.
In 2015 i decided to buy a set for myself.
At that time one of my asshole friend suggested that as I've already read the books and can take my time to get hands on them, I should try to get the original illustrations. Our school library had the original artwork so I knew what I was going into.
I couldn't find the original artwork online in my country though.
So hence began my journey of 4 years going to cheap second hand book sale markets, book fairs, thrift markets and whatnot.
I got 5 books by the end of 2017 but couldn't find *Half blood prince* and *Goblet of fire* anywhere at all
But my journey ended yesterday. When for 7 USD($) I got my hands on both them. 
All in all just the price of these books was about 19 USD. Moreover, 4 of these books are hardcover and 5 of them haven't been touched at all. So it's a steal right?

But now I'm done.
And thought i should flex about it in front of you my reddit-stranger-friends.

s3f4az,I just finished reading the Harry Potter books for the first time.,"15th of November 2021, i went into my local book shop and bought Harry Potter and the Philospher’s Stone. The reason why i got the book(s) is because of a of a promotion in my shopping centre due to the celebration of the aniversary of the Harry Potter movies and at first i watched the movies from the first one to the last(watched glimpses of it through the years on the TV but remembering the first movie quite well due to me having it on the cassette tape and watching it quite young) suprisingly enough i loved the movies and was saying/asking myself “why don’t i just buy the books and see if they are actually as good as people make them out to be?” i couldn’t even remember the last time i actually read a book as i’m more of a comic book reader then books.

Fast forward to the 14th of January 2022, 12:35am, talking about Harry Potter 24/7, posters of Harry Potter in my room, watching interviews and videos and searching about facts on Harry Potter, to get the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets game on the PS2 to getting the first edition books of the Harry Potter books, becoming a big fan of the books and even planning to go and experience the Harry Potter experience in London soon, i closed the book to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows with just a big smile on my face.

I haven’t been so devoted to any book/comic like this in such a while and can’t remember the last time i have been so obsessed with a franchise before. These books J.K Rowling have created are absolutely amazing pieces of work and honestly, these books will always be special to me no matter how old i grow. these books are just too great honestly, words can’t describe how i enjoyed these books. these books are absolutely stunning pieces of work and i don’t know if i ever get to experience a book like this ever again. just the amount of joy i had reading this book is unreal honestly.

again, i’m so glad i found a place and a community where so many people across the world love/enjoy Harry Potter as much as i do and i’m sure each every single one of you guys are just fantasying of being in Hogwarts right now. i honestly wish there was a Hogwarts but i’ll never stop dreaming and will always have the books so i can just go back whener i want!

again, without disturbing any of you guys day or wasting you guys time,  hoping you guys are having a wonderful day and you guys are wonderful people! never forget that:) please let me guys know how you feel about the books below or please ask any questions! would be much appeciated!

P.S… to Luna and Ron, if you guys ever see this, never ever change man:)

edit: i do feel like i have to read the books quite a few times as i feel like i might have read past a few important things in the books, but honestly apart from them, they were honestly enjoyable reads! i feel like these books will ever stay in my heart and i honestly adore so many of you guys stories of your experiences with the books! keep sharing your stories down below and please be nice and respectful  to other people down in the comments!:)

edit: it’s honestly amazing seeing the amount of amazing stories i’m reading from you guys down below about you guys experiences of reading the books. reading through all you guys comments makes me have a huge smile on my face and i’m sure there’s many stories left to share on your experiences with the book! i want you to let you guys know if i don’t get a chance to reply to your comments, please dm me about anything you want to discuss about your experiences of reading the books and the whole franchise! again wishing you guys a wonderful and amazing day!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/s3f4az/i_just_finished_reading_the_harry_potter_books/,2022-01-14T01:10:23Z,307,777,books,Harry Potter,POST

15usugm,Just found out today that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was banned in 2001.,"I was at Barnes and Nobles a few days ago and I came across a table containing banned books. On it was Handmaid's Tales and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I was curious as to how the latter book was banned. Like, I understand why the Handmaid's Tales would have been banned, but a Harry Potter book? 

So I did some research and I found out that the first book was banned in 2001 for Satanism and anti-family themes. It was ranked number 48 at the most challenged list of books in the 90s. Reasons were glorifying witchcraft, hate, sheer evil, leading children to hatred and rebellion, confusing and leading children astray. However, of course, all these reasons were based on religion but all the Harry Potter books continue to be the most challenged books of the 21st century and are still being banned in certain places. The most recent one was in a Nashville Catholic school in 2019.

The reason why I never knew this despite being an avid reader is because my mother was pretty strict and restricted what books I could read, but had no problem with me reading the entire Harry Potter books and when I was into magic at 9 years old, she not only let me but helped me find a good magic book at our local library.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15usugm/just_found_out_today_that_harry_potter_and_the/,2023-08-18T18:48:42Z,305,353,books,Harry Potter,POST

18nrd0d,You Need to Read the Harry Potter Series in 2024!,"I know it is the end of 2023 so with that in mind. I want to plead my case for those of you that have never read the Harry Potter books. You NEED to read the Harry Potter series in 2024!

It's not just a bunch of books; it's a magical journey that has changed my perspective on fiction as a genre. I never really enjoyed fiction but these books are PHENOMENAL! My absolute favorite in the series is ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."" This book is a HUGE turning point in the wizarding world—it's got EVERYTHING. First off, you get introduced to the Marauder's Map, this incredible magical document that shows you the entire layout of Hogwarts and everyone's whereabouts. It's like Google Maps but for wizards. Plus, you meet Sirius Black, who's supposed to be this dangerous prisoner, but things aren't what they seem. The story takes unexpected twists which leaves you at the edge of the bed, and there's this underlying mystery that keeps you hooked till the end. Oh, and let's not forget Buckbeak, the hippogriff. Seriously, the magical creatures in this one are fantastic. ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is where you see Harry, Ron, and Hermione grow up a bit and face some real challenges. It's got a perfect blend of humor, suspense, and heartwarming moments. Trust me, you NEED to read these books because the movies don't do it justice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18nrd0d/you_need_to_read_the_harry_potter_series_in_2024/,2023-12-21T16:47:49Z,205,0,books,Harry Potter,POST

18cutjb,Harry Potter or Percy Jackson ?,"I've been asking so many people about their preferences these days whether they prefer Harry Potter series or Percy Jackson!

On the other hand, Percy Jackson is exactly how you expect a Gen-Z adventure book series to be written like which is rather fun. The sharp, humerous and ""edgy"" dialogues really strike the modern minds of audience. And even the storyline doesn't ever get boring!

8e7fnz,It's been a decade since I read the Harry Potter series. Reading them again was a magical experience I thought I wouldn't have again.,"What a ride these past five months had been in reading all seven books and the play, too, the Cursed Child.

There were so many details I have completely forgotten about. I only knew the major parts, but the small ones, the foreshadowings. And even the recognition of plot points that occur at 25%, 50%, and 65% plot points of each book. JK Rowling is a master at revealing these plot points at the right time.

Now, as for the Cursed Child screenplay. I know some may have not read it so I won't spoil the details.

I will say this much, it's definitely meant to be a comedic one, not a serious story. I've heard the ""bad reviews"" or mockery of the play. But in my opinion, I thought it was a great one in the manner of the medium. There were definite corny lines and I can't imagine the actors saying them,  but maybe not so basd as I imagine in my mind. The two boys in the story were adorable. I do recommend reading the play with an expectation of reading a comedy.

- The Sorcerer's Stone is the American title.
- My son reads really well, I just chose to read to him to spend quality time before bed and encourage the LOVE of reading. 
- He is so excited for our reading time at night and I think he's getting just as much out of it as I am.

wqedf5,Harry Potter is not good,"Harry Potter is a series that I never found appealing when I watch the movies when I was a kid and thought they were ok but everyone kept telling me the books were better so in grade 7  I read the books and still thought they were ok. There was a part in the fourth book where it says that the house elves like being slaves and I also hated how after the third book the books got three times longer. So a couple of months ago I gave the series another chance and my opinions got worse. The storyline makes no sense, in the first book Voldemort wants to kill Harry but in the fourth book when he needs Harry for his resurrection also the time turners were way too overpowered and felt like they were made for the story of the third book and not given any second thought. The ending was horrible they never fixed anything, they set up in the fifth book about the racism in the wizarding world and that Voldemort was just a more extremist version of the wizarding world but they never acted on it, it just went back to the status quo. I feel the like series would have been better if J.K kept it like the first three books that weren't super serious like the last four books. I also have other problems with the series like the names for magic felt very lazy (literally using words from other languages like Alberto which means open in Latin) and I didn't know what made Voldemort so powerful except for him being immortal, all the death eaters spammed the same abilities.

It's found everywhere, a slow-growing, small-leaved, evergreen.  If you've got a hedge in England, chances are it's privet.

154psth,Constructive criticism regarding the Harry Potter series,"I started reading the books when I was 10 years old. I'm 33 now but I've recently been revisiting the series with a new lens and wanted to see if anyone else felt the same way about some of the off-putting aspects of the writing/the series in general. (I can very well post this on another subreddit-that-shall-not-be-named but that subreddit can't handle any criticism of the series, which is why I'm posting my thoughts here instead and also because my criticism is more from a writer's perspective rather than a reader's perspective) 

So, right off the bat, I still feel that the first five books were written pretty brilliantly and that opinion of mine has not changed. 

However, I've always felt that the quality of her writing went downhill in Half Blood Prince and the quality definitely got very very noticeably worse, atleast to me, in Deathly Hallows. 

Too many plot holes went unaddressed, too many character-arcs that were forgotten or not explored, too many relationships that weren't expanded on or explored and the overall way she ended the series felt too rushed and had too much of a black and white tone to it (too much of a ""good-vs-evil"" feel to it), in a world that is as complex as Harry's. 

Few of the specific things that left me deeply dissatisfied and wanted to see more of-


1) Charlie Weasley's role- why does our main character, Ron, even need this brother if he isn't gonna play some kinda role later on in the series? Charlie was a thoroughly underused character and considering he literally studies/handles dragons for a living in Romania, I can only imagine how much more interesting the series would've been (especially during the final battle) if he had to use some of his knowledge and skills with magical creatures in Harry's fight against Voldemort. Also, Charlie's connections to foreigners (since he worked in Romania) would've made him an ideal candidate to play the role of a recruiter of foreign wizards and witches into the Order Of The Phoenix (which was sort of mentioned in passing....apparently... but not shown or used in a way that would've made the series a lot, lot more interesting) 




2) Bill Weasley- Again....thoroughly underused character. The biggest example of just how underused he was: Harry breaking into the Gringotts wizarding bank with Ron and Hermione despite the fact that Bill used to work there and if anyone would've been able to help Harry with the task, it should've ideally been Bill. Not to mention, he worked there as a professional curse-breaker in Egypt, no less. Considering the war against Voldemort would've or should've gone global, Bill's skills as a curse-breaker and his connections to foreigners (since he worked in Egypt) would've made him an ideal candidate to play the role of a recruiter of foreign wizards and witches into the Order Of The Phoenix. 




3) Percy Weasley- I like grey characters. Especially grey characters that are torn over the decisions they've made. Percy was the perfect example of that. I saw the seeds of his eventual betrayal of his family way back in Goblet Of Fire but again.... his character arc wasn't really explored. Yes, we have a moment where he reconciles with his family but as a reader (and a writer) I'd like to see what lead to his change of heart. But more than anything else... he was again, thoroughly underused. If anyone knew the whereabouts... the ins and outs of the Ministry Of Magic, and the people who make up it's ranks, it was Percy. Considering that the ministry was infiltrated by Voldemort's followers, it would've bought so many more interesting twists and turns and would've made so much more sense to have Percy play a double spy of sorts, eventually helping Harry gain an upper hand with information about Voldemort and who his followers are and how to use them to infiltrate Voldemort's group. 





4) Ginny Weasley- I cannot tell you just how long it took for me to get over my disappointment with the direction that Rowling took her character (or rather... the lack of direction). She quite literally reduced Ginny to nothing more than the trophy-girlfriend for Harry. Very, *very* disappointing. Whether it's Ginny's connection to Tom Riddle (through her experiences with the diary) or her emotional connection to our protagonist or the whole myth of the 7th child of the 7th child being gifted; I'm very, very surprised that Rowling didn't bring any of this into the larger overall aspects of the plot or with Ginny's overall character-arc, considering how much of her world-building is deeply rooted in popular myths and legends. Again, very, very disappointing. 





5) the locked door in the department of mysteries- I mean, we literally get a whole-ass page of Dumbledore explaining to Harry (in Order Of The Phoenix) of what that locked door contained. For those who've forgotten, the locked door contains ancient sorcery/magicks that are deeply rooted in love; which is the basis of Harry's protection charm from Lily, since her act of self-sacrifice to protect Harry (which is an act of love), triggered those ancient energies/sorcery/magicks/what-have-you. Part of the reason why Harry even asked Dumbledore about that door is *precisely* because Harry himself seemed transfixed by the locked door when he passes by it. I don't understand for the life of me why Rowling felt the need to pull a deus ex machina with that extremely convoluted plot-line about the Deathly Hallows and the elder wand and it's ownership rules when Lily's protection magic literally rebounded Voldemort's curse, causing Voldemort's already mutilated soul to be ripped from his destroyed body. The answer to defeating Voldemort's second rising was RIGHT THERE. Why create something completely new to end your series when the answer to end it on a more *complete* note, was right there?! Either Rowling didn't want to expand upon the spiritual implications of that major dropped plot-point or she simply wanted to get the series over and done with because Warner Brothers gave her a deadline since the movies were already in production. 




6) Victor Krum and Fleur Delacour- I don't understand why Rowling would spend the whole of an entire book (Goblet Of Fire) introducing us to foreign students if you have no intention of using them in some major way in the over-arching plot of the series. The war-against-Voldemort wasn't rooted to Britain alone. Voldemort's mission was to eventually go global and it makes no sense to not include foreign students in the fight. Victor Krum and Fleur Delacour could have been major assests to Harry if he wanted to amass an army, globally, in his fight against Voldemort. But more than anything else, both of their characters weren't really explored considering that although Fleur didn't perform well at the Triwizard tournament, there must've been some reason why she was selected out of the hundreds of students by that Goblet of fire to perform at the tournament. Maybe it's her Veela genes/magicks Or maybe it's something more that we've yet to see. And again, the same logic kinda applies to Victor too. They both must've been powerful candidates, for the Goblet to select their names for the tournament. Rowling had the chance to explore that aspect of both of their characters and expand their roles. The series would've better for it. 





7) Luna and Neville- this doesn't get talked about often but Neville and Luna should've been included in Harry's inner circle. The HP series is a coming of age story, and part of growing up is making new friends and new emotional connections that are just as valuable as your older connections. I expected Harry's social circle to eventually expand. It's a normal part of growing up. You don't just stick to two friends you've known since childhood. And while Rowling kinda touched upon this in the last three books, she still writes Harry as being distant with both Neville and Luna unless you absolutely needed them for plot reasons. Somehow, that unexplored budding platonic connection that Harry had with these two was not explored enough and not true to life because in all honesty..... the trio (Harry, Ron and Hermione) needed an expansion. It was long overdue. Somehow the trio's close knit circle, as sweet as it seems on the surface, needed to be challenged and expanded. Harry needed to realize that this war was bigger than him and Ron and Hermione and that he needed more people on his side that he could trust and lean on. With the weight of the world resting on Harry's shoulders, it seems unrealistic that Ron and Hermione are his only close friends. Deathly Hallows would've been a lot, LOT more interesting and exciting to read if we could shift from Harry's pov in the long-drawn-out forest sequences to Neville and Luna's pov's during their time at Hogwarts, recruiting and training students for Dumbledore's Army Or if Neville and Luna had simply joined Ron and Hermione (midway....and not near the end of the book) to help Harry fight Voldemort.

Harry Potter is honestly just an escape for me now. no books has ever done this to me before and never thought it would. i just love every single second of it. honestly so glad i found a community where i’m sure all of you guys love Harry Potter the exact same way as i do! 

Wish me luck guys!

edit: damn i’m seeing a few downvotes in some comments, mainly due to JK Rowlings past comments or just based on JK Rowling etc , i rather you guys just be friendly towards one another and please be respectable to other people’s comments and try spread positivity if possible! would be much appreciated!

edit: honestly is crazy the amount of wonderful and amazing stories i’m seeing about people opinions about Harry Potter and it really is touching. i thought i was the only one but it’s crazy that the candle/flame for the Harry Potter books/franchise hasn’t blown out yet and don’t think it ever will. i’m honestly wasn’t expecting so much awards or responses to this post, it’s honestly insane seeing the amount of upvotes on this. just to let you know guys i’m reading every single one of your comments and it honestly puts a smile on my face reading you guys stories of the books and how it made a positive influence in your life! again, hope you guys are having an amazing/wonderful day!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rzbzbr/currently_on_the_last_book_of_the_harry_potter/,2022-01-08T22:32:29Z,100,310,books,Harry Potter,POST
72bm57,Harry Potter is a solid children's series - but I find it mildly frustrating that so many adults of my generation never seem to 'graduate' beyond it & other YA series to challenge themselves. Anyone agree or disagree?,"Hope that doesn't sound too snobby - they're fun to reread and not badly written at all - great, well-plotted comfort food with some superb imaginative ideas and wholesome/timeless themes. I just find it weird that so many adults seem to think they're the apex of novels and don't try anything a bit more 'literary' or mature...

Tell me why I'm wrong!

Edit: well, we're having a discussion at least :)

Edit 2: reading the title back, 'graduate' makes me sound like a fusty old tit even though I put it in quotations

Last edit, honest guvnah: I should clarify in the OP - I actually really love Harry Potter and I singled it out bc it's the most common. Not saying that anyone who reads them as an adult is trash, more that I hope people push themselves onwards as well. Sorry for scapegoating, JK

I don't have a problem with most of the deaths because they have a true impact on the storyline, they're not killed without purpose, but one that I really disliked (mostly because it made me cry a lot) is Sirius Black.

Also, in the same note as Draco Malfoy, I wish the Malfoy family had a deeper story, rather than just make them be bad for the sake of it. Idk, maybe I'd make them turn to the good side in the last books, or make them be less classists from the start. I read on various pages some theories about Draco Malfoy helping the golden trio in the first books, but I wish it was canon and not just a theory.

gxoqk4,Is Harry Potter immature?,"I’m 20 years old, and I have a Harry Potter tattoo. They were the first “real” books I read, and I felt so grown up reading the biggest ones. It was ritualistic to go to the bookstore and buy the new one every year.

I love Harry Potter, and it will always been apart of my life, but I feel so immature talking about it! Especially because of the drama JK Rowling has been in, I feel foolish and childish saying “I like Harry Potter so much that I permanently branded myself with it.” 

I still reread the books, they bring me joy. But I feel like it’s a guilty pleasure. Any other closeted potterheads out there?

14qhstn,Time Turners in Harry Potter,"In the Prisoner of Azkaban, when time turners were introduced, my reaction was less ""oh cool, new magical thingamabob!"" and more *uh-oh*.

Time turners, although rare and risky to use, do exist and obviously have the ability to change the past. They're not super easy to aquire by any means, but not impossible either, considering Hermione, the hogwarts equivalent of an eighth grader, got her hands on one. 

I know for a fact that knowing this, someone would try and steal or mantipulate their way into getting a time turner despite the risks, legal issues and Azkaban and undo/prevent the death of a loved one. I know Molly might try and get Fred back. She's really protective of her kids and might exploit her husband's standing in the Ministry. I know I would for a loved one. There are more deaths than just that. *Someone* must want their loved ones back that badly, if not Molly. 

Also considering how much influence over the Ministry Voldemort had pre-Lily and James' deaths and during a majority of the Deathly Hallows, shouldn't he have had at least *one* time-turner as a backup plan just in case things go awry? I can even think of a couple ways Moldywarts could have gotten his supporters to get him a time turner during when he was weak, during the rest of the series, or maybe even when he was dying in Albania somewhere.

I don't particularly like the inclusion of any kind of time travel of multidimensional elements because it's harder to patch up the plot holes because of the immense number of possibilities opened up. Just my opinion. What are your thoughts?

(i'm talking about the books, so if there are inconsistencies with the movies, sorry)

18s5gxy,Reading Harry Potter for the first time: I don’t like Hermione,"Hi everyone,

A month ago I realised that I had never read Harry Potter before (+ also never intentionally watched the movies, I saw them playing in the background when other people maybe watched). I felt this was strange since Harry Potter is such a big thing in pop culture, so I picked up the HP books last month and I’m now currently on the fourth book. 

It’s funny because I knew some things, like I knew of the existence of the Weasley’s but I never realised how many of them there actually were 😅 I never knew Percy and the other oldest two even existed.

Anyways, it’s been a really fun ride, my fave book up until now is the Prisoner of Azkaban one because what the author did with Sirius was genius. I went from being slightly scared of him to him being my favourite character (he went through so much in Azkaban yet he still has it in his heart to be there for Harry & SPOILER: he is innocent!)

The books are so fun and well written, I never expected children’s books to be this good. But one thing; I really don’t like Hermione… And I think I am supposed to like her The author is trying to make her likeable I think, but it’s just not working for me. In the book she does this thing where she “impatiently” tells the other characters things they don’t know but she does know cause she reads so much. She is not unkind or anything and her current passion for activism for house elves in the goblet of fire is really admirable. But she’s just not someone I would want to be friends with… Perhaps it’s to do with the fact that as a child I had a friend who was a bit of a know-it-all and it kinda triggers me. 

Also, book three with her cat (I forgot his name) and Ron’s rat, it just annoyed me so much that she would not take her cat away from Ron’s rat and that she would not admit to any wrongdoing when her cat attack the rat. Now obviously we found out a lot of new information afterwards but still, she annoyed me a lot in those passages and I sided more with Ron in that book.

Of course, compared to Malfoy who is such a jerk (I’m currently at the part where Malfoy is insulting Ron’s mom, it made me wanna beat him) she is completely fine and normal. It’s just from what I understand most people who like Harry Potter also like Hermione, which I don’t get as much. 

Does she change a lot as a person in the later books? It’s not like she is insufferable or anything but I’m just curious if it is just me or if the Harry Potter fans are a fan of her character in the later books. 

Anyways sorry for the ramblings and PLEASE do not spoil me for the later books, I have been having such a good time",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18s5gxy/reading_harry_potter_for_the_first_time_i_dont/,2023-12-27T17:05:23Z,52,0,books,Harry Potter,POST
jzcae8,I just finished the Harry Potter Series.,"I didn't enjoy reading when the HP series was coming out which was a bit unfortunate because I was in that age range that Harry was. 

Ive loved reading for years now and I figured I'd give the books a try and I absolutely loved them.  I couldn't put them down!  

Nearly the entire time I wanted to know more and more about Dumbledore and im so glad that his story was elaborated on.  I felt like every character had a story all throughout the entire series even after they weren't as big if a part of it or if they weren't a main character.

It was so well written and each book left me wanting for more.

I'm so glad I decided to read the books.  They are easily some of my top books to read and recommend now.

oo9nv3,Harry potter and the death of the author.,"My history with the series.
So I've had this habit ever since I got book 2 back in 1999 (i was age 7) my older brother would always take the new book and read it so I would reread the first book again well waiting for my turn to have it. 

Fast forward and I would reread every book leading up to the next release so on and so forth until the final book came out and I could purchase it with my own money and read it almost completely on release  night in July 2017 (age 25). I've found myself with a itch to read the books every October and can usually manage to finish them near the end of November. 

I read alot of other books many great fantasy series like wheel of time or brandon sandersons cosmere series. And I've read the lord if the rings any number of times.

My point is I love this series it feels like its grown with me throughout my life every part of my childhood is bookmarked with Harry Ron and Hermione witches and wizards and hogwarts.

La mort de l'auteur 
The death of the author in regards to JK Rowling and the Harry Potter series. I believe people change and that you are not the same this year as you where the last year. How much has the world how much has the author changed since the end of the series. Why should a author change the story once its been told?

Simply put this series has been a large part of my life but its important that we take the work at face value and not let the author destroy something that holds meaning for us.

There has been controversy with JK Rowling as im sure we have all heard but I feel like the term ""death of the author"" needs to apply for this series because its so much more than her books I believe Daniel Radcliffe said it best here:
 https://www.thetrevorproject.org/2020/06/08/daniel-radcliffe-responds-to-j-k-rowlings-tweets-on-gender-identity/

Great works have been made by racist men and woman take Lovecraft for instance he had a history of racism but his works have stood the test of time.
I dont think we need to ignore everything completely and i very much disagree with both JK and Lovecraft even well i enjoy there works.

By growing up with these books you make them asmuch your own story as well as the authors and I think that should still be important and not discounted because the person who wrote it is a knob.

I know I'm kinda ranting but its been on my mind alot the last few years and with no one to really express myself to I came here. If anyone feels similar to me I would love to hear from you down below.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oo9nv3/harry_potter_and_the_death_of_the_author/,2021-07-20T19:52:06Z,181,7,books,Harry Potter,POST

nhcq6v,Harry Potter: A Retrospective,"I grew up with the Harry Potter movies. I loved them. I read the first few books - though not all -, I owned all of the games, I collected the wands, it was my favorite thing in the world. That was a while ago. As I've gotten older, my love for the series hasn't dwindled exactly - it always did and always will hold a special place deep in my heart - but my passion for it has.

Whenever Fantastic Beasts came out, I watched it, and I enjoyed it. I didn't bother with the second one. Though I still had a love for Harry Potter, I had no active interest anymore. Around this time, J.K. Rowling started getting a lot of flack. First, it was that she was retconning things into the series, pretending she'd been planning things all along, and people were trying to call her bluff. These were criticisms of the story, of the plot, of the worldbuilding. Then, it became more political - x character has always been gay, y has always been black, z has always been disabled, etc. It was less about the series, and more about Rowling.

Then, as I'm sure everybody is aware, the transphobic stuff happened.

If my interest and passion in the series was slowly dwindling before, now a squad of firemen had come and completely extinguished it. I questioned the quality of the series, was it ever good to begin with? After all, I *was* young when I experienced it, and I hadn't rewatched or reread in a long time.

So I rewatched the movies. I didn't hate them, but, I didn't love them either. The love I had once had for this series - that special place deep within my heart, reserved just for Harry Potter - it was starting to go away. To be clear, the movies were not bad. Some scenes genuinely brought out strong emotions in me. At various points I had to fight back a smile because of the joy I felt for these characters, I laughed at the funny scenes, I even teared up Cedric's and Hedwig's deaths. But those moments were very rare, and the moments where I could point out flaws or things I simply didn't enjoy were far more common.

So I thought that was it. My love for the series was pure nostalgia. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. It was just an above average series that I developed a deep connection to at a young age, and my fondness stemmed from that connection and nothing more. It was bittersweet. I want to enjoy things. I want to love things. It's not pleasant disliking something. It's not pleasant discovering that you no longer love something you once loved, and loved for many years. But at some level, I was glad, because now I knew I didn't like J.K. Rowling's work. Now I didn't have to feel guilty over liking something she made. Now I didn't have a tiny urge to turn a blind eye and look past her faults to enjoy her series. Now I saw things for what they really were, and I could move on.

But recently, I decided to reread the books. I was bored, I was just doing some stuff with nothing on in the background. So I opened audible, looked for an easy book in my library that I could just put on in the background for some light reading, not having to focus too much. And I fell in love again.

I'm currently on book 4, the Goblet of Fire. I wasn't expecting these feelings to emerge again, but they did. I realized why I loved the series so much in the first place. And I realized how good the books actually are. The world is just as magical and alluring as it always was. The movies had many faults, but this was not one of them - they nailed the atmosphere of the world. The writing is great. I expected it to be very juvenile, but it's not. It's top notch. I expected the characters to be *okay*, that's what I thought of them in the movies. Solid concepts, interesting traits, but pretty shallow and not well explored. But I fell in love with the characters again. There are so many details, so many nuances, that I had completely forgotten from the books and that weren't included in the movies.

I'm really glad I decided to reread these books. Rediscovering my love for something that I thought I had lost, feels amazing. If you enjoyed Harry Potter as a kid, but you haven't experienced it in a while and your memory of it has been soured by all the recent things going on with Rowling - and thus, the increased criticism the series as a whole has been getting - I strongly suggest to read the books. Maybe you won't like them, maybe you'll rekindle your love just like me. Read them, and decide for yourself.

Sorry for the rant. Just needed to let all these feelings out. I know I'm not saying anything new.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nhcq6v/harry_potter_a_retrospective/,2021-05-20T21:58:38Z,94,52,books,Harry Potter,POST
141dht9,"Is the writing of Harry Potter actually liked, or more like tolerated?","Whenever HP and its writing comes up, the strengths are usually said to be the description of the images and the character driven story, while the overall writing is okay. 

One of the most repeated arguments in favor of the writing a lot of times is how the earlier books were written for children, and how they evolved over time to age with their readers.

Now, I have problem with that; Or more like, am confused. I LOVED the first movies and the world. Before that I got the first book as a child. And I absolutely HATED the book. I was no big reader, but I read. And boy, I couldnt get through any amount of double digit number of pages before putting the book to the side. As a child, I found it so utterly terrible written; I only went to the movie because of friends. After the awesome first movie I tried to get back into it - Goddamn, I just couldnt stand it.

As it happens, HP content likes to hit the front page. Im still nostalgic for the movies, so I often look into the threads. As the people argue, they often cite quotes of the books. And nearly without exception, even with later books, I groan and feel put off by the writing. E.g. conversations, they never flow or feel natural for me. It all reads so bad. I know this ain't GRRM levels, but I just can't read this. And I got through Eragon back then!

So, since the latest frontpage post, this just got me wondering... Does JR have some specific style that I absolutely dont vibe with? Is the writing in general just bad and people praise it for nostalgic reasons? I cant think of any other book (granted I read only a few a year) that gets such reactions out of me. Maybe something like 50 shades of grey, but thats only from hearsay - The movies I was forced through were enough.

Im just so confused because even as a kid I hated it so much, and I never warmed up to the books. Instead, it only gets worse whenever I see some book excerpt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/141dht9/is_the_writing_of_harry_potter_actually_liked_or/,2023-06-05T12:48:32Z,90,0,books,Harry Potter,POST

14p1ccp,"revisiting harry potter as an adult (discussion, spoilers)","so, to preface this: i did not buy any HP anything in order to reread the series. no more of my money will go to TERFs like joanne if i can help it.

that being said, i started reading the HP series in college and fell in love. did a few of the midnight releases, the whole shebang. i've read the series ten times over, but i hadn't revisited it in probably ten years just to a general oversaturation of all things HP and JKR coming out as a TERF has given me a hard time separating the art from the artist. 

so, i decided to listen to the original version of the audiobooks narrated by stephen fry i found on a free podcast to help me go to sleep, but i quickly found myself sucked back into the world and listening to the story almost constantly (so, no, they did not help me sleep despite mr. fry's dulcet tones). i have to say, going back to the series now is... weird. there's still some great stuff and a lot of it is fun but... but... it's kind of a house of cards? like, harry, hermione, and ron just get \*lucky\* so often that it detracts from their agency. for instance, in the battle of hogwarts, a really freaking pivotal scene, they have no way to kill nagini the snake and voldemort just so happens to summon the sorting hat and place it on neville's head which inadvertently gives neville the sword of gryffindor to kill the snake. like, what would they have done if voldemort hadn't done that? if he had placed the hat on a ravenclaw? if neville hadn't asked the hat for help? if he didn't summon the hat at all??

some things are so well built from book to book, like harry almost swallowing the snitch in the first book being important in the last. but there's a lot of things where one little thing could've gone wrong and, completely outside the main characters' control, it goes right by chance. so, i mean, is this common in middle grade/YA books? i know the HP books are not specifically meant for adult readers, but this happened just so often i have to wonder if it's a common theme amongst the genre/intended reading age group and maybe i'm just unaware?  

in all, i'm glad i reread/listened to the books again, even if it was a different experience this go round. also, unrelated but... stephen fry has some insane mispronunciations that are hilarious. like calling voldemort's mother meh-roh-pay instead of merope \*as it's written\*. stephen, my good bro, the gaunt's were obviously not a fancy family. that is not how you say that name. 

anyway... thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14p1ccp/revisiting_harry_potter_as_an_adult_discussion/,2023-07-02T22:33:28Z,40,0,books,Harry Potter,POST

16n6z6p,Did anyone not like Harry Potter at all compared to other ya books?,"For some context I read Harry Potter four years ago during the summer of 2020 I think? I was in 6th grade then and now I'm in 10th grade which feels crazy now that I think about it. 

Anyways I fully read all the books up to goblet of fire and only read a few pages of order of the phoenix, I think I stopped when Harry met Sirius again during that meeting about Voldemort I think? The reason I stopped is because I realized that I didn't care about the whole thing or really any of the characters. If any of the characters were to die on the next page I would probably just move on without any other thought. Except for Sirius who ironically was the character that died in that book. I only kind of cared about him because he made the prisoner of azkaban the only hp I would ever consider rereading

I will admit that I was never too interested in HP because a school for magical students? Yeah it definiltely didn't stick out to me at all even though I know that it popularized the whole thing. The main reason I started it was because I found this guy on youtube summarizing all the character stories on youtube(movieflame I think) and since it was quarantine I had nothing better to do. The characters seemed somewhat interesting and even the world. So I started it with some curiosity especially since my friends have been telling me to read it for years so why not(they're still telling me to finish it).

As I said before it was a really boring read and the world just doesn't seem that interesting after a while. Also I know that a lot of people said they liked the books because of how relatable the characters are. My only question is who exactly because the main trio themselves felt pretty generic(but harry does get some points because of his family). Now I know that some people might say that I didn't like it as much because of spoilers but one thing about me is that I will ALWAYS somehow get the major points of any media spoiled but that has never ruined anything for me. For example, I also watched the same youtube videos for the Hunger Games and it changed nothing. Hunger Games definitely deserves the hype around it and Suzanne Collins is such a great author with the amount of detail and thought she put into every single part of the book. The districts are definiltely my favorite part of the whole series. Are the characters relatable? Nope not at all but I love every single one of the victors and other side characters so much and actually felt sad when they died (its really hard for me to feel upset when something tragic happens in media). 

That brings me to another question, why did I love Hunger Games and Percy Jackson so much but could care less about Harry Potter? I already mentioned what I loved about Hunger Games so I'll focus on Percy Jackson. I read it before Harry Potter and its the book and it made me fall in love with reading. I immediately loved camp half blood and the main trio ofc. Theres something about Rick Riordan's writing that I love so much and so far I've read all of his books except for Kane Chronicles (tried reading it twice but just couldn't get hooked). I think that I like it when the main character has a bit of humor to them, and yes this does include Katniss. The thing that made me more attached to Percy Jackson and Hunger Games was the oc's I made for it, especially percy jackson. I felt like the harry potter universe felt restricting at times and I wish JK Rowling gave more effort into the other schools because Hogwarts being the only setting is so boring,especially since schools are in my opinion one of the worst places for a fantasy. Another part were the villains, I actually hated Snow and found Luke to be one of the best written characters in the books. Voldemort probably gets more interesting later on in the series but judging based on his backstory in chamber of secrets, yeah nothing really sticks out.

I also looked up when the first book came out and 1997?? My parents weren't even married at that time. This does make more sense because HP fits into the category of millennial things that just won't die like the office, friends, hannah montana, and disney adults. 

Sidenote: Marauders fandom is so interesting to me because they feel like runaway psych ward patients (compliment).

I do want someone to explain to me how Harry Potter is a literary masterpiece, not that I'm doubting them but I'm just curious. Anyways, this is just a collection of thoughts I've had over the years and  I'm going to end it here since this turned longer than expected and I have an ap java test to study for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16n6z6p/did_anyone_not_like_harry_potter_at_all_compared/,2023-09-20T00:23:43Z,58,0,books,Harry Potter,POST

11zey2x,Why had Percy Jackson not as popular as Harry Potter?," Harry Potter was a massively popular child to young adult novel before the movies but I noticed Percy Jackson doesn't have the same popularity and appeal. Why is this exactly? 

From my perspective Harry Potter is a basically a low-fantasy drama as it incorporates more emotional and dramatic themes into its story arcs which appeals to more mature readers while Percy Jackson and Riordanverse is more light-hearted fantasy comedy that incorporates some themes high-fantasy adventure as such there may be a tendency for people to dislike the series for relying too much on humor.

Now both are inspired by general mythologies and folklore but Harry Potter had the benefit of originality to make it distinct thus this gives the appearance of being creative and unique while Percy Jackson is modernized and Americanized version of  mythologies and heroes.

Overall what do others think? Why despite the similarities between these two young adult franchises one has succeeded far more?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11zey2x/why_had_percy_jackson_not_as_popular_as_harry/,2023-03-23T09:30:00Z,58,28,books,Harry Potter,POST

109tb7v,Harry Potter books stripped of J.K. Rowling's name are then resold by 'bookbinder artist',"I should start by letting you all know that I stand with the Trans community and am deeply disappointed and angry about the comments that JK Rowling has made. 

While I completely understand why someone would do this,  it doesn't sit right with me that someone would create a new cover on her books, remove her name anf then seep the book for $170!! If the books were sold at even the same cost as a new copy, that would seem less bad, but $170/book is not a price point that is accessible to most people, and I thought the reason for changing the cover is so that people who have issues with her comments can still somehow read the books without constantly seeing her name each time they see the cover.

What do you all think? Is it not wrong to do this, is the price not an issue?

yszv4z,What made harry Potter so insanely popular?,"Harry Potter might just be the most defining book series of this century. It encouraged an entire generation to read. But from a critical point of view, I find the books to be mediocre at best. They lack in originality. Most characters have a cookie cutter personality with only a handful being actually nuanced. The tropes and themes used have been done to death. The prose is hardly remarkable. There is next to none world building or lore. The villains are so cartoonishly incompetent. And the ending might just have been the worst ever. My point is Harry Potter is hardly anything more than your average children's fantasy series with its only real forte being the escapism.

14zh75e,Harry Potter and The Cursed Child,"I guess to give some context, I was in first grade when Harry Potter and the Sorcerers stone came out on VHS. I remember going to eat at a buffet after my basketball game and is grabbing a copy at Walmart. 

I remember how obsessed me and my twin brother were with the Harry Potter series. He had a toy Harry Potter that came with blue slime and I think it him or me that had the three headed dog toy. We also played the chamber of secrets game on our PlayStation 2 many times. I’m hoping to go visit universal one day soon and see their setup. 

I still love the whole wizard world and am a Gryffindor. I finally took the time to read this play.

I see it gets a lot of mixed reviews and some hate but I enjoyed it decently. I think it plays off a lot of emotions and reading at a time when I’m a father too have a part in it.

It makes me want to see the theatre play if ever given a chance, If it’s still a thing. It makes me want to read the books all over again and look into more of the fanfic.

v3t9wi,Wanting to Read Harry Potter as a queer adult,"So as a kid I was never allowed to read harry potter, because my parents thought I may get ""scared"" of the ghosts and warewolves. This ended up in me getting a HUGE FOMO, everytime my friends or cousins discussed hp, which still continues as an adult in many discussions surrounding books.

I decided to read it in 2020 because I got done with exams, and just then jkr dropped horrible horrible statements against my trans siblings, at a time when I was still questioning my gender identity.

I do feel like reading it, as I have watched half the movies, and EVERYONE tells me to read the books first, but it doesn't feel right to support an author who basically doesn't support my or my trans and enby siblings' existence.

If any other queer folx were stuck in the same dilemma, how did you go about this? Should I give them a shot to make up for a lost part of childhood

15uy51d,[Spoilers] Reading Harry Potter Way Too Late,"I was pretty much the target age range for Harry Potter when the books were being released. In fact, I read the first book in 1998 or 99. I never read the sequels, though. At most, I would occasionally catch pieces the movies on TV. This continued up until 2022 when I'm 34 and the legacy of the books, their adaptations, the author, and the extended universe have undergone a few changes.

I decided last year that I'd become burnt out reading mainly non-fiction while trying to catch up with ""classics."" I decided that I would catch up on the popular literature I'd missed over my lifetime, which meant that I finally got around to reading Harry Potter.

My first impressions were that I enjoyed the first three books. They're fairly obviously aimed at kids roughly 10 to 13 years-old, so with that frame of reference I found them to be enjoyable and even pretty engaging. Had I kept up with the series as a kid instead of my other interests, I likely would have become a fan of the books.

The first three largely have the same formula: Harry lives with the Dursleys, Harry gets to school, Harry encounters a bunch of Chekov's Guns in the form of magical objects and characters, the plot boils, and the Chekhov's Guns all show up to help solve the problem by the end of the school year. Then Dumbledore explains to everyone what happened over the course of the plot and the book ends.

The first three books are imaginative and easy-to-access stories full of interesting characters and mysteries. I'll also say that this is one of the very, very few series where I consider the comedic dialogue to actually be good and better than even most books revered for their humorous dialogue, which is rare for any literature, and even rarer in Fantasy. Most Fantasy-genre humor I've read usually relies on tortured wordplay with no comedic rhythm or timing; it usually just comes off as the author congratulating themselves for being so clever (often complete with characters calling each other clever). Comedic dialogue in Harry Potter however is short and punchy, leaving a nice pause before you realize you just read a fun little jab by one of the Weasley brothers.

I've said ""the first three books"" a few times now. There is definitely a tonal and narrative shift that begins to happen in the series, starting with The Goblet of Fire. Rowling starts to shake up the established plot structure- for better but mostly in my experience, for the worse. Goblet of Fire starts out with a pretty long, drawn-out Quidditch Cup sequence that drags on for quite a while. This is where we start seeing the background plans of Voldemort and his followers start coming out of the shadow.

Over time, character and plot backstory is filled in more, with more and more characters showing up, each needing introductions to the plot but also reasons as to why they're relevant. The plot starts to slow down as we see more flashbacks and receive more information about these people and the past in general.

Some cracks become too big to ignore at this point, and I soon started to get annoyed by the character of Dumbledore. Dumbledore hides important information to the point of being really distracting. Even while I was reading the books, I assumed that the reason why he couldn't share important information was because he couldn't, but it was becoming harder and harder to rationalize his tight grip on information about Professor Snape or Voldemort-followers when he would otherwise *vomit* exposition every chance he could get.

This is where the series began to really drag for me. I began to dread seeing Dumbledore's name come up in a chapter because it meant I was going to read another flashback or read another massive exposition dump, but in the end he wouldn't be able to give Harry certain helpful information because ""I can't, Harry. I'm sorry.""

The exposition and over-explanation in general he me really hard all the way up until the last few chapters. I could even see Rowling recycling the same plot stalling techniques, having characters disappear and reappear or having Harry run from location to location, usually with a new magical door he had to unlock, all the while interspersed with long exposition dumps about Death Eaters and Horcruxes. And then the final book just... ended in the same amount of pages that Dumbledore would use to tell some story about the past.

Even Dumbledore being dead could not prevent him from delivering a combined plot summary/mystery explanation/exposition dump at one point in the final chapters. And then the book ended in a two chapter finale. It feels like if Return of the Jedi had been one hour of Luke talking to Yoda, thirty minutes of Admiral Ackbar explaining the plan to attack the new Death Star, thirty minutes of C-3PO explaining the plot to the Ewoks, then five minutes of Luke talking to Palpatine and five minutes of battle scenes.

I think I overall left understanding why some people loved and continue to love the series despite issues with the author and with her work, but also understanding why the obsession with the books went from a worldwide phenomenon in the 1990s/2000s, to  having mostly a dedicated following as the series ended.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15uy51d/spoilers_reading_harry_potter_way_too_late/,2023-08-18T22:16:14Z,16,0,books,Harry Potter,POST

6unfnv,"Finished Harry Potter, Something's Off.","I just finished reading the Harry Potter series, and I feel let down.

I liked Harry Potter, he grew on me. I liked Hermoine, I liked Ron a lot, I liked Nevile, I loved (like, just wait, I'll write fanfics, I swear) Luna Lovegood. The plot was bearable, books 3 and 6 were awesome.

But other than that, I didn't like any of it. Here's a rundown,

* The main antagonist had very weak and generic motivations, and was evil for no reason.
* Deaths were handled very flatly. 
* Characters were never explored at a deep level except for Dumbledore and Harry. 
* The prose was highschool level, with only rare sections of creative words.
* The plot was occasionally meandering or overly complicated. (Deathly Hallows, Goblet of Fire.)
* Characters were inconsistent. I loved Prisoner of Azkaban Lupin, but he was boring and useless in all other books.
* Many payoffs fell flat. Horcruxes, Hallows, Grawp, Slughorn, Dumbldore's incident, Sirius's incident, the final encounter with ""You know who.""

At the end of it, I felt like I hadn't read anything. When I finished The Heir / The Crown I was inspired about civil issues and the difficulties of royalty. When I read Anna Karenina, I realized that women have the same issues now as the did back then, and that Russia has always been wary of Communism. When I finished Harry Potter, I thought, ""huh. I expected more. Why do people love it so much?""

And then I realized that people don't really love Harry Potter. A group of friends invited me to a marathon, and everyone had left during movie two. I finished it alone. People don't really check Harry Potter out multiple times, because there's very little replay value. (In my experience.)

I have a friend who's read and watched the series many times. I've discussed all of these issues with him. He agrees with some, disagrees with others, convinced me of his point of view a few times, and I he.)

So, what I really want to know is, has anyone else felt this way? Or perhaps someone can tell me what I need to do in order to love it as much as my friend does?

vm13qi,Harry Potter series,"Realizing I was coming to the end of this series, I could feel the emotions arising each chapter I finished. I told myself I was going to savor each page of the Deathly Hollows, yet would finish the next chapter faster than the previous. Weird thing is, I’ve seen the movies, you could say I knew what happened at some point, however it’s been nearly a decade since I went to the theatre to watch the final installment of the series. Maybe I was too young, or maybe my memory isn’t as strong as I thought it was, but nothing could have prepared me for the losses throughout this adventure. 

For starters, what I did know is that Ron and Hermione end up together (the most unlikely people to become a pair) as well as Harry and Ginny. It’s obvious that Voldemort would eventually meet his demise in the series, but that’s not what kept me reading. Knowing the first two movies like the back of my hand, I decided to start with the third installment to the collection, ‘The Prisoner of Azkaban.’ That movie was my all time favorite, with the iconic night bus scene in the beginning, as well as the comical argument between Harry and his Aunt. Just like that, I finished the book in a mere two days. 

The Harry Potter series created a newfound love, and appreciation for Young Adult books, readers, and authors. Say what you will about J.K. Rowling, but she knows how to make a damn compelling story. I’ve gone through reviews on the books throughout this series, picking apart the plot, plot points being tossed aside, or certain circumstances not making much sense in the end. However, my argument is, and will always be that these are not only fiction books, but young adult novels as well. The series definitely starts leaning toward the more mature side, but the writing is still as charming as the first three. If the books aren’t for you, they aren’t for you, but I absolutely adored them. 

Probably being my worst reading slump I’m finding myself in, I’m attempting to pick up other novels, yet I just can’t find the love in the characters I found for those in Harry Potter. Not to mention, nearly all the characters I loved met their end toward the final book of the series. 

I don’t know if there’s many other books like these, but I’m doing my best to try and get out of this reading hangover. I’ve been told Terry Pratchett’s discworld is a great place to start again. So you heard it here first, Terry Pratchett, I believe in your writing capabilities to bring me back to the reading world, and to find closure in my farewell from the fantastical school of Hogwarts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vm13qi/harry_potter_series/,2022-06-27T17:36:21Z,28,1,books,Harry Potter,POST

Now I know that Quidditch has the obvious advantages of beign a entirely fictional thing, so the author can take all the liberties she wanted (within the rules previously determined, of course), but nevertheless I think it's pretty amazing that Rowling made a large group of people not only read through several paragraphs of a sports match, but enjoying it!

aix1wq,Guess what a Harry Potter reread can do?," Life's been tough as a adult. Especially the last two months, I have a good job, but had to move to a new team, new house and a couple of health issues. Everyday I felt tired even though the work isn't that exacting. There are days I slept for more than 10 hours and feeling tired the next day. I couldn't figure out what the problem is, but I slogged. Day after day, week after week. Few days back I went to my parents place to meet them. My mom who's arranging everything in my old room, moved my books to a loft under the roof of the house. I saw there my old worn out Harry Potter books. I packed them all, bought to my house and started reading them. 

I took nearly 11 days to read the seven books and the experience was something I couldn't express in words. It's been years I had a reread and it felt like reading for the first time. I laughed and cried with the characters. Yes, it's mostly nostalgia but it rejuvenated me. I no longer felt like I was living days aimlessly (at least now). There was some ominous joy I could feel and everything looked brimming with life. Yes, I still have my health issues, the work problems but I am not bringing the worries of the work to my home. Books really heal us, and I experienced it.   
Thanks to J.K.Rowling for writing these wonderful books.

I've read other discussions and as much as I now Harry Potter has sold more than 500 million copies whereas Percy Jackson about 100 million, so wanted to ask u ppl which series is better, who would win in a fight, but just pls give unbiased and truthful answers. Now, most people say will the celestial bronze/Imperial gold/stygian iron affect the wizards? in this scenario, yes, and the spells will affect the demigods as well but they could dodge them although that's up to u. Is the killing curse allowed? yes since demigods would shut kill all the wizards otherwise, and finally, will Percy have the mark of Achilles?

10pedae,Who's your favorite underrated character in the Harry Potter books?,"**I'm curious to know who are people's favorite side characters** or c**haracters that aren't usually talked about.**

I'll start first saying **Viktor Krum**. I'm currently re-reading *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* and tbh I feel like he had so much potential to be a secondary character in the hole saga (and not just in this book). Other characters in Hogwarts seem to have so little personality in comparison to Krum...

Also, I would've loved if **Horace Slughorn** had already been a teacher since year one (although I understand it would have changed the plot). Idk, I feel like he would have been a great recurrent character, because if I remember correctly, he's the only ""good"" character from slytherin (at least of those characters who play a role in the Harry Potter story, do not count characters like Merlin).

And no, I don't consider Snape to be a ""good"" character (in terms of morality), I don't care about his past, that doesn't change the fact that he was a HUGE 4sshole to Harry since book one.

And on the side of villains I feel like Bellatrix Lestrange and Regulus Black could have been more interesting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10pedae/whos_your_favorite_underrated_character_in_the/,2023-01-30T21:19:04Z,38,0,books,Harry Potter,POST
512saz,My Thoughts on Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (Huge Rant Inbound),"I'm honestly speechless. I can't get over how truly horrifically awful this screenplay was. It's kind of insulting that they put JK Rowling's name on the cover to attract HP fans, since after reading about two sentences its painfully obvious that she didn't write any of it. As someone who has read the Harry Potter books dozens of times over and absolutely loves the whole universe, I'm so frustrated with this crap that I'm having trouble even typing my thoughts down. I'll try to summarize my issues in bullet points (Spoilers ahead, obviously)

-Who the hell thought it would be a good idea to bring back time turners to the plot? I mean even Rowing herself realized how much they messed up the story, and had them all destroyed in Order of the Phoenix. But the two geniuses who wrote this decided it would be a great idea to bring them back, and not only have one, but TWO. Yeah let's just give Malfoy one to hang on to for absolutely no reason other than Deus Ex fucking Machina.

-While we're discussing time turners, can we talk about how their use is completely butchered in this story? The time turners barely made sense when Rowling used them, but she was a good enough writer to somehow make it feasible by creating a closed time loop. When Harry and Hermione go back in time, they aren't really changing things in the past, but rather they are the reason that certain things happen. Nothing really changes from when we first read the book, we just get a better understanding of *how* those events transpired when we see them go back in time. This play just chucks all of that out the window and decides ""hey, let's change a whole bunch of shit that absolutely never happened and just take a huge steaming shit on decent story telling""

1. They first make Cedric fail the first task (Never happened in GOF)
2. They turn Cedric into a balloon to make him fail the second (Oh wait that actually did- nope just kidding)

*Personal side note: I also think it was unbelievably lazy of them to just piggy back onto the plot of GOF*

-Cedric gets *embarrassed* into becoming a Death Eater? Are you fucking kidding me? If humiliation was all it took for someone as level headed as Cedric MotherFucking Diggory to turn evil, then we should have seen Neville Longbottom shoot up Hogwarts about one week into his first year there. 

-Albus and Scorpius are about to jump off the Hogwarts Express when they're stopped by the Trolley lady who then reveals her magical powers and gives a whole speech about how she's never let any child leave the train before it reaches its destination. Then what do they do? Just like, fucking jump off the train. No big deal. There was no clever outsmarting of the Trolley witch or any kind of sheer dumb luck the likes of which Harry, Ron, and Hermione used to experience. Nope. Just fucking jumped off the train. Because that makes total sense right? This trolley witch has never ever let a single student (not even James or Sirius, for fucks sake) escape the train, but these two fucks just jump off like its no big deal. Like I get that they're writing this for a play, but seriously? COME ON MAN, I WAS ROOTING FOR THIS TO BE GOOD. 

-Possibly my biggest issue with this story is the villain Delphi. Okay, Voldemort would never EVER conceive a child. It was just the most idiotic plot and it kind of proved to me that the guys who wrote this really didn't care much for the universe that Rowling created. Voldemort wouldn't want a child to pass on his lineage to. His entire god damn motivation was to be IMMORTAL so he NEVER DIES and can RULE THE WORLD. HIMSELF. ALONE. FOREVER. Why would he agree to having a child? That too a child that could potentially match his magical ability, since his blood would run through her veins? It was just so god damn awful that I almost want to laugh and cry at the same time. 

I have a theory regarding this book: JK Rowling only contributed the part about Albus being sorted into Slytherin and Scorpius becoming his friend. I can 100% believe that and I absolutely loved that story element. She also contributed the Harry/Albus relationship struggles, which I also loved reading about. But aside from that, she did not have a single thing to do with this horrid affront to humanity and her name was only used for promotion. The plot was shit, the characters were shit (ALSO: Rowling's Harry would sooner cut off his own dick than disrespect Professor McGonagall, even as a child. Are we supposed to believe that as a fully functioning adult, he's going to berate her for never having children? I'm so angry right now good lord), the writing and dialogue was shit, and I honestly can't believe that this Play has not been panned by HP fans. 

The only thing I can think of to explain this is the Phantom Menace Effect: People are just so excited to have more Harry Potter lore that they can read, which actually includes Harry himself, that they're blind to the actual quality of the book. I hope that other HP fans realize how awful this is, and that I'm not the only one who was borderline offended by what I just read. 

Even though I basically ripped this entire story apart I honestly would love to hear from people who enjoyed it and hear what you liked about it (other than the fact that its more Harry Potter).

15woskk,Finished Harry Potter Books + Movies in 2 weeks,"I remember going to the movies each time the new Harry Potter film came out. I was too young to read the novels when the first two were released, and couldn’t bring myself to start reading books to which I knew the ending.

What a mistake.

But I’m glad it happened.

I decided I would read (listen on audible) each book, followed by watching each film afterward. 

Knowing the overall conclusion to the story actually worked in my favor.

It was like realizing that with each movie I had watched, I was eating a 6 course meal but I had been skipping plates 2-5 the whole time.

It’s the slower, intimate details of a story that, I think, really bring out the most connection between a reader and a character.


So, as annoying as it was knowing the ending of each book, it was thrilling to find so many details and conversations that the film adaptations missed.

s3nled,Mixed feelings about Harry Potter positivity here,"I didn't want to rain on anyone's parade in particular, so I am making this its own post.

While I can fully understand that Harry Potter was integral to a lot of people's childhoods, I am beginning to feel concerned about the amount of seemingly uncritical positivity about them on this sub.

Separating the art from the artist is a concept I struggle with a lot because the perfect human has yet to be born and a wholly unproblematic person simply does not exist. I think doing so is easier when the author in question is long dead or has explicitly changed for the better.

JK Rowling is alive and well, though. And she is using her money and cultural relevance in the here and now to spread intense, vitriolic transphobia in a time when trans people already struggle immensely in the UK. For those unaware, JKR got into a bunch of hot water about liking transphobic tweets, defending known transphobes and eventually wrote ""TERF Wars"" - a manifesto about how much the social advancements of trans people bother her, how we need to think of the children, and how she justifies it all via her own unprocessed trauma. Oh and then she wrote a whole book about a cross-dressing serial killer. 

And. I don't know. As someone who knows and loves trans people and hears about their struggles and triumphs daily... I just can't look at her works the same way anymore.

I don't want to make anyone here stop reading these books, but it is strange to me how there's so much o joy about them here on this sub without anyone saying a single word about the fact that their author is kind of the worst.

I can't make you feel like I do, I just want to share my perspective and for me her work is forever tainted by the things she is saying in the here and now. I can't endorse the work of someone who doesn't believe my friends are people worthy of love and respect and freedom. I just can't.

Edit: The replies to this have been extremely tiring, safe for a few nice ones. Just some clarifications before I'll likely leave both this post and subreddit behind:

- I never said separating art from the artist isn't a thing, I honestly stated that I struggle with it as a concept

- I don't ""hate"" JKR in some vague, non-specific way, I have specific grievances with her. I stated them. I am not ""looking for a reason to hate her"", there are plenty readily available to see.

- She does not have a ""different opinion"", she wants trans people to have fewer rights. That's not an opinion, that's tangible harm she's doing by being a powerful person speaking like this publicly.

Anyway, goodbye.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/s3nled/mixed_feelings_about_harry_potter_positivity_here/,2022-01-14T08:40:09Z,44,0,books,Harry Potter,POST

v289xo,Harry Potter or Percy Jackson,"Hello everybody just a quick question for those who read fiction:
I’ve finished the Harry Potter series (books) and I’m now reading Percy Jackson (but didn’t finish it yet still in the Titan’s Curse)
Which series (Harry Potter or Percy Jackson) is the best in your opinion?
For me:
Harry Potter still has a slight edge because I found it a bit more interesting (especially the Deathly Hallows) and what I like most is that Harry the main character gets character development throughout the whole series like Percy who gets his only development in the lightning thief and then he only improves slightly.
But in Harry Potter, I disliked some plot points like how badly did Sirius treat Harry in the Order of the Phoenix but otherwise both series are great.
I can’t judge the Percy Jackson series too much because I didn’t finish that one yet. Edit: I’m now in the battle of the labyrinth I am much more immersed!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v289xo/harry_potter_or_percy_jackson/,2022-06-01T04:07:54Z,26,0,books,Harry Potter,POST

It was also around the time when the movies came out and the fandom blew out of proportion. By the end of the series I was just massively bored.

krnc8p,"Harry Potter, literature or not?","Do you think the Harry Potter saga should be considered literature or not?

My university teacher said literature must be ""deeper"" and developed an intense debate about it.

The RAE (Royal Spanish Academy) considers literature the art of verbal expression, including written or oral texts, but I think there can be different views about this.

Also, what is your ""literature"" concept?

Edit: He always says that books normally are pretext/contents but literature must be pretext/contents/contents. The first ones can have subplots that make the story harder or be so well-written but they don´t have that second level of contents that make the novel ""deeper"". He considers the story is deeper when the book has some significant messages, is high meaning in its period or has value to its trend. For example, he also doesn't consider *Sherlock Holmes* literature but defends Allan Poe, Lovecraft and other known authors so he isn't based in their popularity to say that.

How does the ministry ensure that the muggle parents of these children, or potentially partners of wizards, not spread the word about the wizarding world? Surely, if the world was supposed to be kept a secret, dating muggles would be forbidden. 

Also: How do mudblood children like Hermionie afford any of the school supplies, or even get to Diagon Alley? Harry had his parents inheritance and Hagrid to guide him. Hermionie would have had no previous interaction with wizards currency since her parents are muggles.

wyb2w5,Rant vs Harry Potter an the goblet of fire ending.,"I think Harry was a little bit of as asshole for giving all his money to Fred and George, I mean, why not giving some to Ron, if I remember right, he only offered it to Cedric's parents, I'm sure the Weasleys could have used it, even Sirius, my guess is that he doesn't have that much money available. Maybe split it would've been nice, half to the joke shop and the rest to everyone else.

I know the intention of giving this money is to provide laughter in the dark times coming, and it's harry's money so he can do whatever he want, but even though...

Edit: I agree that the Weasleys wouldn't have taken it straight away, I'm guessing it could be through Dumbledor, offer Arthur to give some muggle artifacts workshop or something like that on Howarts which could be well remunerated and funded with some of that money.

Edit 2: as u/GringottsWizardBank says:  ""I don’t know. Arthur Weasley seems pretty bad with money.

I’ve re-read all the Harry Potter books and they are absolutely brilliant. And for some reason, even through there are tons of inconsistencies, you hardly ever pay attention to them when trading the books. Things like:

- guns
- Overpowered artefacts not used all the time (invisibility cloak, time rewind)
- mortal danger to all kids even during normal classes and virtually no one dying because of them
- muggles never noticing anything strange almost on a daily basis and realising there is a magical world out there

And so on. My question is, why do you think that despite all these inconsistencies, Harry Potter works great and you hardly notice them during reading?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/w75yla/question_why_do_harry_potter_books_work_despite/,2022-07-24T21:06:54Z,28,0,books,Harry Potter,POST

eurhjq,Harry Potter and the Vanishing Editor,"**The Harry Potter books are perfect and holy in every way, but – can they be improved with another polish? And how?**

&#x200B;

Go Set A Watchman, published in 2015, was the most pre-ordered book since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The publicity claimed Go Set A Watchman as Harper Lee’s sequel to her iconic 1960 novel To Kill A Mockingbird. Bookshops threw midnight launch parties, echoing Harry Potter.

But Go Set A Watchman is not To Kill A Mockingbird’s sequel. It is the book’s first draft. In 1960 this first draft was transformed from “a series of anecdotes”\* into a “fully-conceived novel” — or in the author’s words, a “good idea” into “a gem”.

Editor Tay Hohoff helped Harper Lee refocus the story on six-year-old Scout, and encouraged her to drop chapters with the same character as a young woman. The novel they crafted, To Kill A Mockingbird, won the Pulitzer Prize.

&#x200B;

**Harry Potter and the Vanishing Editor**

The Harry Potter series became a thing apart with its fourth entry, published in July 2000: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. To prevent spoilers, release dates in the UK and USA were synced. The midnight release parties began. And that September, filming started on the first movie.

The first three books emerged as a fairly regular piece of publishing, but from Book Four onwards, Harry Potter is an industry. By the fifth book JKR was described as being richer than The Queen. Soon after, she became the first author billionaire.

*How can an editor tell the billionaire goose to revise her golden eggs?* This author is way too powerful.

&#x200B;

**For the Flintz**

Harry Potter exploded into internet chatrooms at the dawn of the new millennium. Committed early fans nominated themselves as editors and flagged up inconsistencies. Marcus Flint, who played Chaser for the Slytherin Quidditch team, was in his sixth year in Book One. Yet he remains on the team in Book Three (Hogwarts students leave after seven years). Oops. Fans noticed the error and JK Rowling tagged such slip-ups as “Flints”. To correct, Marcus became a fifth year in reprints of The Philosopher's Stone. (Real editors play second fiddle to the readers.)

Meanwhile, the author incorporates ideas from fans. In Book Six, Ron refers to the makers of the Marauder’s Map as “The Marauders”. Why? To service fans who ~~didn’t understand apostrophes~~ had grouped Remus, Peter, Sirius and James as The Marauders since The Prisoner of Azkaban.

The need for plot secrecy also tied the editors’ hands. Eyes on each manuscript were heavily restricted. No chance to share a problem with a colleague without breaking contract! The atmosphere around the books becomes uptight. One editor’s difficult question may interrupt the productivity of the Harry Potter industry. And the first rule of business is: serve when hot.

&#x200B;

**Mea Culpa**

Jo Rowling has made excuses for three Harry Potter books:

\- Chamber of Secrets: she had writer’s block.

\- Goblet of Fire: she had a story crisis and spent a lot of time on rewrites. she struggled to hit the deadline agreed with her publishers. Pottermania was in full swing, and the movies underway.

\- Order of the Phoenix: writing OotP was a chore, she ran out of time and energy at the finish.

And marriage and babies and interviews and the charity and politics. Like her main character, JKR had too much going on ~~to be a prefect~~.

""There were a couple of the Potters and I definitely knew that they needed another year,"" she told the BBC in 2012. ""I had to write on the run and there were times when it was really tough. And I read them, and I think 'Oh God, maybe I'll go back and do a director's cut', I don't know.”

&#x200B;

**Stephen is Our King**

When the role of editor is diminished, the writer’s imperfections shine.

Horror writer Stephen King is the world’s second biggest author, worth about half JKR. He championed and mused upon\*\* the Harry Potter books:

“As a writer she is often careless,” he wrote in his review of Book Five\*\*. “Characters never just put on their clothes; they always ‘get dressed at top speed’.”

“The part of speech that indicates insecurity is the adverb,"" wrote King, ""and Ms. Rowling seems to have never met one she didn’t like, especially when it comes to dialogue attribution.” The best-known adverb in HP? “Dumbledore asked calmly.” But ""Dumbledore said simply"" is more prevalent.

King made notes: Sirius – “exasperatedly”, Mrs Weasley – “sharply”, Tonks – “earnestly”, Harry – “quietly”, “automatically”, “nervously”, “slowly” and “ANGRILY”.

King went on: “These minor flaws in diction … are the logical side effect of a natural storyteller who is obviously bursting with crazily vivid ideas and having the time of her life. Yet Ms. Rowling could do better, and for the money, probably should. In any case, there’s no need for all those adverbs (he said firmly), which pile up at the rate of 8 or 10 a page.”

&#x200B;

**The Perils of Structure**

The Harry Potter books contain a beautiful gay relationship that ends in tragedy. Remus Lupin spends 40 lines (across three books) simply looking at Sirius Black, before the latter dies in a fight with Bellatrix Lestrange at the Ministry of Magic. Then this story line evaporates.

JKR is a genius at forward planning and foreshadowing. But there is a flaw in the careful plan. Being fixated on the end goal she cannot allow her characters to speak to her. To fix the end goal of orphan Teddy Lupin, she smothers the flame of Sirius + Remus.

And Remus fights back! In The Half-Blood Prince and The Deathly Hallows, he resists his relationship with Nymphadora Tonks, resists marriage and resists fatherhood. He would much rather hang out with two 17-year-old boys (and, if he must, Hermione).

JKR felt Harry and Hermione pull together. This magnetism is palpable when Ron is absent in The Deathly Hallows. Harry even takes Hermione to visit his parents in Godric’s Hollow. They hold hands. There's a kissing gate. But a late-breaking romance between Harry and Hermione is not in the story plan, even if readers feel the frisson. Would a foolish coupling, one that can be blamed on the Slytherin Horcrux, have made the final book more epic? Screenwriter Steve Kloves made Harry and Hermione dance, to show the temptation and the characters’ decision to resist. JKR ignores the risk. She sacrifices these organic moments and succumbs to her pre-existing structure.

&#x200B;

**Insert Joke Here**

The final HP books wrap up the stories of Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort and Snape, but… are they finished works?

JKR’s story plan keeps the essential elements of the story safe. But having the path laid out allows the author to skim across details. Several times Fred and George do something funny and everyone laughs – but we are not supplied the joke, only a nod to some antics. Possibly JKR is bored of the characters. Possibly she was hot to write another passage and planned to double back.

Whatever, the basic rule of show-not-tell is ignored, which leaves vague holes. Harry’s schoolmate Dean Thomas\*\*\* drifts twice into the story in The Deathly Hallows – by coincidence! The story's romances feel forced. Ginny, who blossoms with interest through the stories, becomes a trophy in the final book, an object Harry repeatedly puts away for safekeeping.

An empowered editor would smooth away these curiosities and make good the minor beats as well as the major ones.

&#x200B;

**Good or Good Enough**

Jo Rowling finished Harry Potter in January 2007. All was well. The end.

Except there is no letup. Only last year: four new Hogwarts e-books, which unlock seven subjects from the Hogwarts syllabus. A third Fantastic Beasts movie, which promises more Albus Dumbledore, goes into production this spring. Plus, the Pottermore. Plus the Twitter.

If JKR can change the books to amend “Flints”, if she can consider her own “Director’s Cut”, and if she can continue to publish supplementary material to ensure the books are interpreted exactly as she intends, is Harry Potter an ongoing work-in-progress, like the movie Blade Runner (four versions, one sequel and counting)? And is the author the person who decides? Something wonderful about the Wizarding World: readers/fans fill the gaps with their own imaginations.

Thirteen years ago this month JKR defaced a bust of Hermes in her suite at Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel to mark a full stop on Harry Potter. I'm doubtful that her editor was in the room at the time. “It All Ends Here” claimed the publicity for The Deathly Hallows. But not really.

icqy2v,First time reading Harry Potter at age 21,"Didn't watch the movies before (and until now) , I already had the strong feeling and motivation that I will read this books one day. I didn't want to be spoiled by the movies.

I was dying to read it but I prefer physical books as I already have a bad eyesight and e-books make my eye sore. I didn't have enough money then to buy the complete series.

Just this August, I bought myself the complete series as a gift of my first year anniversary being employed. I WAS JUST SO HAPPY WHEN I RECEIVED THEM THROUGH MAIL!!!

And now I've finished Philosopher's Stone, OH WOW, HOW MAGICAL IT IS! I really admire Rowling as an author, creating a world, a new language of spells and potions, it was beyond amazing!!

I have a strong feeling also that this series will be dear to me, as I already shed tears when Dumbledore said the thing about being loved, even when that person is gone, how that love will continue to protect us forever. I remembered my grandfather who passed away just this March. Plus the fact that Hogwarts will be one of the world I escaped to during this pandemic...

mgdchb,"Has there ever been, or will there ever be another 'Harry Potter' Phenomenon?","I'm certain that my view of this is slightly skewed because of the timing (I grew up as the Harry Potter books and films were coming out) but to my memory, the Harry Potter releases were insane and unlike anything else in my lifetime. Fans lining up all night to get their hands on a copy and devouring it in hours, and also this being so widespread that almost everyone I knew read the books.

Whatever your views of the writing style, the stories, or Rowling's personal views, I've never seen anything else achieve this level of fandom in my lifetime (the closest comparison I can think of is iPhone releases, which isn't really books...)

Has there ever been anything like this in the past that I'm too young to remember?

Will we ever see anything like this again? Or do you think that changes to society/culture and how we consume media will prevent this? (Or encourage it?)

My view is that on the face of it there appears to be a much greater range of books and genres available at all ages, and so I think a series would have to have much more in its favour to replicate the Harry Potter phenomenon nowadays.  
I think that if we ever see The Winds of Winter (or A Dream of Spring) there will be incredible hype, but I don't think ASOIAF appeals to cross section of readers as broad as Harry Potter did

eua4u4,Percy Jackson deserved as much recognition and love as Harry Potter,"Despite loving Harry Potter and Percy Jackson equally I can't help but think about how underrated the Percy Jackson universe is in comparison to Harry Potter.

Percy Jackson had all the elements to be a universally loved series from its educational aspect on Greek Mythology to ride-or-die characters that you just can't get enough of. Not to mention the exciting quests, adventures and monsters. 

Though this series has an amazing fanbase led by Uncle Rick at the helm, I would've loved for it to have a cultural imprint on pop culture. Which brings me to my next point: the movies.

Most of what solidified Harry Potter into a worldwide phenomenon was the films that were perfectly executed and revered by the public. Sadly, Percy Jackson did not have this boost as the movies that were produced were less than satisfactory and deviated heavily from the source material. Also much of why the films failed to hit the mark was the casting of adult actors which did not match with the original ages of the characters, thus not balancing out with the audience of the film.

In conclusion I would like to say that I feel Percy Jackson could've been on the same level as Harry Potter and I just hope Rick Riordan wins the battles he is currently fighting on adapting Percy Jackson into a tv show.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/eua4u4/percy_jackson_deserved_as_much_recognition_and/,2020-01-26T18:00:53Z,48,62,books,Harry Potter,POST
oa4ih9,Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality,"I stumbled across this story entirely by accident, but I found the premise really interesting. It tells the story of Harry Potter if he was raised to approach everything scientifically, with critical thinking, logic and rationality.

I personally enjoyed it because throughout the story you get to see all the familiar things from the original books, but seen from an entirely different perspective. Harry uses the scientific method and applied rationality to stand a lot of widely accepted wizarding traditions on their head. There are scenes where he uses battle tactics that remind me a lot of Enders Game. Also, this Harry’s interactions with all the familiar characters are very interesting and seldom expected.

10j4w5o,"Which book or book series could become a huge IP/Franchise if they could nail the adaptations? Anything that could match up there with Harry Potter, Lord or the Rings, or Star Wars?","I think Game of Thrones is the next closest to that. Occasionally you'll hear it mentioned along the other IPs mentioned in the title. I think the only thing stopping it is that the Author has stopped publishing books in that series. 

Other books that their fandoms absolutely love are Wheel of Time, Mistborn, Stormlight Archive, and Name of the Wind. 

NoTw seems to have the same issues as Got for the author not finishing the series. 

WoT got an adaptation, which seems to have split the fanbase but ended up with decent critic reviews, which is above average as far as adaptations go. Seems it needs another season or 2 to tell if it can get more solid footing. 

Mistborn / Stormlight Archive seems to be the most accessible and complete out of the more highly regarded high fantasies. There has been progress towards and adaptation but no solid news yet.

I showed my BF the post and it was very aww, he's happy. I also greatly appreciated the awards, that was very kind! 

Today was a good day, I haven't finished a book in about a decade, and over the last two days I was very motivated to keep reading and read 100+ pages each day to finish the book -for fun! It was fun! 

I started slowly, -I hate the Dursleys with a fiery passion, I feel so bad for Harry- it was a bit of a slog to begin with, but once he got on that train it was an absolute joy to read! The characters are amazing, and the new antics each chapter were a great way to keep it interesting, develop the world, and move through a school year. The bonds you see building are really wholesome. Neville must be protected at all costs.

Even despite watching the film a lot, I was still very engaged with the book. I like how well it conveys how Harry is feeling in situations, you really can't capture that in a film, it's a great attention to detail.

17w3f4c,"So, back in middle school, Percy Jackson and Harry Potter were the two book series I remembered being the main ones we read.","Is it a coincidence that both book series had a protagonist with a “saving people problem”, by which I mean that once someone even suggests that someone they love is in danger, they will risk everything to save them. 

Both times, it ends up being deconstructed as a flaw. It puts Percy into danger and makes him hesitant to run away, often threatening his life in an already dangerous world. It actually ends up being used against Harry when he’s shown a fake vision of someone he’s close to in danger, and hastily rushes to save someone who was never in danger in the first place, which Ironically leads to that person dying.

I’ve also been watching each film after I’ve finished the book so I can compare. 
(Don’t come for me, I’m aware JK Rowling is trash. Love the art, hate the painter). 

I definitely see why people prefer the books tbh. There’s so many smaller details that make them worth reading. 
One being when Harry asks how Lupin knows how to use the maurauders map and Lupin reveals that HE is Mooney, one of the creators. This detail isn’t in the film; for all Harry knows, his dad isn’t Prongs and the map doesn’t have anything to do with him. Which is sad.

97i1ii,I'm 31 and I have just finished reading Harry Potter for the first time,"I'm overjoyed. I cannot believe I hadn't read the series years ago.

I'm not much of a reader. Have never been. But a good friend lent me his Kindle sometime last year for a month (I had lost my job and was terribly depressed) and requested I give it a go.

And... I was hooked from the get go! So much so that I purchased a kindle myself (sort of a gift from me to me) and read all seven books one after another.

Today, it was the final book's final page - ""The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.""

Such a bitter-sweet feeling. 

Bitter because I cannot believe I'll never have the pleasure of reading those books for the first time ever again. Those characters have become a part of my life, sort of my friends. 
Sweet because, well, now I can hope that magic is indeed real! (A girl can dream right?) That there's a Hogwarts somewhere out there, hidden from us muggles.

Best part of this all is that I've finally got into reading. I can't seem to fall sleep without a book.

Oh well, I'm sure I'll find something. :-)

Then, as a bonus, Aragog dies too, which somewhat made me down but made up by Dan's outstanding humorous perfomance in the films.

8i2q61,Why is Harry Potter so often compared with sub-par kids lit?,"I realize that my title is a little inflammatory, but I’m a little irked with the way Harry Potter as a literary property seems to be treated by some people. 

I remember a while back picking up the Percy Jackson series because I was recommended it by a librarian’s assistant and a personal friend of mine, who said it was “very similar” - the thing is, it wasn’t. 

Harry Potter is appealing to me as an adult. For the most part, Harry Potter is a coming of age fantasy story that’s written like it is FOR adults, in terms of characterization, emotion, complexity of narrative, depth and maturity of themes, the strength of the content, and the use of gritty, dark realism in the context of the whimsically fantastical. And the fact that Rowling wrote just as much FOR adults as she did for young people with Harry Potter, rather than simply seeking to appease or entertain possible adult readers, is important. It’s why the series is so biblically popular and well-loved.

Percy Jackson reads like it’s meant for a much younger audience than Potter, therefore, my initial reaction to the juxtaposition was feeling insulted on Rowling’s behalf. 

I don’t know why, but Potter seems to be compared a ton to books that really have quite limited age appeal. I’ve seen books like Fablehaven, Percy Jackson, Unfortunate Events, and Artemis Fowl compared with Harry Potter, but even on the superficial side of things, they hardly compare. 

On the deeper side of things, none of these are as substantive or as complex than Potter. As an adult whose read through all or most of these series to their completions, the difference between these books that are so often cited as being “like Harry Potter”, and Harry Potter, is that the feel like they’re written specifically to entertain really young kids. At most they try to be the piece of entertainment “that speaks to kids but is merely fun for adults”. Compare that to Harry Potter, which largely, to me, felt like a coming of age fantasy that was written specifically for adults, almost just as specifically as it was written for adolescents, still an older age demographic than Percy Jackson and Artemis Fowl are clearly meant for.

I’m sorry, but series like Percy Jackson and Artemis Fowl are physically shorter. They have measurably lower reading levels (Percy Jackson literally has chapter titles like ‘I Scoop Poop’), they’re written and constructed like cartoons or comics, they require a lot more suspension of disbelief, they’re much more lighthearted, they aren’t thematically prescient or mature whatsoever...

I keep seeing questions pop up like “why can’t Percy Jackson be as popular as Harry Potter?”...well, I think the answer would be that Percy Jackson is a book written FOR kids and no other demographic, per the words of Rick Riordan, and it was written as a bedtime story, whereas Harry Potter was written FOR adults, as much as it was written for adolescents, per the words of J.K. Rowling, and it was also a narrative that was inspired by Rowling’s real life experiences with death, depression, and poverty.

I mean, I’ve had arguments with people that insist Lemony Snicket is for the same audience as Potter, but come on...we’re talking, at a basic observation, a series that contains little books that break the fourth wall and literally define “difficult” words with a series that contains 700+ page fantasy drama novels with epigraphs about life, tyranny, and death from Aeschylus and William Penn. 

I mean, at least compare Harry Potter to the greats of adolescent literature, and not pop-y cartoon action comedies for little boys. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8i2q61/why_is_harry_potter_so_often_compared_with_subpar/,2018-05-09T03:00:46Z,65,0,books,Harry Potter,POST

i4lcb9,Harry Potter and the Fan Fiction.,"Has anyone ever encountered a fan-fic that they liked more than the sequel written by the author?

I was perusing my kindle app, and realized I hadn't read the 7 Harry Potter books (I will not speak of cursed child) in close to 10 years.  Thinking I would enjoy this romp through memory lane, I started a few weeks ago.  

Now I'm midway through Deathly Hollows, and I don't want to finish it.  

Because, before the seventh book was released, my mother heard the rumor about JKR's laptop being stolen with a complete version of the seventh book on it.  She scoured the internet without finding it... but she thought she had.   

She printed about 150 pages of fan-fic that read so similar to JKR, that I thought that the actual seventh book was a bit of a joke.  The only flaws were really towards the end, in post defeating voldemort chapters

So, here I am trying to decide on finishing the official book, or picking up a dusty 3 ring binder thats been in my mother's office.  The pages are worn, and dirty from being read so many times.  The family copy is worn a bit, but its pretty clean. 

 I have six siblings, I asked them if they had reread Deathly Hollows.  None of them has since they read it initially.   I asked about the fan-fic, all of them said they had read it at least once in the last 5 years.

Edit:  for everyone curious about the fan-fic, her is link.

We are both in our mid 20's and our introductions to the books are both different. We wanted to see how most of you would introduce these to your kids.

Would you read harry potter to your children and let them read the hobbit by themselves? Read the hobbit first and introduce harry potter? Give them the books and let them decide? Read them all to the children or let them read for themselves if they would not be age appropriate? At what age should they absorb these books? Any info would help us greatly!
