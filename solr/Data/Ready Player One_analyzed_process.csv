z77l3p_1,z77l3p,"Ha.  You are on the wrong sub to ask this question.   

I personally enjoyed the book.  But you are essentially just chumming the waters as this sub HATES it.  Ready Player One.  Dan Brown books.  Those seem to be a couple of the most popular books among people that this sub hates. 

I'd also say, in general, make your own decision and don't listen to reddit.  Listen to people with similar taste.  Or just stop reading it.  But this sub will ruin it for you. 

Hell, I'm sure for speaking the truth, I'll get downvoted to hell about it, and probably be called stupid or something for actually enjoying it",illini02,2022-11-28T22:47:21Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,1

z77l3p_7,z77l3p,"Imo the best part of Ready Player One is the ""chase"" factor of everyone trying to reach the end goal. The first few chapters fundamentally bored me, but from the first... Key? Code? Onward I was hooked wondering what would happen next. 

The characters are forgettable, the dialogue is cringe, the references are fun, and the plot I have almost entirely forgotten. I do remember liking it more than the movie though. 

Worst part of the book is undoubtedly when they take a break from the fast-paced ""we have to find the next clue"" action to spend an entire chapter describing how the main character masturbates. That was weird, right?",MataNui2009,2022-11-29T20:09:10Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,7

I had a great time from beginning to end, and if you're already struggling, well, you'll probably feel the same way halfway through the book, and by the end of the book.

Absolute claptrap in the middle of a bonkers story but the monologue sold the premise of the villain so well.

Ernest Cline is a bad writer. Simple as that. I've read enough of Ready Player One to know that whatever good ideas he has in the book, I just can't enjoy the writing of someone endlessly referencing movies and shows as a means of storytelling.

[This article](https://theoutline.com/post/2076/ready-player-one-movie-bad) is the best I've found. A must read really, incredibly well written.

Here's the closing para:

*Nearly every one of Ready Player One’s faults is a direct result of Cline’s authorial narcissism. The writing process appears to have begun with the question: What if the entire world revolved around me, and the specific video games and movies I like? The rest was assembled around that essential core. Cline is far from the first author to write a self-insert wish fulfillment narrative, but he may be the first to write one this lazy and self-indulgent. To place oneself in the character of Wade Watts, an 18-year-old video game trivia knower, requires no imagined heroism or personal growth. It simply constructs a world around the reader, where his comfort zone, his passively acquired knowledge of retro video games and Star Wars, is enough to effortlessly make him a Great Man of History. A fantasy this mundane is barely a fantasy at all — just a desire to be unjustly rewarded for mediocrity. And, thanks to Steven Spielberg, Cline’s mediocrity has been rewarded beyond his wildest dreams.*",zhawadya,2021-10-28T16:59:39Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,1
qhq6a4_2,qhq6a4,"It’s weird, I enjoyed Ready Player One for what it was, it’s not a well written book but the references kind of had purpose - they’re all related to the plot, things that can help uncover the secrets of the Easter Egg by  Halliday. It’s written in as his favourite things and it’s a huge part of the world, so naturally everyone is obsessed about solving it and develop obsessions over pop culture as a result. It’s not great writing, but it had purpose and was entertaining for me. I enjoyed the idea of it all.

Ready Player Two, on the other hand, was a steaming pile of shit, that had triple the pop culture references with no purpose or need to them. It was Cline stoking his own ego. It was utterly horse shit, and genuinely painful to read. Every character would hi-five, fist bump, dance randomly and “level a finger” all the time and it was just bad.

qhq6a4_18,qhq6a4,"> And I know this is an audiobook issue not the material but there really should have been a producer or someone who could correct Wil Wheatons pronunciations of certain words. He's mispronounced things like Aspergers (aspejers) and library (liberry).

I completely disagree here. I think the mispronunciations and other voice problems are entirely consistent with Wade. He's exactly the kind of asshole that would act like he knows everything and then mispronounce words while he's being condescending and self-centered. He's a high schooler obsessed with pop culture. Of course he would sound like an ignorant little shit.

It may not be intentional, but it's absolutely 100% correct.

-----

The real sad part about Ready Player One is that there's secretly an incredibly good sci-fi book in there that Ernest Cline simply ignored while writing it.

First, >!the sequence in the middle where Wade is describing how he's living in the box apartment with nothing but the OASIS suit and has no life outside of OASIS, plus how basically the entire world is using OASIS to ignore how massively screwed everything is. Not just all entertainment, but the entirety of the economy is 100% virtual! And it's not even based on contemporary culture. It's historic culture! It's all backwards looking! Everyone everywhere is using OASIS to escape the real world and *nobody* is putting any effort into the real world. That's a really unique and clever idea for a dystopia. You have direct access to a utopia, but it's not real. It really says some pretty deep things about reality, fiction, progress, the environment, the value of human labor, and the human condition. It even gets to the end and Wade has the choice to end OASIS and force the whole world back into the real world. To end the dream and force the world to fix the planet. But it doesn't actually investigate any of that, or try to say anything about it. In spite of all the work that it does on theme dropping, it doesn't pull the trigger on it. It just ignores it and says OASIS sure is cool. I mean, *come on*, Wade's avatar is even called Parzival, named after the knight who comes closest to the holy grail only to fail at the final trial because he doesn't ask the Fisher King the question. ***WHAT THE EVER LIVING FUCK, ERNEST.***!<

Second, I swear that the book >!foreshadows that Ogden Morrow is secretly Nolan Sorrento, or that Aech or Art3mis is secretly an IOI agent, or that Morrow was going to steal the prize. And, again, the book just *doesn't pull that trigger* and flip Wade's world upside down. Everybody is exactly who they appear to be, and nobody is fooling the reader or Wade. Boring as fuck. Like, holy shit, can you imagine of Morrow *was* Sorrento? What an opening for a series! Everything the protagonist valued or thought was true, and every value that he believed in, just got turned around on him. What does he do now?!<",da_chicken,2021-10-28T23:16:09Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,18

qhq6a4_21,qhq6a4,"It's books like Ready Player One that make me less upset at the author and story and more upset that we live in a world in which it did well. This book is the kind of self-indulgent hero fantasy that someone would write, putting themselves in the middle of a world completely suited to their interests and have them come out on top as it is designed specifically for them. Where the real problem is is that modern culture has become so obsessed with this consumer-driven era of the past and detached from reality that they will see themselves in this hero worship story. Wade Watts beats a level by knowing every line of the Holy Grail? I know ever line of the Holy Grail! That's why RPO is honestly kind of a perfect book for this modern era, it came out right when we as a society were at the height of this 80s nostalgia and when all of this media was readily made available at everyone's fingertips all of the time. You ask why people in the 2040s would be obsessed with John Hughes instead of fixing the famine problem? Why did we just have a whole generation of people argue that ""they ruined my childhood"" when another money grabbing sequel is made rather than care about climate change or poverty? They are obsessed with the same hero worship that Cline is and that he provided them in this book, giving them a world in which caring about all this stuff actually pays off instead of being a meaningless obsession.",,2021-10-29T03:43:40Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,21

The biggest problem with Ready Player One is that it struck a nerve with enough people that it became a part of the zeitgeist for a minute. A lot of people who got swept up in that moment, or who are catching up late like yourself, have a cognitive bias that there’s supposed to be some meaning or gravity to it that simply isn’t there. Then they get upset that it isn’t the thing they assumed on some level that it would be.

qhq6a4_35,qhq6a4,"Ready Player One was released in 2011. This was a time were nerds and manchildren were viewed with VERY rose-tinted glasses. Incel-estique men were seen the way they saw themselves, as victims. This entire manosphere was seen in this vacuum, outside the political arena. You know, those loveable, innocent nerds from Big Bang Theory.

Then, in 2016, Gamergate hit. The core of this political movement was the rumor that a woman who had made some games was, according to blogposts by her ex, sleeping with video game reviewers in order to harvest positive reviews. Pretty much everything about the movement screamed extreme right, and gradually, people began to grasp that the nerdish longing for the past history wasn't just innocent nostalgia, but also pretty reactionary. There were a kind of embarassing overlap betwen lovable nerds and neo nazis.

In 2018, the movie adaptation of Ready Player One premiered. A lot of people got inspired by the movie to pick up the novel, and they read it through the lenses of the Gamergate movement. Also, all this pop-culture nostalgia had gotten pretty stale.",Kasper-Hviid,2021-10-28T18:50:04Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,35

I googled it to see if there was any fan art, and learned that Ernest Cline actually owned that car, in real life. *Before* he wrote the book.

That's when I realized that Ready Player One is pure self-insert fanfic. Wade's perspective *is* Cline's perspective. The entire book is pure, self-aggrandizing wish fulfillment.

It's not that they don't appreciate their childhood, it's that they hate the book. I also know lots of Millennial nerds who are not at all ignorant of the nostalgia of the 70s and 80s and it's not that they don't appreciate the time frame. In fact, a lot of them enjoy it. They just hate the book.

I think the thing that bothers me most about all the discussions about Ready Player One is how this is always the counter argument. Always. There's never another one. People will bring up legitimate criticisms of the book, and the response always boils down to ""Well were you expecting Kafka?!"" It's such a cop out. Things don't have to be aiming to be masterpieces for you to criticize them. We can criticize them for aiming at a shit pile.

I don't mean to try to change anyone's mind who enjoyed the book. If you can read it and look over the horrendous writing, the passive sexism, Wade's tiresome whining and flat character, and all the other legitimate criticisms and just enjoy the dump of references, then more power to you.

qhq6a4_56,qhq6a4,"I mean I kinda peg it as the guy version of Twilight. Which some my take as a deep criticism but I don’t, I honestly think Twilight got way too much cultural backlash.

Both are pretty straightforward B-level wish fullfillment self insert novels. The sort that putter around, get a moderate amount of success and absolutely nobody cares because it only nibbles at the edge of the pop culture consciousness. Like Eragon: fantasy, dragons, basically the plot of Star Wars. Was entertaining enough but didn’t really penetrate in as some big landmark franchise. Its just there.

RP1 and Twilight had the misfortune of becoming bigger than they really should be. You get into the wider mainstream and people/critics/society starts *expecting*  things from a piece of media….that neither of those two series/movies could or should deliver. Hence the winging about what “this means” for a society or people that enjoy this type of stuff.

Have fun with it, understand not all the themes of the book are probably applicable to your life. Enjoy it for what it is. Its fine.

EDIT: and for what its worth I *could not* finish Ready Player One. And I also only finished the first *Twilight* because it was assigned in a “bad book club” I was in on my middle east deployment, though book 3 and 4 were schlocky enough to turn your brain off and enjoy the absurdity. Actually my favorite Navy memory is about a dozen guys sitting around watching some advanced copy of Breaking Dawn Part 2. >!They get to the part with the awesome fight scene that turned out to have happened in a dream and our guy Jamal just goes “OH HELL FUCKING NO. THEY MAKE THIS FUCKING SHIT ASSED MOVIE FUCKING GOOD FOR 5 WHOLE FUCKING MINUTES AND TAKE IT AWAY? THAT MOTHERFUCKA JUST OPENED UP A PORTAL TO HELL WITH LAVA. AND THEY WERE THROWING THOSE BITCHES IN IT AND ITS ENDS UP ALL A FUCKING DREAM? WHAT A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT, I GOT ALL INVESTED. I WANNA BINGE WATCH ALL 3 BLADE MOVIES JUST TO WASH OUT THE TASTE.” - paraphrased because he actually droped like….4 N-Bombs in there.

z6d9al_22,z6d9al,"I will say that, at the time the book was written(early 00s, right?) nerd culture was still heavily dominated by exactly what you describe. You weren't a *true* nerd unless you had all the trivia in your head, and could produce it on demand. We *all* knew a [Comic Book Guy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/79/The\_Simpsons-Jeff\_Albertson.png/220px-The\_Simpsons-Jeff\_Albertson.png), and gatekeeping was constant.

I think of Ready Player One as a curious time capsule, but not of the 80s so much as the 00s. You had the constant need to prove your nerd cred, you had your manic pixie dream girl reward, you had your(going off what others have said in this thread, as I don't remember these elements myself but it has been many years) hardcore atheism and your casual mis-appropriation of japanese culture...the layers of cultural nostalgia are interesting to think about.

I think that what entertainment value the book had for me has been spoiled though. See, the main character is...kinda icky. As a nerd who's a woman, I knew his type well back in the day. I had to tiptoe very carefully around them, lest I be a) ejected from the space, or b) hit upon incessantly. Honestly, a lot of the time I just pulled the same maneuver his best friend did, where I let everyone assume I was a guy. It was easier. But it's one thing to read a book about a character who is that way because the author is writing nerds as they exist(again, unintentional period piece), and another thing altogether to read a book about a character who is that way because the author himself is that way.",Alaira314,2022-11-29T08:06:10Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,22
gil64c_1,gil64c,"I read through RP1 around 5 years ago at the insistence of the best friend of the woman I was dating at the time.  


What I remember most about my read through is just how *close* it comes to being interesting so many times.  I found the concept of the stacks where Wade lives to be absolutely intriguing, and I was gripped by how >!IOI begins assassinating the players in real life!<.  


I wish Mr. Cline would have spent more time focusing on the society these people grew up in.  It could have given much more context to the escapist vibe of the story--we certainly all could understand escaping into fantasy from an awful life situation.  Instead, the novel is filled with trite sterile lists of old video games and ultimately uninteresting characters with absolutely no meaningful development.  


That said, I understand why it was popular.  There was a surge of popularity in nostalgia at the time.  Nintendo had just made legal emulation popular in the mainstream with the Wii.  Indie video game creators were embracing older ways of making games as the scene was in its infancy.  


These years also saw films like ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and ""Pixels"" as well as video games such as ""Retro City Rampage"" that mostly marketed themselves on being chock full of things you probably remember from your childhood, but not really much more than that (at least as far as the nostalgic elements go.  You may enjoy these pieces of media, but the nostalgia factor is just there to remind you of things in the past).  


Ready Player One definitely falls into the latter category.  You may or may not like the story, but its nostalgia does very little to contribute to the plot.",Uejji,2020-05-13T05:57:21Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,1
gil64c_2,gil64c,"His follow-up novel ""Armada"" was somehow vastly worse.  I bought it in Europe to read on the beach because it was the only pulp sci-fi novel the bookstore had in English.  I didn't even know it was the same guy when I bought it.  They're also making it into another tent-pole movie because of the last one.

I honestly felt embarrassed for him to put his name on it.  You'd think maybe having become a big success he'd have spent a little time on his craft or gotten better help from an editor or something, but it's almost a regression in writing which I know seems impossible but he really outdoes himself.

If you thought the pop-culture references were bad in Ready Player One, in ""Armada,"" they aren't given a meaning by proxy of some eccentric game developer, they're given meaning based on global conspiracy.

Imagine if the ""alien technology is secretly behind our technology"" conspiracy's core concept was extended to apply to every shitty ""nerd cliche"" pop-culture thing you can list.

All this pop-culture stuff can have a positive effect when it inspires action in real life.  If you watch Star Trek, and you go invent an iPad or a talking computer in real life or whatever to realize that dream it gave you, that's a good thing.

But if you're just actually a loser who didn't follow the examples given, and instead retreated into the pedantry and minutia of fantasy worlds, then your fixation on them hasn't been positive for you.

The 80's schtick is just contrived enough to work because, hey, the obsessive who built the Oasis was also an overly focused nerd whose life was waaaaaay out of balance.

Once you've accepted those premises the plot works pretty well.  The background dystopia with how disinterested the populace is in the real world, and how the main character becomes a shut-in obsessive to try and complete the quest after setbacks caused by his personality and immaturity are both good use of the background world building.

Plus, as alluded to in the paragraph above, Percival's motivations and priorities change significantly in the book, he has a huge character arc.

gil64c_7,gil64c,"Did it ever occur to the OP that the answer to the question about why some people are nostalgic about the 80s, or whether nostalgia for the 80s can be legitimate, is something ineffable that might be difficult to grasp if one hadn’t actually lived through the that time? often times with the accoutrement of nostalgia, we are trying to surround ourselves with things that remind ourselves of other things that are difficult to put into words. like keeping something that produces an odor that reminds you of a different time. It’s the zeitgeist of the time that you’re trying to remind yourself of not the object. People who experience real nostalgia, do so because they really experience something in the first person.

If you can’t understand someone’s nostalgia, perhaps you were there but didn’t experience the same things. Or maybe you’re a millennial who doesn’t really even have an experience of the 80s at all. Whatever the reason, you certainly seem to be challenged with empathy for people who actually have an emotional connection to that time.

Or maybe you did live through the 80s, and it was just a really bad awkward time for you. That’s fine. It’s obvious that *Ready Player One* is very solipsistic, very autobiographical, and and attempt to externalize what, for at least this one author, were things that held deep value to him and formed his identity.

I can’t help but notice that the tone of this review is, for lack of a better term, very angry. I think the worst part about this whole situation isn’t Earnest Klein’s story, or his use of nostalgic references which may be signposts for entire ideas lost on the outgroup, or even his trying to mainstream nerd culture. It’s your rage over his creative output that’s most eyebrow raising.

Does it really call for the level of vehemence here? Great, so it didn’t resonate with you. Move on. You’re not asking us for help here struggling with a difficult book. You’re just ranting about how much you hate it. Also, I don’t understand the point of attempting to character assassinate the man.

Just like all creative artistic output, our reaction upon consuming it says as much about us as it does about the person or group who produced it.",eGregiousLee,2020-05-13T16:29:33Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,7

gil64c_20,gil64c,"I never read the book but if it's anything like the movie then no thanks.

Anybody who knows even a sliver of economics knows that the ending is shit. The Oasis set up a new digital currency that affected the real life economy. Imagine relying on a digital economy made by somebody that's already dead and the next person to make a decision on it hasn't been chosen yet and none of the tests show they can manage finances or economics. This was begging to be abused by the bad guys who essentially did just that through digital slavery. If the creator of the Oasis really wanted to make it a form of escapism for the world to enjoy then it would have been open-source. Instead, now people are essentially stuck in the digital purgatory of a dead man that will never expand or innovate unless the next tyrant deems so.

And what does our tyrant erm I mean gallant hero, Wade, do? Ban the Oasis two days a week. What a despicable thing to do. We start the story with the main character using the Oasis to escape shitty real life and would even find love through the Oasis but now he's robbing people of that same enjoyment. Let's be real, the only reason a virgin teenage boy with a new girlfriend would ban video games is so he doesn't have to worry about try-hard gamers outgrinding him...pRoTaGoNiSt Is NoT gReEdY, oKaY?

Just imagine you work overtime all week and come home wanting to unwind and relax with a few games only to have that day off to be the day banned from using the Oasis.

Before I get the pseudo-intellectuals that the ending was really profound by addressing internet addiction, that's wrong. If the story you tell is saying addiction is bad then you shouldn't market that story on addictive elements. Its abundantly clear the story heavily relies on pop culture references. Probably too many for most people to catch therefore only the ones who have addictively seen or played all these pop culture references will notice them all. The story is appealing to those nerdy people and then it comes back and tells them ""get a life."" After seeing the ending of Ready Player One I couldn't help but think of is the South Park Guitar Hero episode where the game insults them for setting an all-time record. Wade essentially did to all the gamers that helped in him the final battle what Guitar Hero did to Stan and Kyle in South Park.",Grey_Kn1ght,2020-05-13T11:32:04Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,20

101k2qd_1,101k2qd,"So first off: the book was never meant to be read outside of its target audience. Nonetheless that target audience shouted about it from the rooftops and recommended it aggressively to everyone, failing to understand that very few people would be interested in a book that spends nearly a full page listing fictional universes.

Then Gamergate happened.

People rapidly realized that white male nerds were not a minority that needed to be catered to, and that the self-identification as one was adopted by a lot of problematic people who gatekeep their ""nerd"" culture. It would be one thing if Ready Player One did not reflect this problematic mindset, but it absolutely does. RPO showcases a universe in which whoever knows the most about obscure nerd trivia wins, no cleverness or ingenuity is necessary, just the gathering of facts. Cline ironically shows no genuine love for any of the material he is covering, just an encyclopedic urge to list it and document it and remember it. Whoever is the biggest nerd deserves to own the Oasis, and some of the twisted strategies that Wade uses to ultimately complete the contest >!(his disgusting suit, after he gets rich) !<are not addressed with any kind of criticism.

It is ultimately a wish-fulfillment fantasy for a group that gets wish-fulfillment fantasies *a lot* in media. RPO distinguishes itself by going further, shamelessly so and on a level almost indistinguishable from self-parody. Then Cline's other books came out, which sucked regardless of your biases.

Then [this happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/justneckbeardthings/comments/6pfmim/this_incredible_poem_by_ready_player_one_author/), and we were all forced to ask ourselves: ""How could the RPO author write something so cringey?""

101k2qd_4,101k2qd,"So you're asking about the flip specifically I think, well first and foremost criticism of ready player one didn't appear out of nowhere.

It was a position that has been held by many for a long time. Many more did like it though and I remember it being recommended to me enthusiastically.

My opinion on it is negative but that isn't really part of your question.

I think it's a book that succeeded in a very specific niche of nerd-dom and effectively broke containment. Outside of it's specific circle it's strengths become weaknesses.

This can be true of stories of many different genres.

A common example is Anime fans often recommend things with aggressively abrasive qualities to the uninitiated because they're blind to them.

To enjoy Ready Player One, it's particular brand of fan service is going have to be something you're into and that only works for a very specific audience.

But even if you are into them, it is very much a crutch, without them the story is an incredibly by the numbers young adult novel.",CollinsCouldveDucked,2023-01-03T04:10:19Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,4
101k2qd_5,101k2qd,"Honestly Ready Player One is exactly like Twilight. It’s fantasy, wish fulfilment for a certain demographic with fine/mediocre prose and surface level content. The difference is RPO is for a cishet male audience, and as a result people get upset that others don’t like it. Twilight fans know what it is, and accept it’s not for everyone. Likewise, geek culture is predicated on seeing their interests as superior to others, usually due to them perceiving it as ‘niche’ (RPO is largely about this phenomenon). As a result, before it became mainstream and people critiqued it, fans had assumed it was some amazing work of fiction. 

Same thing happened with Twilight- fans (myself included) were surprised that others did not like something they loved over time, they accepted this. RPO should go the same way, but the difference is the target market tends to be more obnoxious in justifying their interests as superior (see reactions to Spider-Man:NWH and the Oscars last year).

101k2qd_11,101k2qd,"There are definitely quite a few reasons, but for me the changing attitude towards it seems closely tethered to the changing attitude toward ""geek"" culture. RPO came out ten years ago at the height of several nerdy pop-culture properties. Avengers was a hot new commodity, Game of Thrones was the biggest thing on TV, and 80s nostalgia was huge (though it would arguable peak in 2016 with the release of Stranger Things). Being a geek was ""cool"" in that it was the consumer identity that was being catered to by the largest entertainment companies in the US.

Then a lot of things happened that changed that. Online geek culture was fractured by culture war bullshit like Gamergate and has never returned to that unified consumer block that it once was (but that's way to long to get into here). Culturally, we moved past 80s nostalgia to 90s nostalgia and a lot of the properties highlighted in RPO weren't cool anymore. And a lot of the big geek properties either ended (Game of Thrones) or stagnated (Marvel) and suddenly it was no longer cool to be big fans of them. 

The irony is that Ready Player One was written as a time capsule of eighties nostalgia but now it feels distinctly dated to the 2010s, when being into geek ephemera was something to be proud of. Wade Watts is a protagonist for the era when listicles ranking Marvel after-credits scenes were the most successful pieces of writing on the internet.

I'll add one more thing to your list, or I guess call out something more specific: I cannot fucking stand books that treat being a fucking creep like it's romance, and reward the protagonist for it. 

As a white male nerd myself, I've known plenty of real world dudes who think this way, and they are almost universally pieces of shit. They treat their partners poorly, and they always think they are the victim.

101k2qd_28,101k2qd,"I feel like also, it was meant for a particular audience, *as it existed at a certain point in time.* That audience was white male nerds in the early '10s, which was kind of the peak of Millennials seeing the '80s as the cool retro decade and for being okay with nerd culture just being a constant IV stream of popular franchises. 

The moment nerd culture moved away from that phase, *Ready Player One* was always going to be seen as aging poorly. While back then, a lot of white male nerds were salivating at the mouth for every new MCU movie, every new Harry Potter thing, etc. Nowadays, there's a lot more franchise fatigue for long-running franchises. 

Plus, around the time the book was originally published was the height of that ""sometimes the curtains are just blue"" post on Tumblr and the train of thought that led to that post being popularised. Nerd culture was generally much more okay with entertainment just being entertainment for entertainment's sake back then, while nowadays there's more of an expectation that a nerd be able to critically examine the media they're engaging with. 

This was always going to make something like *Ready Player One* which, as you point out, puts a lot of value on encyclopaedic knowledge of nerd culture but not a lot on actually engaging with it age poorly. A book like this would have been the perfect place to actually engage with that tendency in some way, though. 

Something along these same lines is that Ernest Cline's writing was very much representative of that pop culture reference heavy style of writing that was popular in nerd culture back then. This is a style of writing that was always going to age poorly because there's some movies that will be popular at one point but will be largely forgotten five years later, or an actor that's popular one day and has a fall from grace the next. It also assumes a lot of prior knowledge on the part of the reader, so if you're not in the target audience the moment it comes out, you're gonna be left behind in a lot of ways. 

Because this writing style has largely fallen out of fashion in the decade or so since the book was published, the quality was always going to be reevaluated. I think this is one of the reasons why people tend to be a bit more critical of Andy Weir now as well: his books tend to be pop culture reference heavy, too.",FuckHopeSignedMe,2023-01-02T23:49:07Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,28

101k2qd_33,101k2qd,"Before writing Ready Player One, Ernie Cline was a slam poet that focused a lot of his material on geek culture and Gen X nostalgia in particular. Via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Cline):

>From 1997 to 2001, Cline performed his original work at Austin Poetry Slam venues. He was the Austin Poetry Slam Champ in 1998 and 2001 and competed on the Austin Poetry Slam Teams at the 1998 Austin National Poetry Slam and the 2001 Seattle National Poetry Slam. His most popular spoken-word pieces include ""Dance, Monkeys, Dance,"" ""Nerd Porn Auteur,"" and ""When I Was a Kid.""

I remember hearing ""Nerd Porn Auteur"" around twenty years ago, along with some of his other material, and at the time I thought it was pretty funny.

Now mind you, American culture was very different twenty-some years ago, as was Internet culture. Even mainstream humor at the time was relatively offensive and regularly mocked women and minorities, as seen on South Park and pretty much anything else on Comedy Central.

The average Internet geek twenty years ago was laughing at ""All Your Base"" memes, and posting on Slashdot, Kuro5hin, Something Awful or Fark. Most of them were computer geeks with above average technical ability. Social media didn't exist yet, and ""geek culture"" was still years away from becoming mainstream. And yes, the vast majority were male.

I'm pretty sure I'm perfectly correct in saying that almost no one found this ""cringe"" or offensive 20 years ago. Gen Z was in diapers -- it was still Gen X and early Millennials at this point.

He looks into a mirror, seeing himself fully. ""I should have painted the mirrors black.""

Paraphrasing but that line is so strong, the self-hatred and revulsion as he looks upon what he's become. I identify very heavily with Wade in that portion of the story. He cannot help but be who he is, but that version of him cannot aid him in his quest anymore. He needs to be a new version of himself. Which, he begrudgingly embraces.

I'm not sure that I'm qualified to comment on sci-fi. I'm pretty new to the genre, and I feel like I read it for different reasons than many people. I like science fiction that takes what we know and runs with it, giving us a glimpse of the future. I'm not very interested in how creative the author can be with creating aliens and alien worlds (sounds like fantasy to me), I want to see where they imagine the human race could end up (good, bad, or interesting).

In Ready Player One, I like how the author took existing technology (VR, internet, gaming) and created a new (virtual) way of life. This is something that could happen in our life. I think it's a cool idea, and the book gets my imagination going. I also am appreciating the plot. I have to find out what happens next!

It's not a masterpiece by any means, and I would agree with your comments about lack of character development, simplicity of the story, lack of world-building, etc.

I think the one thing that really did it for me was the whole convenient plot devices that helped aid Wade along the way. For example, playing Joust in the past that helps in advance when it comes to getting the first key, knowing how to play the guitar perfectly out of nowhere, playing a perfect game of Pac-Man, knowing every action and line of both WarGames and Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

There are books with little to no world-building or character development that are among the best pieces of literature ever written.  
There are books with awesome world-building and amazing character development that are next to unreadable because they are poorly written. 

While I wouldn't say that Ready Player One is ""magical"" or a masterpiece, the main asset of that book isn't the plot. As you said, it's extremely basic and formulaic. What makes it interesting is the way it captures the zeitgest of the early days of hacker culture, building on common tropes and stereotypical pop culture references. The story, plot, and overall setting is nothing but a frame, a tool, an excuse to cram these references and ""wink wink nudge nudge"" moments for the reader, and it's well written enough that it works, provided you're in the target audience. 

I think the book gained traction when geek chic started being ""in"", and suddenly it was fashionable to have read and liked it. I think its popularity has slightly outgrown its initial niche audience, and has probably triggered more than a few confused reviews. I think the book is a pretty fun read for anyone born between the late seventies and the early nineties who got into this kind of geek culture as a teen or young adult.

A few times, ok, but every time? He just shoehorned in extra 80s trivia just to fluff it up. 

I did finish the book, and it was definitely light entertainment, but not a great read by any means. It is written for teenagers...from the 80s.

3g1b07_5,3g1b07,"I generally walked away from Ready Player One having appreciated the experience. However! I feel like it's very targeted at gamers and probably lacking any sort of mass appeal outside of that crowd and culture. Which is what made it absolutely baffling that every name drop had to stop the story to explain itself.

For example: I think it's a fair assessment that anyone reading RPO probably knows about Zork and text adventures. At the very least, someone reading RPO is going to have a basic idea of what the text adventure genre was. For me, and anyone like me who knows Zork, the entire second paragraph of Chapter 23 was just wasted ink. That had to be at least 10 whole lines and 100 words of worthless exposition. It's the sort of thing that should have been a footnote if you're honestly worried that your audience might not be familiar enough with the reference to let it stand on its own.

Such paragraphs are littered through the book. Almost at every junction where he name drops an 80's property, concept, or idea you're going to stop for a paragraph to get a condensed Wikipedia like description of that thing. Cline honestly wouldn't have had 2/3rds his page count if he hadn't padded that sucker up with so many inline footnotes passed off as Wade's inner monologue. I don't think that a single one of those did anything for me and they certainly weren't necessary for the story (with rare exception.)

In all, the story would have been greatly improved to not have spent so much time expounding needlessly about all its references. That's probably what has me more excited about the screen adaptation than anything. It's not really possible to do that style of needless exposition on film and still have a movie that won't get you laughed out of your local community college film festival. So seeing as I liked pretty much everything about the book other than the exposition, the movie sounds like a surefire hit in my book.",darthyoshiboy,2015-08-07T10:09:00Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,5
3g1b07_6,3g1b07,"Cline's previous big credit was co-writer on the script for Fanboys, a reference-filled movie centered around 80s/90s nostalgia, pop culture, and in-jokes. His major project after Ready Player One was Armada, a reference-filled novel centered around 80s video games, sci fi tropes, and in-jokes. 

At this point, I'm not sure if Cline can actually deviate from this weird little formula. ""Write what you know,"" sure, but only to a certain point - so far, everything Cline's put out is just ""Hey, *remember when* ___?"" for 300 pages.

Ready Player One makes the adventure seem fun. The nostalgic factor was not lead by the main character, but was more brought out by the fact that the ""Willy Wonka"" of Virtual Reality's Google was a big fan of the 80s entertainment and challenged the new world in the old ways. I believe that he lost faith in the way humanity was moving and wanted to bring back some of the appreciation of the old ways. It would be the same way in real life. With every new luxury, we forget the history behind it.

In that way, I think the book wanted to portray that in our current state of affairs. How most of the younger generation today don't understand how hard life used to be before all of this new technology.

As to the rest of your points, I don't really disagree with you at all. I've mostly been speaking to it's value as a piece of entertainment rather than it's technical merits. That's kind of the crux of disagreements like this. In determining a works quality, does one place more stock in personal enjoyment (a very subjective matter), or technical competency (which is a quite a bit more objective.) They're both valid measures of quality, and whichever you give more weight to is really another matter of opinion.

baor26_1,baor26,"I enjoyed Ready Player One, the book. Was it some grand masterpiece of literature? Nope! It was a great, fun romp through my childhood, mixed with a genre I love, with a simple egg hunt (literally). I had a blast with it.

I would like to recommend some other cyberpunk novels to you, you may enjoy:

Neuromancer by William Gibson - Kind of the 'granddaddy' of the genre, never turned into a movie (thankfully, at this point), but defines a lot of the terms we still use today. All style over substance, all high-concept and glitz and glitter coating a group of horrible anti-heroes. The true essence of cyberpunk, to me. A personal fav, by far; I've named my entire network after characters, places, and things in the book. If you like it, you've got 2 more in the Sprawl Trilogy to jack into.

Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson - Glorious Stephenson at some of his best. Detailed to a fault, but super open in world that just lets your mind wander.

Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick - You've seen Blade Runner? This is what it was based on.

Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom by Cory Doctorow - Post scarcity economy... run on what amounts to Facebook Likes, with different high-profile 'groups' claiming parts of the now socially-reclaimed Magic Kingdom to make art for people to enjoy. It's as horrific as you think it is, but not in the way you think it is. Great, fast read, and [still free](https://craphound.com/down/download/) up on Doctorow's website.

That book got me out of a reading hiatus, too.

I had been reading some heavy stuff -- Russian literature, existentialism, experimental novels, etc -- and then several relatives and friends passed away, so I just couldn't read anything anymore. I just couldn't concentrate.

Finally after many many months, I loaded up *Ready Player One* on my Kindle, a book which I had originally purchased way back in 2011, long before it became a huge hit.

While I agree with criticisms of the quality of writing -- it's lacking in many areas -- at that time, it was the perfect book for me. It was easy to read, and I loved the nostalgic look back at 80s video gaming, since I grew up playing those very same games.  I remember those tips about playing Joust, and I was obsessed with text adventure games like Zork. I loved how the book talked about Japanese toys and cartoons, like the Shogun Warriors, Ultraman and more. I had those very same toys.

Exactly, I think is this part of how the big reddit backlash happened.  It was a victim of its own success.  So many people including me loved it as a fun, original, playful, well-constructed adventure.

Honestly, I primarily recall the beginning of the book, and quickly coming to hate the protagonist. After that it's mostly a blank, leaving only a vague impression of disliking everything about it. That is very abnormal for me—the vague impression part, I mean.

>my thing about ready player one is that it heavily relies on a time period less than a single generation. 

Yes, definitely. I made sure to point out that my comparison was more about a potential learning curve as opposed to scope/longevity. And I agree the WG is the far superior book - I happen to like the dystopian genre but a lot of them are focused more on the grimdark than on good sci-fi storytelling. For me, RP1 is like a candy bar while WG is more of an actual entree.

6rti7o_1,6rti7o,"My problem with the book wasn't anything to do with the characters or the plot line, but instead in regards to the author's tendency to go off in tangents about pop culture from the ""golden era"".

To me this made the book less about a quest to beat the game and thus save the world, and more about the author showing off, ""Look at all this trivia I know about decade X, and wouldn't it be cool if that knowledge could be used to save the world?""

Now don't get me wrong, on the base of it that isn't a huge problem. The base of a ""Quest to save the world using skills that society as a whole doesn't normally regard as useful"" is not a new one. I mean look at the Last Starfighter whose IMDB's tag line is ""A video game expert Alex Rogan finds himself transported to another planet after conquering The Last Starfighter video game only to find out it was just a test.He was recruited to join the team of best starfighters to defend their world from the attack."" and came out in 1984.

But let's be honest if Ready Player One were to talk about the Last Starfighter it would spend at least a couple of pages talking about how it affected the culture of the 80s when it came out, and blah blah blah. Nothing discussed in those two pages would actually advance the plot at all, and would just be the author showing off, ""Look how much I know about this movie, and I'm going to act like you've never heard of it before.

If you enjoy Ernest Cline's writing style, pick up his second book Armada about video game players who save the world.  Like most critics, Armada is not as good as Ready Player One, but it's still entertaining.

3da3q3_2,3da3q3,"About 15 years ago, I stumbled across an spoken-word comedy album called *Ultraman is Airwolf*, by Ernie Cline. (The album went missing a few years later, and I strongly suspect an ex-girlfriend appropriated it when we split. However, a quick Google search shows me it is now available as a [free download](http://www.ernestcline.com/blog/2011/12/08/the-10th-anniversary-of-ultraman-is-airwolf-now-a-free-download/). Yay!)

Because of my love for that album, I discovered a movie written by that same person a few years later called [*Fanboys*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanboys_(film\)). And, of course, it was impossible to miss the media blitzkrieg of *Ready Player One* and *Armada*. I'm so incredibly pleased to see you succeed and reach a nationwide audience like your talent deserves. But *Ultraman is Airwolf* remains - to me - as the best product you have published to date. (though, to be fair, I haven't read *Armada* yet...)

Perhaps it's nostalgia, or because I listened to the album so many times that I memorized some of the bits, or because it was the first thing that you put out that I got to hear. But your short-form comedy essays are still hilarious, and I only wish there were more. So I guess my question is: do you still write short-form comedic essays?

3da3q3_6,3da3q3,"Hey Mr. Cline,

I'm going to throw you a pretty heavy question here. Both *Ready Player One* and *Armada*, due to the increasing popularity of both books, have come under mixed literary scrutiny. In particular, a [review by Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2015/07/armada_by_ernest_cline_follow_up_to_ready_player_one_reviewed.single.html) has heavily critisized *Armada*, remarking that its plot is highly similar (possibly identical in ways) to *The Last Starfighter* and even *Ender's Game*. The review concludes with:

>Armada is ... a book-length love letter of cultural hyperlinks that refer you elsewhere but contain no meaningful content themselves. Take away the shoutouts and the plot points borrowed wholesale from far better works of science fiction, and the story in Armada doesn't just fall apart—it doesn't exist at all. It’s simply a long series of secret handshakes, designed to grant access to the most enduring and beloved fantasy world of so many aging gamers: the idea that nothing will ever be more important than the things they loved when they were young.

I know many people here don't care much about what critics have to say, myself included, but I am interested in hearing what your reaction is to the above quoted statement. 

Do you believe that your books should be viewed primarily as fun works of entertainment, designed to appeal to geek culture, or do your books possess thematic merit beyond what is superficially stated in the text through its plot and multitudinous allusions? In other words, is there a message, moral, or social critique that you are offering in your novels? What is the significance of your writing style's heavy use of references? 
What do you have to say in response to the Slate review that *Armada* appropriates the plot of other sci fi stories and is consequently unoriginal?

3da3q3_7,3da3q3,"Just finsihed Ready Player One in preparation for reading Armada as part of the /r/books bookclub and enjoyed it.


Money plays heavily in the story with IOI wanting to futher monetize OASIS; a large part of the population is poor and relying on assistance programs or shady means to aquire the funds to maintain their real and virtual lives; the prize money for finding the egg and more.


* Wade seems to be both wealthy and barely making it by the middle of the book with his high bills, low paying job, prize money, and endoresement income. Is this an inconsistancy or an impovrished 18 yearold handling finances for the first time?

* It's mentioned that GSS keeps increasing teleportation fees which sounds like an omonous bit of forshadowing that they aren't as virtuous as hoped when compared to IOI. Was this a red herring? A throw away bit of story telling to show that Wade's new wealth doesn't actually go that far? or something else?



Identity seems to be another strong theme. The characters all define a new identity of their own making in OASIS; privacy & guarding one's real name is very important; characters reject or choose not to conform to the identities bestowed upon them by birth.


* With the talks of movie adaptations and the importance of the phsyicality of the characters, are you worried about the casting or artistic decisions for the characters and their avatars? will you be part of these decisions?

3da3q3_26,3da3q3,"I LOVED your book! I worked in stereoscopic 3D/VR/Theme Park attraction design and this changed my entire perception about what the future of our world could be!  I think I may have seen you at Star Wars Celebration Orlando, but I think you were getting food, and I didn't want to be a bother! I've always SUPER regretted that!

My questions are as follows:

1.) I know it's a long shot, but after Lego Dimensions, any chance of a Ready Player One game?  Where can I sign up?!?

2.) Any plans for a sequel to the books? There was a Ron Moore TV show that delved into being connected/not being connected. Also - I loved the idea in Ender's Game that 'games' could have an impact on the real world. Any of that?

Can't wait to read more of your books!

>So regarding the recent film adapted from your novel, what are your feelings when special liberties are taken by the screenwriters and the studios? Liberties such as changing plot points, combining scenes or even changing characters for what appears to usually be just arbitrary choices.

>Also did you have any kind of involvement in the writing of the screen version for the Ready Player One? Has a script even been penned yet? Of the few book to movie adaptions that I actually like only a small handful actually had the author involved and those in particular, Gone Girl and Stardust, are exceptional adaptations of the original source.

During the sequence where Wade is living in the high-security apartment under an assumed name, it starts to get pretty dark. He becomes obsessed and overweight. Eventually he does force himself to work out and eat better, so it works out okay in the end.

3da3q3_30,3da3q3,"No questions--just a comment.

I live in central Kentucky, and until very recently worked at my local public library. Every year, we have a ""One Book, One Bluegrass"" event in April where we purchase/rent a bunch of copies of one book and encourage everyone in several counties and towns (including the state's second largest city, Lexington) to read the same book. We also host a bunch of events and programs that relate to an aspect of the book. Last year's (2014) pick was *Ready Player One*. 

I have to say, I was so excited by how many of my customers commented to me that they ""never knew they liked SciFi"" and ""would have to find more books like *Ready Player One*.""  Until I started working at a public library in central Kentucky, I don't think I really understood just how little attention science fiction gets within the general population. But *Ready Player One* definitely makes the genre accessible to people who would ordinarily only come in for the newest James Patterson or Janet Evanovitch novel. It was great to see my personal favorite genre get some love from the every-man. ",glass_hedgehog,2015-07-15T01:35:57Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,30

3da3q3_50,3da3q3,"Mr Cline,

Firstly, thank you for Ready Player One. For as long as I can remember I've had difficulty reading books. Don't get me wrong, I can read an article, or a review, a news story or even a whole wall of text on reedit, but I've always had trouble with reading an actual book. 

Ever since I was a wee child I can always remember loving games, and growing up it moved into film too. Owning all of the older consoles and the newer ones too, gaming is still part of my life. I think the thing that really grips my attention is the detail of the story telling and the visuals that film and games provide. I haven't got the most vivid imagination and books have always been a struggle for me. In an attempt to get me to read, my girlfriend purchased an autobiography of a particular someone for Christmas one year, someone that I had always been interested in. A third of the way through was the best I could do before laying it to rest. I haven't read it since. 

We recently went away on holiday and on the flight there I noticed she had Ready Player One in her bag. A 6 hour flight put me in a position where reading the first few chapters would help ""kill some time"". Boy, was I right. The way the book was written, how descriptive you were with the characters and how you brought them to life just gripped me like nothing else I had ever read. For the rest of the holiday I spent my spare time just reading Ready Player One, often reading the same page twice because of what had happened in a particular paragraph. I found myself physically gasping and shouting ""what the heck?!"" when certain events unfolded (obviously no spoilers, just in case!), something of which I've never done before with anything I've ever read. 

However, at the end of my holiday and after finishing your book I felt pretty hollow. What could I possibly read next that would grip me as much as this book did? True enough, I've ordered Armada, in the hope that the way you tell a story flows through into this new adventure, but if for some reason it doesn't grab me in the same way that Ready Player One did, then at least I found one book that I'm proud to display in my cabinet. 

Secondly, if you did, thank you for taking the time to read this. Good luck with Armada and whatever the future brings!",CMD-ESC,2015-07-14T20:11:48Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,50

My question is as follows; Ready Player One has been hailed as a book that has gotten a lot of young girls and boys interested in reading when they otherwise might not have been. Because of it's heavy video game content it has lured in a lot of teens and kids usually glued to screens.

Any chance, be it large or small of Ready Player One being a two parter or trilogy of movies? Or has the working script captured it fairly well into just one movie?

Two questions for you if you have the time...

Between RPO and Armada I noticed that you really love references to nerd culture. In RPO they make sense and really help drive the the the main story and characters. In Armada they just seem shoehorned and don't really provide any depth.What was the main basis between the references in Armada and how often they pop up? Why are so many of the references doubled down with other reference associations in the same sentence or paragraph?

For my second question (I suppose the last one counted as two), relating to Ready Player One, during the mecha battle, are all the mechs supposed to be of similar height to each other or are they sized accurately to their source material?

Also, thanks for signing [a few things for me at Comic-Con](http://41.media.tumblr.com/d4f92d612a06bdb63bb404b568df79c5/tumblr_nrd085J07W1rz40i3o1_500.jpg), they mean the world to me and a friend of mine who is trying to build his book collection back up after his family threw all of his books away.   
  

I tried to ask this at Comic-Con, but I'm afraid I got a bit tongue-tied and it sounded like I thought Armada was a Ready Player One sequel!  
I'd love to know what happens in reality in the real world in Ready Player One. It looked pretty bleak, especially economically. I've heard rumors, and it sounded like a sure thing when we spoke at Comic-Con, but I'd love a confirmation while you're here: Will there be a sequel? About when will it be released? Assuming that there will be a sequel, will it focus at least partially on the economic situation in reality?  
  
As for Armada, I'm on chapter 22. Ender's Game is mentioned more than a few times, and the book has a distinct Ender's Game feel (with Ender's story being sort of split between Zack and Xavier). I was wondering if you've read more of Orson Scott Card's books, or just Ender's Game?",SenderMage,2015-07-14T19:51:34Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,128
3da3q3_129,3da3q3,"Hi there Mr. Cline, and thank you for Ready Player One (and thanks to Wil Wheaton for recording the audio book) because if it wasn't for this book, I don't know if I would still be alive today or believed in myself enough to aspire to be a Writer and Game Designer. Being around 15 years old when the book came out, now 19, I use to listen to the audio book endlessly for a while during high school, and felt like I was similar to Wade, being poor, obsessed with older pop-culture, and feeling like an outcast of society with better friends online than IRL. Hell, I even had a crush and practically fell in love with a girl that I only knew online. I also participated in the Contest you hosted and managed to beat each gate, sadly not before the winner though...

I contemplated killing myself before I started listening to the book, and if I hadn't started it when I did, I might have gone through with it. It helped me realize that suicide wouldn't fix anything, and that if I wanted a better life, then I should try just aim to make it better. This made me seek out the more positive things that I had within my reach as well as working towards the better life, just like Wade did. So thank you very much, Ernest. I don't think I'm the only one you helped through tough times.

Now, for my two questions. Where should I start, in this day and age, with my writing? (I enjoy writing Scripts and Screenplays for shows and movies, but also do stories, so my style can be a bit unique)

3da3q3_146,3da3q3,"   I would like to congratulate you on your recent success with Armada as well as with the film adaptation of Ready Player One.  Also, thank you so much once again for visiting Sam Houston State University in November 2014.  It was an honor to meet you.  If you don't remember, my fan-fiction CALEKO was selected as the winner for the competition at SHSU in honor of your book.  I know you are a busy man, so I understand if you have missed my attempts to correspond with find out if I can somehow be involved in the Ready Player One film, and if you have any power in that matter.  As a film major at SHSU, I want to make a career out of writing, acting, and directing, and I feel as if Parzival's adventure has been the jump-start for both of us.

    Thanks to you and to Ready Player One, my fan fiction has gained interest from Texas to Brazil, as I was recently contacted by someone in South America who found my story and wanted to translate it into Portuguese.  I have also had the opportunity to speak about my fan fiction at three separate events.  I don't know if you ever had the chance to read it yourself, but if you do I would like to know your critique of it.  And like you, I do not want my involvement with Ready Player One to end on paper.  I would be honored to help carry it onto the screen as well.

I actually think there's an excellent chance that many of the pop culture artifacts that appear in the book will also appear in the film, because Warner Bros and Steve Spielberg are the ones making the adaptation. WB already owns the licenses to a lot of the music and movies mentioned in the story, and they also  recently made the LEGO movie.  And Mr. Spielberg is responsible for getting the clearances for Who Framed Roger Rabbit? So I'm hoping that something similar happens with the RPO movie.

And yes, I couldn't be more excited that Steven Spielberg is making Ready Player One. The last time he adapted a first novel it was JAWS. It's a dream come true!",iamernestcline,2015-07-14T21:11:23Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,150

And yes, I did replay certain games and movies while I was writing RPO, but only to make sure I got certain details correct. For example, I rewatched the scenes in WarGames that appear in the book to refresh my memory. I also used MAME to jump to the final Pac-Man split screen, to make sure I described playing through it properly.

3da3q3_152,3da3q3,"> What thrills/concerns do you have regarding the upcoming film adaptation of Ready Player One?

It's all thrills now, really, since I'm blessed enough to have one of the most successful directors in the history of cinema adapting my novel.
I will confess that when I think about the possibility of John Williams scoring the film, my brain starts to shut down.

> With which of your Ready Player One characters do you most identify?

I try my best to get under the skin of all of my characters while I'm writing them, but Wade and Halliday are probably the two I identify with the most. I'm not nearly as good at programming or video games as either of them though.

> Are there any memorable experiences you can share from the creation of Fanboys?

I have a small non-speaking role in Fanboys. I play one of the Star Trek fans in Seth Rogen's posse in Riverside, Iowa and also in the Vegas scenes. I got to tackle Hutch, the character based on me, and I was also in a scene with William Shatner! But the best moment for me was probably when I got to go to Skywalker Ranch to help with the final sound mix on the film. I think I'm the first Star Wars fanboy in history to ever break in to Skywalker Ranch by writing a movie about doing that very thing.
You can read a lot more anecdotes from the making of the film on my blog: ernestcline.com/blog

> What are your own all-time favourite video games?

Black Tiger and Battlezone. Those are the only two coin-op arcade machines I own, and each one played a role in inspiring RPO and ARMADA.

> How do you think the increasing popularity of Virtual Reality will affect us?

It's going to change everything! Not just gaming, but also movies, television - even the way you record your graduation or wedding. It's a very exciting time.",iamernestcline,2015-07-14T21:37:06Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,152

3da3q3_162,3da3q3,"I want to agree with you but something is nagging and telling me, no, nothing embodies the era better than WarGames. The zero-player-game sequence is one of the most important moments in cinematic history for expressing the paranoia, anxiety and existential dread of the Cold War in a suspenseful, visually impressive and yet terrifyingly relatable way. For me, the music played during that sequence is up there with Psycho's strings or Kill Bill's Twisted Nerve for tension. And the payoff is some of the defining lines of geek and game culture! I think that's the most important thing though, it's not only the right era and the right sort of story, it's specifically *about games* and the idea of certain games being as important and meaningful enough to change lives, which is a huge part of RPO. The only similar film that I can think of is *Tron*, and that's Disney. 

It'd be sad to not have it in Ready Player One, but I suppose it isn't *strictly* crucial. Just thematically most right. Very few of the games and movies referenced are actually critically important, in that their content doesn't matter so much as their era and context. Black Tiger could be any of dozens of similar titles from the era - Pac-Man could just as easily be Donkey Kong, although the former has the more memorable and absolute Kill Screen.",,2015-07-15T06:45:25Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,162

People often dismiss it, saying it makes too many references to old games, movies, etc. and that it relies on nostalgia readers have. But the story would be just as fun and entertaining if every single game, song, and TV show were fictitious.

As for the line about movie stars and reality TV personalities, it's not a stretch at all to think those will be the only people who could get elected in the near future. Half of the last four Republican presidents fit into that category, of course, and another rose in politics because of his family.

You basically know the plot of Armada.

Armada feels so very much like that movie that there's a line in the book about the main character feeling like he was in the movie (or something like that).

oq5zqd_24,oq5zqd,"In my opinion, not really. To be clear, I don't see that comment as denigrating to the readers or fans of the book. You can like a bad book, but there is a huge difference between liking books that are bad and not being able to recognize the offensive parts of books.

I'm not talking about people who like Ready Player One specifically, this applies to lots of media. I have plenty of friend who are from exactly the time period that book was written for. They know it's hot garbage, but for them reading it is like having your home town mentioned in a movie. (Assuming you don't live in like New York or LA) It is a fun little ""hey! I know that!"" 

However,  there is also a subset of the people who don't seem to recognize that Ready Player One also has some SUPER offensive shit in it. The easiest example is just the way it treats its female characters. There are actual passages of the book that go something to the effect of, ""She was <right-click, thesaurus, select fancy word/less mean word for unattractive> but I didn't see her that way. I thought she beautiful. Why didn't she like me?!"" 

The subtext here is that she owes him something because he's nice to her. Never mind that the in narrative character of this girl is smart and reasonably successful and doesn't need that shit. Worse yet is the book rewards that pathetic bullshit. The main character ""gets the girl.""

If you read that and thought it was cool and how relationships work, I mostly think your a crappy person. 

And to make matters worse, Ernest Clive (sp?) actually seems to think this way. If the book was satire I would almost respect it, but from the stuff he has put online he's just a real gross dude. 

To use a different example with a different author. When I was younger I really enjoyed the Sword of Truth series. I thought it was cool and fun. As an adult I was able to more well recognize that Terry Goodkind has some real stupid ideas about philosophy, and he was sometimes subtly, sometimes not so subtly, using his books to cough up his ideas. Now if you asked if I read I don't say I liked them, I say they were entertaining. Because aside from entertainment, they have little value. 

In both cases, if you tell me liked the book, I'm not gonna assume anything about you. I'll probably ask what you liked. If you say they were fun, cool. If you say you thought RP1's main character was a cool guy... I'm probably gonna think less of you. 

Granted you shouldn't do it from zero, but if folks say they like a book you find highly offensive, it's ok make some judgement calls about them. I would suggest asking what they found liked, so you know... But that's me. I'm also fine with folks who don't have time for people who like RP1, or any other book.",Aksius14,2021-07-23T20:33:00Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,24

I would say something like The Breakfast Club would definitely still resonate with the characters from Ready Player One. Singing in the Rain isn't really comparable to a sensation like Star Wars, Aliens, or Terminator. 

Also, people do still dig into the 50s today. A lot of people love black and white movies and oldies. Most people still know who Elvis is. Movies and shows are made about the 50's (and earlier) all the time.",julianwelton,2021-07-24T00:52:29Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,26

291xuu_18,291xuu,"I can honestly say that I have never read a negative review of the book. I read the book following the large number of people on this subreddit suggesting it.

Who was the third main character? The best friend? I honestly couldn't say. I think that right there is problematic. What is his role in the book other than that of plot device and deus ex machina?

To me, the characters all fell flat. Maybe you read more into who they were on your own? It's easy to do that, especially when they are written that way to allow the reader to simply place their own identity into that of the protagonist.

The same was done in The Hunger Games books. The main characters each have one singular identifying character trait . Katniss is super brave. Peeta is really nice, you guys. And third dude plays the role of love triangle plot device.

Some writers, looking for the largest audience possible will do this purposely to simplify things and allow the readers to easily relate. See: the original Star Wars. Others will leave the characters flat simply due to their own poor writing choices. See: Star Wars Episode One.

Which method is used in Ready Player One? It's hard to say. I'd like to give the author the benefit of the doubt and say it was intentional, although I don't think he was successful at it. The book was entertaining enough though to keep me from stop reading it. 

Just because you enjoy something doesn't mean it can't have major faults. And you know what, if they are the same criticisms that come up every time the book is discussed, maybe they have some merit at least for discussion purposes.

Ready Player One might scratch one narrow itch for the aging male demographic, but the thing is... we have porn. We already have a maximum-sex-level escape readily available to us at all times. RPO is filling in a gap, whereas Fifty Shades may have been doing the traditional double duty of romance novels (i.e. both sexual and fantastical escape simultaneously.)

Honestly, it's really hard to take RPO seriously - even setting aside the shitty writing and trite plot - because of the distinct *lack* of sex. It should be everywhere. The whole novel should be absolutely filthily drenched in it. Given the novel's specific conceit, it wouldn't have even been all that unrealistic (in context of the world it created,) unless of course the author had started inserting tons of sex into the *non*-Oasis parts of the book.

James uses simple language because she's borderline plagiarizing the Twilight series.) But Cline's book is objectively a better work.

The writing is really really lengthy with redundant information. I read some books in which the author provide a lot of ""useless and red-herring"" info, but it make you engaged more into the character. Ready Player One is just wikipedia here and there, really really bland and tasteless.

Just compare it with Da Vinci Code instead, both authors are not that magical and romantic with their wording and storytelling. They are all about info and knowledge. Their main characters step aside for their story building based on information. But Dan Brown's book makes me feel the story alive, and... well... the other book make me feel bored.

But I believe that Steven Spielberg can make an interesting movie out of this; he is good when he want to tell me a story in a world he build.

I happen to like the futuristic description of how people are stacking trailers and renting out sleeping space in laundry rooms as the world becomes overcrowded. I enjoyed the vision of everyone entering VR and going to school, being able to order food, do everything online (which is where were heading - just look at this conversation - I don't think it will be too long before we are all looking at avatars). A lot of the things you do online in the book are just like online games, having to pay for upgrades, trade with others, win prizes. I don't think the concept of the inventor and owner of the Oasis giving it away is that far of a reach, nor the chase by the government trying to control it (much like targeted ads in Google and Facebook and such). It reminds me more of an undated version of Willy Wonka, inviting in someone to be his successor. 

I liked it for the riddle aspect, needing to find clues to move on. I enjoyed the fact that online friends met in real life. I loved the 80s references as that is my era and it made me feel like a kid again. 

It took me about 6 or 7 hours to read. It was a fun and quick. Which is what you need sometimes.

86yd6z_50,86yd6z,"Just because someone wanted to say something, and they chose not to write a political pamphlet or article, doesn't mean they were simply writing a story for entertainment purposes. 

Great fiction generally has many ideas impeded into it, and, in order to dig them all up and understand them, it requires participation from the reader. This is important because it gives the reader a deeper understanding of the given topics since **they** have to put in the work.

Which do you think would have more of a lasting impact on a reader unfamiliar or opposed to a given topic? A comprehensive article on the topic or a fiction story that expresses the idea not only in it's narrative, but also in it's language. 

I think it is the latter because I believe fictional stories can make daunting, unconformable, or even foreign ideas digestible for people. 

I would say 99% of people don't read for fun. That is an exaggeration; however, I would say that the majority of people read for fun, but that majority isn't 99%. 

Reading for entertainment is not necessarily a bad thing, nor is only looking for books that are entertaining, but I think it is disingenuous to suggest that is the main reason, or even only reason, people write books.

When Ernest Cline sat down to write ""Ready Player One"", I am sure his thoughts were to write a fun and entertaining book that could take people's minds of their day, but I would not say the same thing for Ralph Ellison: considering the subject matter, which is an uncomfortable one for many and a topic people avoid, not seek, when looking to relax and be entertained, I would say he did not sit down and think the same thoughts as Ernest Cline. 

If we also consider that what happens in the book was likely, or even definitely, things he experienced in his life, I think it is fair to say that his goal was not to write an entertaining nor fun story. 

That is the only point I am trying to make. We may not write for the same argument, but I do hope you can at least see my side of things.

Neither. I mostly just try to make it the book I would most want to read.

Part of me wants to wait until VR is at Ready Player One levels, plug myself into the OASIS, and never leave lol.

Ever since I've been a kid I've found the idea of virtual reality just so insanely exciting. There is a British sci-fi comedy show called Red Dwarf that had some really great episodes involving virtual reality (Better Than Life from 1988 and Gunmen of the Apocalypse from 1993) and I loved the 1999 movie The Thirteenth Floor. Admittedly all these examples are fraught with peril lol but the idea is just so irresistible to me.

At the moment we're so far off the OASIS and virtual story quests with NPCs that the incentive to stay online and plugged in after this is all over just isn't that high. People will mostly go back to how things were before, because Zoom and Houseparty and the rest of it are still poor facsimiles of actual social interaction.

When we can reach out and stroke virtual dogs or hold a loved ones's hand in our virtual reality worlds, things will change dramatically, but we're not there yet. In the meantime I am just saving up for that technology lol because let's face it, I am probably just going to try to plug myself into the wild wild west and never leave lol.",breakfastinthemornin,2020-04-02T12:04:49Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,3

ftfneg_12,ftfneg,"The book and movie are pretty different from one another. The general plot of the movie is still the same but characters and events are too different from the book. I would say that the movie modernizes the book. The movie uses mostly references to modern pop culture like twitch and video games like halo rather than the 80's references of the book. Since it's only two hours it feels incomplete and it skips so much of the book.

I wouldn't say the book is bad just that the Ernest Cline isn't a good author. He uses references to video games and movies as a crutch for his descriptions. As you get closer to the end the amount of references thrown at you just becomes asinine. At first I thought the reason was because this is how the character saw the world but if you read his other book, Armada, you understand that this is just how he writes. Others have pointed this out as well. I still recommend reading since it's a fun little adventure that brings up some interesting questions about relationships and possibilities in vr.

I always recommend to people to watch the movie first and then read the book of any series since the book is generally better and more ""full"" than the movie. This is especially true for Ready Player One.

I have greatly enjoyed the books but I must warn that as the author is Russian there are some cultural differences. First of all they tend to be on the misogynistic side of the spectrum, which I personally find disappointing. Also, though they dont go into too much detail I have a few times detected a few elements of homophobia. Lastly the portrayal of some other races tends to be a tiny bit on the racist side. Americans are ruthless and imperial, Chinese are dedicated hard working but unimaginative, Russians are more well rounded, but the author is still overly generous with the power of their family structure and education and creativity.

>***Ready Player One*, by Ernest Cline**  

>Expected Score: 7/10  
>Actual Score: 3/10  

>**Good points:**  

>* It's an easy read, and if you're looking for a throwaway action story it's at least a more interesting premise than your average Dan Brown novel, even though it effectively just replaced the Bible with the D&D Players' Handbook.
* The worldbuilding is heavyhanded, but pretty well done. There are times when OASIS feels a lot more real than the people inside it.
* At one point Cline says (the cynic in me suggests 'not on purpose', given how obviously everything else in the novel is signposted), 'My bullet bill this month was going to be huge.' Stealth videogame puns still get a laugh.

>**Bad points:**  

>* If you've ever wondered what peak Gary Stu looks like, you've found it. Imagine a world where a shut-in with a completely unhealthy addiction to all aspects of geek culture (read the description of *anyone* who comes out of the OASIS system; other than the girls, they're all fat/pimply/greasy-haired/a weakling) can not only get the girl -- remarkably easily, in fact -- but also finish the novel a multibillionaire. And what does he have to do in order to get this? Oh, only just what Cline's audience (and Cline himself) have been doing themselves all along. *A winner is you!*
* The scene where Wade puts the moves on Art3mis in the chatroom is some seriously cringeworthy shit -- but it's all OK, because three paragraphs later she's his 'pseudo-girlfriend'. Still, despite being a pasty, overweight shut-in who *freely admits to cyberstalking her*, he feels the need to inform her that he's a 'nice guy'. Really. He swears.
* 'Are you a woman? And by that I mean are you a human female who has never had a sex change operation?' Because despite the fact that she's only a digital representation -- as she *repeatedly* points out -- that's a step too far. What's the matter, Wade? [*Freaky-deakies need love too.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoE8ZgzaX7A)
* Art3mis is BEAUTIFUL ON THE INSIDE but FLAWED ON THE OUTSIDE. But also mostly BEAUTIFUL ON THE OUTSIDE TOO, so it's all good.
* Wade's inexplicable use of a hair removal cream in the OASIS system means that when Art3mis says on the final page that he looks 'Butt ugly', he's going to be bald as a baby and completely eyebrowless. I can't wait to see that on screen in the adaptation.
* I couldn't help but wonder whether it was planned right from the beginning that Wade's initials would spell out WOW, or if one night Cline just woke up in a fevered sweat, reached for a pencil and mumbled to himself, '*I'm a fuckin' GENIUS*... the kids are gonna love this one'. We get it. He games.
* Sweet Lord, the portrayal of the Japanese kids is racist. Like, *old-school Disney racist*. Their first few scenes are literally just them bowing, calling people '-san', and saying that people have 'no honour'. Could you imagine if Cline tried that shit with any other ethnicity? People would be going nuts. I found myself wishing that it would have turned out that the two Japanese kids were really just Japanophile nerds from some shitty little town in the middle of the USA, and we'd get a nice bit of commentary about how the whole Japan-obsessed/anime-obsessed/weeaboo culture is nothing like the reality, but no.
* Speaking of: Aech. While he gets points for economy of quota-filling, it's amazing how ready Cline is to gloss over the fact that all of Aech's horrendously brotastic dialogue comes out of a fat black lesbian (who, let's note, is only really a fat black lesbian for one scene; by the time they get back to Morrowdell there's even a point made that Wade is going to keep referring to her as 'him'). I get the feeling that Cline didn't get out much as a teenager, but surely he doesn't think that's how teenagers actually talk?
* If the 'Bad Sex in Fiction' awards accepts nominations for masturbation, the cringeworthy entry from Halliday's diary (and while we're on the subject of 'Knocking a few protons off the old hydrogen atom': a hydrogen atom only has one proton. What exactly is he doing to himself?) should have been right up there with the classics -- and that's completely disregarding the whole 'humping a lubed-up sex doll' moment. I write about sex *for a living*, and I've never felt the urge to picture Marie Curie 'discovering the little man in the canoe'. The fact that the scene comes out of literally nowhere is another tick in the wrong box.

>**Weirdest moment:**

However, nearly all of my ""reading"" is done via audiobook these days and I'm of the stern opinion that an excellent narrator (I'm looking at you Ray Porter) can make a mediocre work seem rather exceptional. As Ready Player One is narrated by Wil Wheaton, both the narration quality and the nature of the reader's body of work allowed this one to excel a bit beyond the ink and paper version.",mourninglark,2017-01-26T00:51:18Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,3

(I hadn't even played/heard of most of the oldschool stuff so I had no nostalgia-attachment... still thought it was a light-fun read)

The OP mentions things like ""Fortunately, I know the game by heart!"" etc

Isn't this a common thing in many books/movies though? The story is usually from the perspective of the ""winner""

If Ready Player One was written from the perspective of someone that didn't win, then they wouldn't have known some of the things.

If you write it from the perspective of a person that ended up beating millions of other players then it would only be logical that they would have a huge knowledge and skillset in that area.

It's like complaining that the winners of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire know all the answers

If you didn’t grow up in the 80s and experience games that were in text format or play in Atari 2600 you don’t understand. The Nintendo generation didn’t even understand what those who grew up with Atari did. It was an explanation of the origins of gaming culture, where now everyone playing games is excepted yet in the 80s it was strictly nerd culture. I think the only thing the movie got correct where the book failed was distributing the activities among the characters rather than just Wade whites doing everything himself. I really liked the book and yes near the end it was very tongue-in-cheek. But it has done the best job to explain what nerds went through in the 80s where no one else really could. It inspired me to go pick up a copy of adventure and find that Easter egg that I never found in my childhood days.

iwcqjw_14,iwcqjw,"Okay first of all, thank you for taking the time to find the relevant passages and quoting them. 

>From Chapter 2:  
 *\[...\]* this is not the behaviour of a socially well adjusted individual.

Okay I'm going to out myself here. I've done this. I've saved pictures of my crush to my phone. I'm not so sure that makes me an inadequately socially adjusted individual. I wouldn't be able to give you a breakdown of why one does this, but teenagers do lots of weird and even creepy things for reasons I'll largely attribute to just getting older. 

This is in a way even one step removed from what I'm describing because he saves pictures of her *avatar* not her. Her avatar in a way is a representation of how she wants to look and be perceived as, so admiring that is kind of like saving a picture of your crush because you think their fashion is really cool.

> From Chapter 19:

Now this is again something that I find weird, but totally understandable in context. This is a teenager who lives alone, has no real life social interactions and tons of money in a world where advanced sex robots exist.   
Wade, and by extension Ernest Cline, also distances himself from the behaviour and calls it out for what it is: *""really nothing but glorified, computer-assisted masturbation.""*

>From Chapter 20:

For all intents and purposes the oasis in the world of ready player one is basically the only ""real world"" for the characters. So in that context, how is dropping *mix tapes and notes on her palace from the air* different to writing poems on a girls facebook page or sending her love confessions through WhatsApp? How is standing *outside her palace gates for two solid hours, with a boom box over \[your\] head, blasting “In Your Eyes” by Peter Gabriel at full volume* any different to doing it in front of her real house with the neighbours watching? 

This seems like fairly usual teenage stuff to me. Fairly cliché in parts, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Does it seem a bit sketch that it was written by an adult man? Sure, but the book is basically supposed to be his   teenage fantasy, so it makes sense that these things would play a part.

I'd like to take this chance to loop back to what you wrote in the previous response. At the end of the day Wade wins because of his dedication and bravery. He completes his heroes journey, evil is defeated and he gets the girl. Having a moral that proclaims that Videogames are dangerous, being a teenager in love is bad and life not being as easy as in fiction seems kind of uncalled for.

Third, the pop references are part of the plot of RPO.  They are not part of the plot of ST.  They are just the setting there.  

Fourth, the large popularity of the book attests to its entertainment value.  Tv shows are always more popular to books but No doubt they both aren’t quite popular.  

Fifth you can’t say that Stranger Things is any vast and deep treatise on growing up.  It has the depth of character of the Goonies.  That doesn’t mean it isn’t entertaining but it isn’t exactly The Count of Monte Christo.   

I got way more than five hours worth of entertainment value from RPO.  I got thirty hours worth of entertainment out of ST’s three seasons.  I have no complaints about the worth of either.

It was a literary embodiment of ~2010 internet culture (with both the good and bad), not in the specifics, but in the overall attitude and behavior. And that really was a special time to be an edgy kid on the internet. The culture just had a very different feel to it, compared to now, with the culture having become more mainstream. Ready player one so perfectly encapsulated the demographics it's was written for, I think, and that's a demographic that doesn't really exist in the same way anymore, which I feel like is why people who read it now for the first time only see the problems with it. Other litrpg books don't quite capture the same realism in behavior. This mentality might only work for people who were raised on 2000s internet though, not sure about people who had healthier upbringings. So to me, the 80s references added no value to the overall story, because that's not what was drawing me in. And it's also the same reason the movie was so awful, it just didn't feel like it had the same realism in behavior, plus some other stupid plot points.

I gave a copy to my then-boyfriend, who loved video games but didn't like reading (he was a slow reader, so it was frustrating and not enjoyable for him). he read it in just a few days, which was wild for him. it was the first book he'd finished in years and it got him excited about reading.

But you know what?  Ready Player One was EXACTLY what I needed at the time.  It was a fun and fast story that gave me the momentum I needed to branch out into other stories.

Reading it today exposes all its flaws, but if it weren't for RP1, I probably would never have found Dune, WOT, Cosmere, Dark Tower, Vorkosigan, Ursula K LeGuin, The Scar, The Culture, Planetfall, First Law, Malazan and more.

It's all treated as completely disposable media that is there just to take in and then immediately move on to the next thing. There's no substance to any of it. I don't think people should only read War and Peace, but compare to Don Quixote. Even though Don Quixote is making direct references to a certain genre of literature from the time, it is also perfectly readable and loaded with clever wordplay and irony.

i7u6al_4,i7u6al,"It's fucking terrible and anyone who says otherwise I have no respect for their opinion.  If you actually like this book you need to broaden up your reading.  Get out of genre stuff so you can at least read people that command the language.   

However, if you want to read an even bigger steaming pile of fucking shit, check out his follow-up *Armada*.  I only read it because I was in a foreign country, and it was the only sci-fi book I could find in English, and I didn't know it was the same author.

It's basically the same nostalgia-trip genre as the first one, but it manages to put Cline's toxic worldview on display even more clearly.

Without going on too long a rant, the fantasy that Cline is selling to hyper-losers, is the fantasy that a life devoted to video games and consuming pop-culture isn't actually a life wasted and in fact might make you Earth's greatest hero.  And worse than that, it acts as apologia for every failure of human society over the last 100 years, claiming that all humanity's greatest problems actually don't exist - so you were right to sit on your ass and play games while the world burns.  You weren't actually wasting your life as it turns out, you were secretly the most important human on Earth because you disconnected from society and just consumed games and movies.

And if you thought the pop-culture references in Ready Player One were bad....holy shit....

Armada feels sometimes like reading the ""begat"" section of the Old Testament.  You know ""And A begat B, and B begat C, and C begat D....""  It's just huge lists of pop-culture references that seem almost desperate.  Like something you'd read in a 12 year old's journal.  ""My Ultimate Movies List.""

I almost can't stand the fact this guy's going to be one of the richest authors on the planet selling this dog shit at a 5th grade reading level.

Ready Player One's charm is in its homage to 1980s culture. It's not stylistically unique in any way (at least in how I read it). It's an adventure in a race against an evil corporation. I don't really get anything unique in the style you'd have to express that.

Edgar Wright's strength is directing a unique style of cinematography. Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead retained a level of humor in a serious plotline due to that strength. Scott Pilgrim genuinely seemed comic book-esque because of that.

I do agree Edgar Wright is quite talented but I don't feel Ready Player One is really something that would be appropriate for his specific style of movie making.",magpie11,2014-12-08T07:38:55Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,6

I loved Ready Player One, but Armada was just trying to reuse and recycle everything that made Ready Player One cool but without an original plot or any interesting plot points happening. It was basically Ender's Game with a ton of pop culture references thrown in which ended up feeling like continuous name drops throughout the book. Not to mention there were points when he just wrote characters to be or do certain things for the sake of doing it. For example, at one point everyone starts having sex in an ""end of the world"" type of scenario, and two guys that at that point show no inclination of being homosexual are suddenly homosexual and having sex, and you can't help but feel reading it that it was thrown in as a nod to a social commentary for gay rights. 

At least Ready Player One's pop culture references made sense in regards to the plot, and the story was different and exciting. Armada felt rushed with every twist just waiting to happen. None of the characters were interesting.

Ready Player One wasn't written, it was COMISSIONED. Quite literally. The publisher wanted a video-game-specific, post-apocalyptic, middle-school-reading-level, not-terribly-long novel they could sell to gullible geeks, tweeners, and edgy kids who think reading is gay.

---------

perhaps it's my age, but I found ready player one to be a very typical dystopian novel. it's relevant to our era but I don't think it will age well. I found it was junk food because of its heavy reliance on nostalgia. 

I think it had some deep themes, but the author failed to explore them, he only skimmed the surface. Themes I would have liked to see him delve deeper into would be poverty and its effect on addiction, escapism, culture and society being linked through imagination, corporate advantages against the populace, greed in general etc. Again, all these themes are present, but I feel like he didn't explore them as thoroughly as he could have.

I feel maybe this book could have been something more memorable had it been longer or split into two parts.

Why not write a book with an enjoyable and exciting storyline that's also beautifully crafted? It seems to me that people are too quick to throw out ""fun"" books as meaningless or ""not serious literature"" simply because they're *fun.* Some really fun books (*The Dresden Files* series, for instance) have a lot of really well written and really well crafted parts to them, and are also just fun to read. I have the impression that people disregard fun literature basically because it doesn't have some sort of philosophical message that could be conveyed more completely in a three page essay than a book.

I have to say that if you think the purpose of literature is to show how skillfully you can write, you're *waaaaaay* off. True, there's no set purpose for writing, and some people do write for that purpose, but I can guarantee you that Joseph Conrad was not out just to show the world how well he could tell a story. Authors in that kind of literature are almost always trying to make a statement with their work, Conrad with ideas on colonization and ""civilized"" vs ""uncivilized"", rather than trying to keep the reader entertained. I guess the distinction comes down to fiction as entertainment vs fiction as commentary more so than ""serious fiction vs fun fiction"", which doesn't do much suggest at the purpose of ""serious literature"".

2wmap4_15,2wmap4,"I'm saying that the only discernible difference between HoD and RPO is the quality of the writing and the subject matter. In my opinion RPO's subject matter is much more interesting and HoD's writing quality is much higher. In the same way that HoD ""makes a statement"" about his ideas on colonization and civilization (which, in my opinion, are very well thought-out), RPO ""makes a statement"" about Cline's view of technology and the meaning of life. The big difference I see now is that Cline didn't necessarily explicitly intend to write about the meaning of life (it just sort of comes with a world that is so deeply invested in a virtual reality) whereas Conrad very obviously wrote about colonization and civilization. So my question becomes, ""why didn't Conrad use his amazing writing skills to write a story that is both interesting and meaningful?"" From my perspective, if you can write a story that is fun for the lay-back reader and holds up to meaningful analysis and deconstruction, *then* you've written something amazing.

And ""fun literature"" *isn't* a malicious term. It's just that if you interact with someone who has a PhD in feminist literature or whatever, and they ask you what you've just read, if you reply ""Ready Player One"" they'll reply, ""that's cute.""

I think for me the biggest issue was as someone who didn't grow up in the 80s, it felt like it skipped over a lot of stuff that would have fit in the book since it is about video games and nerdy pop culture (which I always found weird that the main character is categorized as a nerd but everyone in the whole universe uses the same game that is jammed packed with nerdy references, so isn't everyone a nerd then?).",zZTheEdgeZz,2023-10-25T14:37:59Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,1

Between being head over heels in love with Art3mis and then being dumped by her... was this months? Years? Recall that earlier the author made a specific point that Wade was limited to just a few brief excursions off Ludus, paid for by other people. 

How much time would it take to master the games, memorize all the movies, search all these planets, all while somehow masterminding a plot to get himself hired into IOI and reinforcing his apartment? And carrying on a hot and heavy romance and social life? 

And the author just drops these things in after the fact. When Wade needed something, he already had it. No mention of it prior. No foreshadowing or reasonable explanation of how he got it. It's maddening.

Edit: An actual passage from the book - ""I watched every episode of The Greatest American Hero, Airwolf, The A-Team, Knight Rider, Misfits of Science, The Muppet Show."" The A-Team had 98 episodes, 45 minutes long. That's 73.5 hours of one show. Knight Rider? 90 episodes, 45 minutes long. Another 72 hours. Airwolf? 64 hours. Etc, etc, etc. And he somehow has time do to this, presumably while going to school and sleeping. So he maybe what, has 8 hours a day (sorry, he specifically mentions 12hrs) to spend? So he's spent a month of free time, just on those three shows. And he's somehow acquired all the knowledge mentioned in the book in only five years?

Oh. And he read every book from Douglas Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, Neal Stephenson, Richard K. Morgan, Stephen King, Orson Scott Card, Terry Pratchett, Terry Brooks, etc, etc, etc...

3cz68t_1,3cz68t,"I finished Armada this morning and wrote this review in a bit of a haze, forgive the spelling/grammar errors.

> Like Armada's protagonist Zack Lightman, I grew up with a father who sowed a love for science-fiction deep into my imagination. Big-hitters like Star Wars, Star Trek and Babylon 5 were at the top of the menu, but we took on everything. Popular and obscure. Stellar and dreadful. Combined with an innate curiosity and a passion for astronomy, science fiction became far more than a Greatest Hits collection of pop references to me, it became something very real: an exotic galaxy of weird places I wanted to go; a unique texture and aesthetic.

> But author Ernest Cline isn't interested in much culture study here. Modern nerd culture has calcified around the B- and C-list celebrities that were simply around the longest, serving up decontextualized memes (""ALL YOUR BASE!""), Cinematic Universe and more Wil Wheatons, Chris Hardwicks and Nathan Fillions than you can shake a Galaxy-class starship at. Cline, who pipes around Austin, Texas in a 1981 Delorean, is more than happy to dish out the kind of cheap, knock-off nostalgia that Comic Con attendees will eat up. Theoretically.

> ""Armada"" is a poor re-wording of his passable first novel ""Ready Player One"" that doubles down on all of that book's flaws. Cline lards the first third of this breezy read with pop culture references that span from Lucas and Spielberg to Atari and Queen. He's not turning virtually every other line of exposition or exchange of dialogue into a cheap reference for any constructive, story-based reason. Cline is trying to demonstrate his nerd cred. It sucks. Characters tell each other repeatedly to ""use the Force"", then spends entire paragraphs describing scenes, not in any descriptive detail, but a series of endless references to other properties. It's a ""lucid dream like [...] Vanilla Sky"". It's a ""convincing computer simulation like in The Matrix"". It's ""an elaborate fantasy"" like ""an old Twilight Zone episode"". It goes on like this, page after page after page. Cline claims he does this in an attempt to draw the reader closer to the material, that is, if you already have a relationship to the cited material. Instead, it only comes across as lazy, s***ty writing. As it accumulates, it just becomes more and more cringe-worthy, like how all the video in the world is ""high-definition"". He mentions ""high-definition video"" at least four times for no reason than he can type those words into his book.

> Like ""Ready Player One"", our protagonist is, yet again, a teenage nerd lacking adult supervision who plays video games while immersed in a virtual reality headset, his hands wrapped around plastic game controllers. His friends are cardboard-thin props that only exist to dole out even more awful references to nerd culture. As it turns out, all of this nerdiness pays off for Zack as it turns out the video games he's spent playing were just a training program against a vast alien threat. Soon he's abducted into the clandestine Earth Defense Alliance and knuckled together with another batch of Cline-surrogates who all make and understand each other's 80s science-fiction references unironically and frequently.

> Cline only seems able to write one kind of character - himself, in a variety of slightly varied roles. Cline is himself as Zack Lightman and his long-dead father, Xavier Lightman. The former spends his entire life huddled in the shadow of the latter's immense leftover collection of 80s artifacts, going so far as to wear a denim jacket loaded with Atari-era game patches, something Cline no doubt probably owns. Cline is also Zack's boss, a rich former tech exec who runs a video game shop/nerd depot in a decript strip mall for giggles and offers him all the latest nerdery free, because this is all vapid fantasy. (Also: this nerd den shares a lot with a Thai restaurant they refer to as ""Thai Fighter"", via Star Wars, because god dammit Cline.) Oh, and Cline is also Zack's love interest, a fiercely independent feminist, uber-hacker and deus ex machina who nerds out on and loves Zack - I mean, Cline - from their first meeting, because duh.

> Even if this book is a Hail Mary for the Comic Con crowd, I'm not quite sure who would enjoy it. You have be at least thirty to understand most of what Cline is writing about, but despite the occasional F-bomb, the prose is ready for ten year olds. It's light reading that should've taken an afternoon to finish, but instead took me a week to slog through. Cline's cheap and ham-handed treatment of his influences make Kevin Smith's nerdery look like high art. At no point does Cline give Armada any room to breathe or explore what his Enders Game-meets-The Last Starfighter narrative could really do. Despite the fact that it's been four entire years since his debut, this book is shorter and substantially less imaginative. When Armada's characters aren't circle-jerking to Cline's most cherished memories, they're rushed through action scenes. Any dramatic tension Armada builds is quickly brushed away by a few lines of dialogue and everything's back to its turgid, vanilla state once more. The book barely takes flight half-way through when it crashes into a tacked-on and baffling conclusion that the author no doubt concocted on the flight over to deliver the manuscript.

> I hate this book. Cline even acknowledges how cool it is that Universal paid him a pretty penny for the film rights to this book, a fact made more frustrating that Armada would make an incredibly lazy movie.

3cz68t_9,3cz68t,"Finished it last night. First time I've ever felt compelled to write a review on goodreads. Below is what I wrote. Oh, and thar be spoilers:

I loved Ready Player One. LOVED it. I also ""read"" it via audio book. I don't know if Wil Wheaton's amazing read of RPO masked a lot of what I didn't like about Armada, or Ernest Cline's writing style changed/degraded in 4 years, but this book just didn't sit right with me.


Cline had a lot to live up to in his sophomore effort. I tried not to hype myself too much, but after telling practically everyone to drop what they were doing to read RPO, who am I kidding? I was frothing at the mouth to read Armada. What I wasn't expecting was essentially a reskin of RPO. The themes, beats, character archetypes were all there. I could almost predict when something would happen in correlation between the two books. I didn't go in expecting RPO Part 2. But I really felt like I was reading RPO v2.


Second, If I had a dollar for every instance of ""begin/began,"" ""seem/seems/seemed,"" and ""suddenly,"" I would have walked away from reading Armada with a nice chunk of change. Cline used these words so much it became jarring for me. I don't like sounding too cliched, but the frequency with which these words were used stuck out like so many sore thumbs. I ended up stopping at practically every instance to see if these words were necessary, and I'd say almost 100% of the time, they could have been completely omitted. But the book would have been shortened by about a third, give or take, so maybe it was kept in for padding?


Things moved too quickly. The relationship between Zack and Lex was forced. The end wrapped WAY too nicely. Sure, there's a little open endedness to leave room for a sequel, but the rate which Zack decided the fate of humanity, or that the EDA decided to wait so close to the Europan attack, made the ride through Armada just a bit too fast for my enjoyment.


That's not to say I didn't like certain parts of the book. As a gamer, I know I've gone on grand virtual adventures, and have some little part of my brain late on go ""hey, wouldn't it be awesome to go on an epic adventure like in a game?"" I can totally relate to that. When the action got going, it REALLY got going, and I could even overlook some of those unnecessary ""begans"" and ""seems."" I've seen a lot of people complaining about just how jam packed Armada is with pop culture referenced. While I agree there are a LOT, I went in expecting it after reading RPO. It made sense in that book, and the way in which it was used in this book made sense as well. Sure, there were a few times I thought ""that reference wasn't necessary,"" but otherwise, I didn't mind the nods too much.


It'll be interesting to see what Cline does next. He's 2 for 2 with video game-centric novels. I'm wondering if he'll return to this or RPO for a sequel, or he'll move onto a brand-new project. I hope whoever edits his next work knows when to chop some words. Whatever comes next, I'll be interested, and after my experience with Armada, I'm not sure I'll be nearly as eager, but maybe that's a good thing.",aricberg,2015-07-27T23:23:34Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,9

3cz68t_19,3cz68t,"I just finished and feel the need to talk a little about it.

First things first.  This is not Ready Player One.  If you go in expecting another RPO, you'll be a bit disappointed.

It has Cline's wacky imagination, a really fun way of linking geek culture and actual history into the story, and of course lots of pop culture references....which was part of the problem.

In RPO, pop culture became a way of life. It was plum neccessary to survive in the Oasis.  In Armada, it feels a little forced.  Its not terrible, it just didn't feel as well integrated.

Some of the plot points, and especially the end, felt rushed and not especially well explained.

But it was fun.  While my points above sound negative, I will admit it was a fun book and worth a read.  And I think thats key here.  Don't go into this book expecting a masterpiece like RPO.  Just read it for fun and entertainment and I think you'll enjoy yourself.

P.S. The copy I read was an advanced reading copy, so there may have been some changes that fix some of the minor issues.

873pu0_1,873pu0,"I don't see the big deal about this book. The world is cool, one of the coolest, but only because it's every bit of nerd pop culture in history all mixed together. Crediting Ernest Cline for what's actually fascinating about the world he presents is like crediting a museum curator for the beauty of the paintings in their gallery. Assembling and presenting everything took a lot of encyclopedic knowledge, dedication, and passion, but in the end the curator is simply a presenter. Almost everything that's cool about the world of Ready Player One was taken from something else. Not taken and repurposed a la Tarantino, simply cut and pasted into his world. Cline's only original contribution, the plot, is INCREDIBLY basic and predictable. It takes absolutely no risks, following such an obvious formula that the only time it subverts any expectations is when you let yourself think the story can't possibly be going where it seems, there's no way the writing could be THIS lazy and predictable. It's unclear what the book wants to be, it's written like young adult fiction but makes references written exclusively for people who were children in the 80s. It's like Wil Wheaton and 50 Shades of Grey had baby who's still living in their basement at 35.
Don't get me wrong, the idea of a Firefly-class transport with an X-Wing in the cargo bay is intoxicating, but after you shovel through the almost impossibly thick coating of pop-culture references (and it is THICK; one chapter is literally just the character living through the first ten minutes of WarGames as Matthew Broderick's character, at one point he plays Joust with Acererak the Arch-Lich from Tomb of Horrors, it's unrelenting) and wipe the nerdstalgia out of your eyes you realize all there is underneath is a small, shallow pile of worn-out tropes and tired cliches with no substance whatsoever.

873pu0_2,873pu0,"Well I hope this is the right place to post this. I wanted to post my thoughts on the novel, and the mod bot directed me here. Sorry about the entire intro-talking.

So I know the movie Ready Player One, based off the novel by Ernest Cline, is about to hit theaters. And that, from hearing all the hype and hearing a cover story on Sunday Morning, makes me very, very concerned.

This is going to get long, so if you want to read more, go ahead. If you like the series, that’s fine for me, but I feel that I should put my word out there, especially as a female in gaming.

I am a team manager for a college Overwatch team and have helped with establishing and supporting PACG. 
I have logged hours upon hours within video games, learning strategies, pushing rank (and maintaining a steady Plat-Diamond-Masters level in Overwatch), or simply having fun. I have played several MOBAS (League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Dota, Smite), MMOS (Warframe, Warcraft, Eve Online, FF14), and various single player games (Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, etc). 
My avatar is Genji. I was once known as Beanji until I re-branded for portfolio reasons. The majority of my art is artwork of Overwatch and of Warframe.
I once moderated and administrated for one of the biggest Minecraft servers in the world (and had to moderate said server when youtuber Ssundee entered the server at 2AM in the morning). 
I got my first ever video game (Pokemon) when I was barely five years old, and still play that series since.
The list can go on and on, but I think I can claim that video games are a big part of my life. I, too, have an NES and have played on an Atari (I do not, however, own one. I am not an 80′s kid, a bit too young for that).

Even if I am more open about my gender or not, my speech patterns within the gaming community (I have a tendency to type in full sentences because 110 WPM + mechanical keyboard yeah!) tend to have others pinpoint me or gender me as female (especially in League). I am not ashamed of my gender, I am actually proud to be a girl. But it really isn’t a big deal for me.

It shouldn’t be a big deal to others. But it usually is.

More than once, more than a handful of times, perhaps more than even 50 or so times, I have been harassed for pictures of my body, particularly of my breasts. I have been belittled (”you play like a girl!” or “you suck because you’re a girl” like my gender has anything to do with it) even if my performance within games matches or outmatches the rest of my team. I am not the best at video games, and my visual impairments do hurt me in fpses, as my reaction speed is terrible sometimes. And within my time in the video gaming community, I have seen people try to literally buy me or other females using in-game currency, items, or some other equivalent, all after learning of my gender. (50 plat for a girlfriend, anyone?)
While it can be hilarious, I also am very concerned, as it treats females like a commodity to be bought and sold. And I think we all know that’s a problem that’s is and has been happening in the world for centuries.

It is not to say that the video gaming community is completely sexist, despite being mainly male and sometimes very salty. It is not to say only men are at fault (sometimes the girls are meaner) or that females are the victims. I have met some of my best friends, boys, girls, that lovely rainbow in-between, including my girlfriend, through our love of video games. And I still play a ridiculous amount of video games.

However, Ready Player One maintains and almost celebrates that sort of problematic and sexist culture within video gaming society, as well as not really addressing other problems. I could go on, but today I want to address the still subtly sexist overtones of Ready Player One and how it almost celebrates that.

Ready Player One is not total trash; it does address body image issues, although in a stilted manner. It is considered a lighthearted read and the nerdy references, even if they are poorly written sometimes and shoved down your gullet at times, are nostalgic and entertaining at other times. As someone claimed it, it’s like “literary junk food”, entertaining and “tasty”, but only to be consumed in small doses. If you gloss over the fact it has little character development or barely any meaningful plot and the social issues, it can be a fun story.

But for the Huffington Post to claim that it has “fascinating social commentary” is to do a disservice to many in the technology and gaming culture.

Ready Player One reads like a self-insert fanfic for Ernest Cline, the author. The main character, Wade Watts/Parzival, has nothing in the real world, is the best at the game, and wins everything in the end and makes all the right choices, and he gets the girl he harassed.

When he first meets Art3mis, a high-level supposedly-female gamer and basically this story’s “trophy”, he flat out says “I’ve had a crush on you since before we even met. From reading your blog and watching your POV. I’ve been cyber-stalking you for years.”

Cyber-stalking. That’s an actual problem for some people, and that isn’t cute.

This has probably been stated before, but Wade spends a LOT of time talking about how beautiful and pretty (yet different) Art3mis is. Yes, she isn’t skinny like a supermodel, and that’s what makes her cool is the fact she “looks different” but that is STILL objectification. Wade tries to win her favor by flooding her “pad” with a ton of gifts, messaging her insistently, and just…being creepy and annoying. And Art3mis actually goes for it in the end, as if she’s okay being objectified, even when she, beforehand, told Wade to basically stop bothering her over messages. Art3mis becomes silent in the end. Wade basically buys her and it WORKS.

That’s a problem. And one that is glorified.

One that actually happens a lot. Sometimes in MOBAs, people get salty. I, too, get a bit angry when a game is going poorly sometimes. But when the insults fly, I am usually the first to go silent, because I’m tired of seeing sexist insults on my screen, of being accused “are you a girl? That’s why you suck”. I do not know if other female players do this as well other than my friends, but I find that the girls go silent first.

Then there’s Aech, who hides her gender and race because she is scared of being harassed. Wade is confused and angry at first, then suddenly magically overcomes that anger of being supposedly “lied to” in like seconds because it’s the right thing to do. And then it’s never addressed again. In fact, his representation of transfemale, is…terrifying, as seen here.

Art3mis: How well do you know Aech?
Parzival: He’s been my best friend for five years. Now spill it. Are you a woman? And by that I mean are you a human female that has never had a sex-change operation.
Art3mis: That’s pretty specific.
Parzival: Answer the question, Claire.
Art3mis: I am, and always have been, a human female. Have you met Aech IRL?

Yeah, that’s really specific. Does that mean everyone outside of that definition is not a woman? Because that’s pretty damn transphobic otherwise. Perhaps that’s not what Ernest means to write or claim, the passage really leans towards that suggestion.
And the fact that Parzival seems to be almost…threatening Art3mis to answer the question, that’s also concerning.

It also makes me wonder. Has Wade never been on the internet? There are a lot of trolls and people who are real nasty and people may hide behind masks, fake identities for various reasons. Aech has the potential for a lot of development, but she instead becomes a sort of throwaway character.

A lot of games are very problematic in terms of gender and the like, I admit. Overwatch has its issues, WoW’s outfits are sometimes geared toward the Male Gaze. GTAV is a thing sometimes. But what concerns me is this.

This book, I feel, uses a lot of “fluff” to hide the fact that there are some really serious issues. People claim that “it’s just for literary fun”. Yes, and so is GTAV. The gaming culture has issues, but at least certain companies like Riot and Blizzard try to take steps to acknowledge the harassment, even if it’s slow. There is no easy solution to it, but they don’t try to “cover it up” as vlrstlu as this book does.
But Ernest Cline especially tries to claim that his book is friendly and not sexist, when it clearly is. He uses the fluff to hide the problems and claim, and very transparent and flimsy passages to try and claim that “everything is okay”.

There is also his well known poem, Nerd Porn Auteur. It’s not SFW, so I’ll leave it at that, but it’s concerning as well.

I will say this.
If you’re sexist and transphobic, if you hold unpopular opinions, fine. You have the right to your thoughts and opinions. We have the right to agree or disagree. But don’t try to delude people that you aren’t.
And even if something’s funny and fluffy, it doesn’t excuse the problems, because actions speak louder than words, and the media is a really big action. If we want to make a statement we are going in a perhaps different direction, perhaps this book and movie is not the way to do it.

I am not trying to be hipster about it - I loved the book and I was really interested in seeing the movie.

May be it was the overly positive prior reviews, may be not. I read the book and enjoyed it, but I find the best parts of the book missing from the movie. I am surprised the author is actually part of the script team.

The book was about game/80s nostalgia, the movie was about creepy obsession with the personality/life of the OASIS developer. The kids were very 2D, the plot - overly thin - drones dropping bombs - everyone can see them in plain sight - how stupid is this?

There was a talk about ""hard life"", but there is hardly any seen in the movie.

OK, the video games part was cool, but that's not what the book was about, IMHO.

No explaination is given as to its purpose although I had guessed it was a continue or extra life. Later in the book the planet he's on blows up and everyone dies including him. His screen goes dark and instead of reading ""game over"" the screen says congratulations you have an extra life. This really bugged me. Given the lengths the book goes into retro video game culture and the fact that it was a quarter (not a green mushroom) I really feel like it would have been more satisfying and on theme to have the screen flash ""continue?""

I figured that even if I didn't particularly enjoy a book, at least I might gain a new perspective, knowledge, or at the very least be able to discuss it with others that have also read it. This book was so awful that now if I'm not enjoying a book 100 pages in, I put it down and move on to something else. 

The entire thing read like a neck beard's wet dream. After embarrassing a ""poseur"" with his video game knowledge, the crowd in the virtual basement literally ""burst into applause"" while the antagonist ""lowered his head in shame"". The dialogue had me wondering if the author had ever actually had a conversation in real life.

3j4b92_7,3j4b92,"I love reading. I am an avid video game player and loved everything 80s having lived through it as a kid. I was told I would love Ready Player One. I eagerly read it and unfortunately found myself dismayed and extremely frustrated. I hate saying ""offended"" because people nowadays are so easily offended by stuff, but man....I was offended and just really frustrated, and here is my question:

**Why did you feel the need to use such annoying cliche and offensive racial stereotypes?** 

**Why is the 80s world of pop culture so devoid of anyone but white men?** 

No Run DMC? No Michael Jackson, King of Pop? No Eddie Murphy? Bill Cosby? (pre-knowledge of rapist Cosby of course) Mr T? The Last Dragon? Madonna? Roberta Williams of Sierra Entertainment? Nothing at all.  I mean, clearly Og and Halliday are clearly supposed to be like Roberta and Ken Williams, yet you instead make them both men and relegate the woman to nothing more than a bygone love triangle plot point (and dead, at that!)

I first raised my eyebrows at:
> 
> ""What if I were a 300 lb. gal named Charlene, who lives in her mom’s basement in suburban Detroit? Would you still have a crush on me then?"" 

I stopped and thought, Detroit? Charlene? He couldn't possibly be making the slick implication of the cliche fat black in DETROIT of all places, right? I shrugged it off and continued. 

Then Aech turns out to be a fat black gay unattractive woman with short hair raised by a single mother with no father. And her mother did not accept her. The ONLY black person in the book and this is what you give us.

Daito and Shoto both fashion themselves as the cliche, stoic, honor bound samuaris who bow constantly and say ""arigato"". Was this supposed to be funny? Oh hey, lets create some asians and because they are Asian in real life they are going to be into martial arts stuff and discuss honor all the time like we haven't seen this stereotype before. And they are obviously playing it straight, as they are both actually Japanese. This isn't Robert Downey Jr in Tropic Thunder providing commentary. Diato and Shoto are presented as is, like the real Aech, and that is extremely troublesome. 

I found myself cringing while reading, not enjoying. Why are minorities STILL treated as walking stereotypes? Fat black woman? stoic martial arts asians? love triangle non existent woman?

So...was all of that necessary?  I don't really expect a reply and I also expect to be downvoted, but hopefully this gets your attention. And yes, Aech turned out to be a woman, but it had no bearing on the story. And I still don't really know who Artemis was as a character. Bad writing, maybe. But also much more.

I would love to hear a real response to this and not some cop out about ""this is this white guy's life and what he experienced"" nonsense that we constantly hear from Seinfeld, Friends, The OC, Mad Men creators on why their stories are so devoid of color and only use stereotypes to show minorities. I mean, its one thing to tell your story, its another to disparage others while doing it. So please don't play that card.

Why the cringe worthy racial stereotypes?",redroverdover,2015-08-31T21:58:32Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,7
3j4b92_8,3j4b92,"
I’m sorry if these come across as rude or overly direct… actually I’m not so here it goes:


First, is Armada a finished product you truly, whole heartedly, stand behind as a finished/professional piece of writing?


Second, if so, who exactly was the target audience, what do you think of the current state of literary publication as a whole?


If these seem disjoint, I apologize, but I don’t think they are. Full disclosure: I’m a writer myself and I hated Armada. I thought the writing was juvenile, the plot contrived, and the characters one-dimensional. No, I take that back, they had zero dimensions: you can’t just slap references and quotes onto a page and call it meaningful dialogue. No characters develop out of that. And that’s what brought about the first question. You’ve expressed a lot of interest in screen writing and bragged about Ready Player One’s movie adaptation. Did you ever treat Armada like a fully-fledged literary project or was it always something you treated as a stepping stone to a cinema infused paycheck?


And that brings me to that second question, because Armada pisses me off for reasons that go beyond it writing. I’ve been struggling to identify and clarify what it means to be a genre writer in today’s scene: what it means to be a John Green in YA or a King in horror, and the seemingly continuous cutting up of literature into subgenres that not only separate readers but push writers towards specializing for certain audiences/editors/literary presses. Do you see Armada contributing to that? Who was it even written for? Was the juvenile writing supposed to make it YA (but then what of all those 80s references)? Did you write with an audience of readers in your mind or – is it as I expect – that you wrote with only studio executives and movie producers in mind? Because that kind of thinking, that direct to sequel/movie/self-produced nonsense seems even more dangerous than the strict genre-fication of mainstream literature.


I just want some defense of this work, I guess. Sorry for the rant.

I was wondering, did you intend for the gunters getting obsessed with the 80s culture to sort of mirror in some of the readers who also didn't live through the 80s? Like me, I've been almost exclusively watching most of the movies and listening to the music you referenced and I've become a fan of a lot of it. I thought this was an interesting parallel.

I enjoyed reading Ready Player One with my wife, we actually just finished the audio book two days ago. We always felt like something was missing though.

My book club is discussing 'Ready Player One', tomorrow, by sheer coincidence, and I was hoping to contribute something.. a little less obvious to the discussion. 

Having played video games from the 90s onward, I've exposure to at least some of the references to 80s video game culture. What surprises me is how accessible the book is, even to those members of my book club without similar gaming backgrounds (we're mixed gender, mid/late twenties, for reference). 

What challenges did you face when writing for an audience that hasn't necessarily experienced many of these things?

What is something that you wished that you could have included in Ready Player One, that might have been lost on someone born a decade and a half later?",sojojo,2015-08-31T21:18:58Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,25

But I feel like the core of what makes something a book club versus some people reading a book around the same time is missing here, and it's not Cline's fault.

There needs to be some structure and some talking points that incite discussion. The questions on his AMAs were mostly about a different book, a movie being made of said book, or brown nosing non-questions.

Putting the AMAs aside, I didn't see any participants trying to start thoughtful discussions about the book. There was lots of talk about how bad it was, but even these devolved into comments about Ready Player One.

It stinks that the first book was by an apathetic charlatan, but ultimately that shouldn't effect whether the people reading the book can have meaningful conversations about it.

Ready Player One is male Twilight. Teenage wish-fulfillment without much depth, character development, or real problem solving.

Don't get me wrong, I thought it was a bit charming in it's own way, even if the clunky writing and failure to delve into any of the interesting ideas it provoked was annoying, but at least it lacked the ""go date creepy abusive guys"" moral that Twilight has. 

Still, structurally, it's the same thing.

I read:
  - a lot of science fiction
  - a lot of YA

I am:
  - a pessimist
  - a 28 yo white male 
  - bad at love. (I didn't have a succesful relationship until 26, mostly because I was a selfish little shit.)

I love Ready Player One because it brought me back to reading. Since I read this very easy (popcorn) book in two days, I have read a lot of harder books including Neuromancer, (also a completely selfish wish fulfillment tripe fest, but with more porn treatment of women, also nichely lauded.) The Gate Thief, most of the dune series, Thomas Jefforson and the Tripoli Pirates, and others. Lets be honest though, if reddit wasn't mocking guilty pleasures, what would it be?

I'd agree with that, though I've never read twilight. The individual characters were poorly developed, but what stood out to me was the world concept as a whole. I thought the concept of the society that has embraced consumerism to the point that the central government has collapsed and was replaced by a massive corporation was interesting and pretty relevant to our current ongoing situation. 

The world certainly could have been fleshed out more, but I felt like at least the main character's actions and inner monologue, filled with all the random geek crap, was consistent with that world. It's a kid who spent literally his entire life obsessed with 1 guy and everything the guy liked. Since he had a list of all of Hallidays favorite games, as well as free access to play all those games, it didn't really seem like a stretch that he would have spent time playing those games as part of preparation for the contest that his entire life revolves around.

That's funny. That's exactly what happened to me, too. I wanted to read again but just couldn't. I admit it was only a year-and-half break from reading novels, but that was really long for me. My mind would just tense up if I tried picking up a book (although I could still listen to short story podcasts).

During the summer, my friends kept texting me if I had seen the *Ready Player One* movie yet, as they wanted to discuss it with me, so I broke down and finally opened up my Kindle copy of the book I had purchased way back in 2011. I wanted to read it before I watched the movie.

Like you, I read the book in a couple days, and it was the catalyst for me to get back into reading.

I mean, sure, I kept thinking why is the writing so mediocre as I read the book, but I just loved the 80s nostalgia.  The characterization was so generic and shallow, almost laughably bad, but the over-saturation of 80s geek culture kept me reading.

Sometimes an easy-to-read popcorn book is what you need.  I was reading Dostoevsky, Flaubert and others before my break, so maybe I just needed some mindless entertainment to jump start my brain.

It's funny that you mentioned *Neuromancer*, but right before my reading hiatus, I had reread that book. I actually liked it more the second time around than when I had read it as a kid, as I was able to spot things I hadn't before (the use of semiotics, the bizarre blend of Raymond Chandler noir and William S. Burroughs drug literature, etc), but maybe it did fry my brain a little.",UltraFlyingTurtle,2018-09-30T07:55:45Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,6

2rmher_2,2rmher,"> Why aren't all books like that?

Honestly?  *Ready Player One* is very plot driven, without much depth.  That's not necessarily a criticism; it's a very fun book and I similarly read it all in one sitting. It keeps you hooked, and that's not a trivial skill; a number of successful professional authors couldn't manage it to save their lives.  *RPO* has a sufficiently straightforward and fast moving plot that any flaws are swept totally under the rug while you're reading it.  In contrast, *Midnight's Children* by Salman Rushdie is dense and labyrinthine; it's only twice as long as *RPO*, but took me a full month to read because it demanded I read with care and thought.

So not all books are like that because not everybody wants that all of the time.  I'm glad you found something you loved so much though :)",satanspanties,2015-01-07T13:11:30Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,2
2rmher_3,2rmher,"One of the reasons 'Ready Player One' reads so quickly and is so plot-driven is because it was originally conceived by its author, Ernest Cline, as a screenplay to be made by Warner Bros.

This is one of my favorite books and I've convinced several of my friends and relatives to read it and they all loved it as well.

2rmher_4,2rmher,"I lived through the entirety of the 1980s at about the same age as the author, and I found Ready Player One to be sort of dumb. The most succinct thing I've read in criticism of the book was where someone compared it to that old Chris Farley sketch on SNL where he interviews famous people and asks them go-nowhere questions like ""hey remember when you made Ghostbusters?"" ""Yeah."" ""That was awesome."" Throughout the entirety of Ready Player One, Ernest Cline is Chris Farley and his guest is the 1980s.

If you're interested in reading a piece of 1980s nostalgia that has a bit more depth and is more evocative, I'd suggest Kevin Brockmeier's ""A Few Seconds of Radiant Filmstrip."" It mines the same territory with much better results.

I'd say it's only redeeming quality is that it's made of paper , and can therefore serve as emergency bogroll, but unfortunately they chose a fairly non absorbent paper- so it lacks even that merit.  If you remove all the 80's references and callbacks, the book is 3 pages long, and most of that is pronouns.  CAlling RPO badly written is offensive to bad writers everywhere.   If you managed to enjoy Ernest Clines masturbatory journey through nostalgiaville, with it's half dimensional characters, almost functional narrative, and self obliterating motivations, I can only imagine how thoroughly blown away you will be by actual science fiction.

Not only is is too dependent on references, is spends so much time clumsily explaining the references that it reads like it's interwoven with wikipedia articles. The plot is a generic YA dystopia with a virtual reality twist, and the VR is uninteresting because it shows no creativity or originality at all -- it's just a method used to cram in all the pointless 80's references/wikipedia articles. Like someone else already mentioned, so many obstacles the protagonist encounters are handled in the laziest, tension-destroying way (Looks like Wade has to play Joust to get this key. Luckily, it just so happens that he played Joust for 40,000 hours last summer -- which hasn't been mentioned until this moment -- so he's able to beat it easily. Btw, what's a Mary Sue?).

My only explanation for why people liked it is that fans of it must be people who aren't very well-read. They're the type of people that haven't picked up a book since the Sparksnotes they read to get through high school, but ended up buying RPO at an airport because they heard it made references to their favorite 80's movies and video games.",soupspoontang,2019-08-14T18:30:46Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,9

omrybm_1,omrybm,"For context: I adore Ready Player One. The book is fantastic and the movie took it up a notch for me, it never fails to fill me with childlike awe, makes me remember what it felt like to discover videogames for the first time, realizing the huge possibilities of the medium. Exploring, having fun, disconnecting from the real world and embarking in epic adventures. I love it.

Needless to say, I was EXTREMELY excited to read Ready Player Two... and I honestly don't know what in the sweet universe happened here. I kinda liked the beginning and I kinda liked the ending. That's it. Everything else is just so, *so weird*. In the first book, I felt that most references were either important to the story or just fun and added something of value to the world. Here, not only did many of them feel extremely forced, **They. Are. Relentless.** 

>!The John Hughes planet was painful to read, the references to places, characters and songs rained down like machine gun fire. They just didn't stop. I will admit I barely know John Hughes' work, so that may have also influenced it. Who I also don't know (or really care about, to be honest) is Prince. I wish the back cover of the book had a warning that said ""LOL I HOPE YOU'RE A MASSIVE FAN OF PRINCE"" at least I would have known what I was getting into. My god, it just kept going f o r e v e r. !<

I also want to point out how the characters always seem to know exactly where to go and what to do. No research, no thinking about the problem, they just go ""yep, I know where that is!"" It made the whole thing feel very rushed. By the end I was just happy that it was over. And that's not good.

I feel this book only exists because the first one was successful and because the movie was directed by Spielberg. I honestly didn't feel any passion from the writer this time around, or effort to expand the universe in new ways.

>!This is Sword Art Online with pop culture references. Nothing more, nothing less. And I love Sword Art Online, not even the similarity was enough to keep me interested.!<",MoonDust1969,2021-07-21T02:33:57Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,1

6brc6i_2,6brc6i,"Ready Player One is the biggest heap of shit that I've ever loved. I burned through the whole thing in a day. I really liked the concept and I agree about the visualisation of the scenes. In fact, I'd say it was probably the first book I've read for which I had a crystal clear mental image of every scene. The dialogue was really cringy a lot of the time, the romantic bits especially, but that didn't annoy me *too* much. My least favourite part by far was that the protagonist was way too OP. He essentially didn't put a foot wrong through the whole thing. I could just about accept him beating [Spoiler](#s ""Joust"") on his first try because he'd played it a lot before, but a lot of the other scenes were just ridiculous. For example, the perfect [Spoiler](#s ""Pac-Man"") game he just cracked out in one sitting when he said it was one of his weaker games. Also, the whole [BIG SPOILER](#s ""killing off of the top gunters"") seemed completely unrealistic. Why on Earth would they risk doing that when they could just [BIG SPOILER](#s ""gang up on them and kill them in-game with their hundreds of avatars?""). Although I was born after ~~the book is set~~ the 80s, I didn't mind the large number of references. I thought it was pretty cool because it taught me some cool little facts about some early games.

Overall, good book with a gripping story to burn through quickly, but it really isn't well written at all and I'm not the kind of person who usually picks up on things like that.

No one pretended that it was anything more than a fun nerdy nostalgic romp, but it was rather good at what it was doing. However, at some point a book so targeted to a gamer nerd audience became politically incorrect, because of cultural war politics that have nothing to do with the contents of the book itself.

Something somewhat similar happens with Harry Potter, because of the recent controversy regarding the author's opinions on feminism and transexuality.

The *RP1* honeymoon ended in the first chapter of *Armada*. After several attempts, a certain something is clearly missing, and there's always another book I can pick up instead of trying to grind through *Armada*.

As a Star Wars sucker who was okay with episode VII basically recycling IV's plot elements, I have a feeling that if he keeps a similar formula of *RP1* for *Ready Player Two*, I'll be okay with that - but I'll thumb through the first chapter before it ends up in the basket.

I love video games, and due to not having that much money, i have grown a taste for indie, retro and just low end games, hell, the last games i bought are Wild Guns Reloaded and Crypt Of The Necrodancer:Amplified, so reading about older games was pretty cool, even if there are quite a few i have never played, like Zork and Joust.

It also helps that i knew the mechas, not that much into 70's and 80's anime, but a few of the mechas appear in the Super Robot Wars series, which is pretty much Fire Emblem without permadeath and dating and more giant robots destroying things with many robots from old and new anime being in the same game, so seeing Raideen being mentioned just made me think ""Cool, the robot from SRW MX and Alpha is here...and without his annoying theme from the Alpha series!"", too bad that Ready Player One didn't much with their attacks though, would have been cool to see Raideen's God Voice attack being used.

Oh, and i am a huge nerd, and a Kaiju fan, and i like the Ultraman Franchise, so seeing the original Ultraman make an appearance along others like Mechagodzilla is really freaking cool.

But that's the thing, the book is full of references and cool imagery that is really fun to remember and imagine but there's just not that much depth to the whole story, the setting itself is far more memorable than the story and characters.",fandivision,2017-07-15T09:55:00Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,7

The Easter egg is a puzzle hidden in the game by its creator, and is a puzzle centred around 80s culture. This was by far the highlight of the novel. The references are spot on, they aren’t general enough to be considered trivial, and they’re not obscure enough they only a handful of readers would understand them. They feel very authentic and real, and is the selling point of the book. There is a chapter that revolves around Blade Runner that is extremely polished. 

The second half of the book let’s it down. The storyline isn’t as strong, the main character Wade makes odd decisions that aren’t fully fleshed out and performs actions that don’t seem in tone. Events move at alternating speeds, and the final battle feels not only rushed, but also out of tone with the book. It was unnecessary. 

The book really gerrymanders to many “neckbeards” and “nice guys” (Urban Dictionary) that the book appears to be written for. It is full of extremely cringe inducing one liners. The romantic storyline is poorly written, and if anything a little bit sexist. Of course he meets the girl whose blog he was stalking (so basically one of the aforementioned guys meeting one of their favourite twitch streamers). Of course she is beautiful in the real world, but he doesn’t care, he loves her for who she is, before he even met her. Of course he assumed they were in a relationship when they had never even met. Of course she was sorry for how poorly she treated him and kissed him. Give me a break. 

The first chapter randomly has footnotes which are absent from the rest of the book. Which feel out of place in retrospect. 

Even with my criticism. I still enjoyed it, and have high hopes for the film.",oldm8Foxhound,2018-03-20T10:13:47Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,1

TLDR, I think that Ready Player One is basically Ernest Cline writing absolutely terrible fanfiction of William Gibson's work, specifically Neuromancer.

Ready Player One is good bubble gum for your brain to chew on but it won’t fulfill you like really good books will. Cline didn’t do anything creative, sophisticated, or even all that clever with the plot, writing, characters, or world building. In a lot of ways he just took a lot of already popular stuff, added some tired-but-reliable tropes, and wrote a very, very lazy hero’s journey. For those reasons, it’s pretty bad.

Scifi in general is an underappreciated genre of fiction. It's easy to bash it because of its quirks. It's sort of a right of passage though. But I digress. Most people hate how watered down (and numerous) the references are. However since I wasn't able to actually experience the 80s I appreciated being spoon fed (force fed?) the references. Others hated it because it seemed to reinforce toxic gamer/fanboy culture. Which I never understood that argument. It didn't reinforce it. It was a reflection of it, albeit a poor one at that.

lw8bkv_1,lw8bkv,"So, I think the first thing to say is that if you love it, that’s good enough. You should not in any way feel bad for loving it because I hated it or even feel like you have to reconsider your feelings about it. At the deep heart of things, the book is essentially about entertainment and so that should be the primary judge of it. Did it entertain you? So long as the answer is yes, that’s what matters. 

Having got that out of the way, I’ll speak a *little* to why I hated it, and parts I found offensive. 

Ready Player One is a deeply metatextual book. Meaning that much of its own text relies upon other texts in order for it to make sense. A great surface example would be the task where the solution is to speak the lines of Monty Python and the Holy Grail verbatim in order to pass the test. Ready Player One relies on the knowledge of Monty Python and the Holy Grail AND the cultural response to Monty Python and the Holy Grail by early internet programmers in order for the full meaning of the moment to come through. You can get some of the meaning from just reading Ready Player One but the majority of the meaning is outside the text. 

To a certain extent this is necessarily true of all stories. It’s not a question of IF a story has metatextual elements but instead it’s a question of HOW MUCH a story relies on metatextual information. Ready Player One requires more metatextual information than usual for a full understanding of what is going on. If you’ve never seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail, you are necessarily missing part of the story. 

Since my memory is essentially datable - someone mentions the date in my earliest memory - to June 1st 1982, I lived through a lot of Ready Player One’s references. I recognize them as my own childhood. For some like me that’s a wonderful trip of nostalgia. For me, it’s a list of references to things I liked better. I do quote Monty Python and the Holy Grail, fairly regularly, because I find it very quotable. So I get the moment that’s trying to be evoked. But for me it’s telling me about that moment instead of doing the job itself. Instead of getting me engaged in the activity and calling along its stating that the activity is happening and relying on me and my memory to provide the actual experience. 

That encapsulates my fundamental issue with the book. To me it feels like a list of prompts for me to fill in better experiences with. That doesn’t necessarily mean that’s what the book literally is. Plenty of people my age and older experience it as gleeful nostalgia. And it’s really just a matter of how enjoyable that metatextual experience is for an individual. 

Unfortunately, for people like myself who experience it as a loose framework of metatextual calls, like a page full of links to outside sources that we have to click to get the full experience, it primes us to see links where the author probably really didn’t intend for us to see them but which may still be there. 

A prime example of that is the sexism in the trope of the pretty girl who thinks she’s ugly because of a minor imperfection that any reasonable person would see past. This idea makes a lot of unfortunate metatextual calls. 

Art3mis has a minor skin blemish on her face. It’s clearly depicted as minor. But she has a lot of hang ups about it. ***IF*** Art3mis was a point of view character or even a character with more space to move in the psychology of that could be dug into and she could have a small character arc around that, moving out of her hang up. But because we see her only through the point of view of Wade, it’s a metatextual call, it’s relying on other things to fill in the gaps. Which brings up the trope. The trope has the sexist problems that physical imperfection is bad, no matter what it is, and that it carries with it inherent devaluation. 

The issue is in part the normative push. We’re looking at something that would just pass in polite society after maybe a stare or two. AND it’s being presented as a serious issue that will hold someone back socially. Which means it is supporting a normative range of appearance that’s extremely small. It’s setting up by implication (the metatext) that there is a specific narrow set of ways someone has to look for them to be tolerable.

Imagine for a second how that scenario would play out if she had a severe physical deformity. The sort of look that most of our polite society would shun rather than ignore. And don’t change anything else. That gives the entire situation a radically different meaning because it challenges rather than supports the norm. If it can be reasonably extrapolated that most people would find her hideous but Wade doesn’t, it’s calling into question why people find her socially unacceptable. He can. Why not you? Define a hideous person as beautiful and it begs the question of what beauty really means. 

Just do that to someone who is clearly defined as pretty but for one little thing and it’s the opposite of a challenge, it’s saying our cultural reactions are normal and it’s simply that men are entitled to judge, even when the judgement is largely superfluous. 

And that flip side continues. Because it’s put as Wade recognizing her beauty, even though she’s already good looking, it’s taking away any sort of objectivity to her looks. Her beauty is defined in how he sees her, how she sees herself is just something to be overcome. This is touching on a huge topic called the Male Gaze. Summarized to the point that it’s almost wrong: the Male Gaze is the cultural right of Men to define and appreciate Women’s bodies and sexuality without reference to the Women themselves. Within that you might see reference to a Butter Face, meaning But Her Face, or she’s got a hot body BUT her face! And Art3mis plays right into that. She’s pretty but that little mark on her face. 

Wade though, as the man, has the right to judge her beauty regardless of her feelings or shame or anything. He loves her, supposedly, so he gets to say she’s pretty because that’s how he feels about it. 

And because she’s not pretty except in his eyes she’s not all stuck up like other pretty girls. She is, in fact, not like other girls, with the implication that other girls are bad for being like girls and different from Art3mis. And That can be seen to continue in Aech. Aech essentially IS a boy for most of the text. So Wade ends up only liking women who aren’t like other girls, both for partnering and friendship. Which means most women aren’t welcome in the world he sees as valuable. Value is given to difference from femininity. 

The farther you go the bigger these sorts of things get. They’re huge topics. And they’re absolutely worth reading about. Because the biggest thing of all to see is that metatext is everywhere. It’s in every story. It’s in every advertisement. It’s in our conversations. It’s unavoidable. It simply is. Which means, unfortunately, that no statement is an isolated incident. If Ready Player One existed in a vacuum, these wouldn’t be issues. The problem is that Ready Player One is interconnected with thousands of other communications that add up to serious pushes on the way people think because it becomes the water we swim in. You want to learn about it all to see how people are building your world around you and to make sure that’s the world you want. 

Part of that is being aware of things in the stories you like. But it’s also important to keep the idea that you like it. Ready Player One is still saying something valuable to you. And that valuable message should not be discarded. The ultimate trick is being able to experience both at the same time. The good and the bad. They don’t actually cancel each other out. They co-exist. And if you can see them both, you can deal with them both, enjoy what you enjoy, and do your best to counter the messages you would rather not spread.",Empty_Manuscript,2021-03-02T19:28:08Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,1

81qisi_1,81qisi,"I also am reading Ready Player One because my buddy said it was good and the movie is coming out.

I just can't get into it. It fairly predictable and I dislike almost everything about the writers style. The lack of character descriptions made it feel like a twilight book written for guys. Where the main character is however you would imagine him, so you can interest yourself in his place. (note this isnt a bad thing, its just I find that vivid descriptions of characters is part of the fun of reading a story)

And I really disliked his constant use of references. If you take out half the references the book would be like 20% shorter. 

Not to mention all the characters felt pretty similar. The world really wasnt well developed, for a dystopian future set 20 years from now. If the countries were fighting over limited resources, you can bet they wouldnt have an entire generation of boys sitting in a virtual world(they'd be drafted to get those resources). 

Hopefully the movie is significantly better. Steven Spielberg is a great director and the source material isnt unworkably bad. The funny thing I can see happening is a lot of people will complain about the characters not looking like their book counterparts(without realizing that the book is very lax on character details).

I wish he would have described Wade.

7ezu5x_1,7ezu5x,"Other than what you mentioned, I also noticed a couple more similarities between SAO and the Ready Player One Series'. 

For starters, was it not coincidental how Halliday's Golden Egg was somewhat similar in form to Akihiko Kayaba's ""Aincrad"" or what Mr. Kayaba referred to as ""The Seed""; as a big golden egg?. 

Furthermore, the similarities between both series can also be signified by how closely both peoples in these games relatively behaved. Though to be fair, in terms of relativity, their only falling out was being out of context for how they ended up within their own respective world. In ""Ready Player One"" some people chose to deal life's problems by outliving them, by living life differently on a virtual platform, it was just another feature that society had pushed on them though to be fair many preferred the virtual world over reality. The same stigma could sorta be said for SAO, although the players were forced to live within ""Aincrad"", some made way in their prison and found ways to best themselves and lead lives in their own unique directions. On another note, coincidentally enough both of these creators of their online worlds also left their protagonists with the options to build-on or destroy these worlds. 

Additionally, how both Kayaba and Halliday left their respective series' were on very eery notes, both hinting or morbidly describing to the audience just what they had done to themselves or what rest of them laid real and existing in reality. An explanation I could imagine is that they both uploaded their ""consciousness"" to their own respective networks(e.g. Kayaba's mind now being on the internet POSSIBLY even in ""The Cardinal System"" and Halliday's mind continuing his existence in his creation ""The Oasis"").

Honestly, I guess what I'm trying to figure out is ""Who did it better?"" in terms of which series was more popular and well done with the whole ""Life is now a video-game"" dread but I suppose that doesn't really matter. What does matter is that they were both great stories with very entertaining plots, just for that they both get a thumbs up in my book. I'm looking forward to the sequel of ""Ready Player One"", which I suppose will be named ""Ready Player Two""?? lol, or Ready Player One Two (jkjk pls dont name it that)",KingBbTt87,2018-05-04T16:35:59Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,1

Ready Player One is a pandering 80's nostalgia trip with a trite plot, shallow characters, and feels more like an advertisement for 80's junk than it does a real book. Snow Crash is clever and original with a much greater spirit of 'fun.'

2tb9km_2,2tb9km,"That's a very interesting topic to talk about, namely when we say a book is ""good,"" do we simply mean to say it's fun or is there some other quality we're looking at?

Perhaps 5 years ago I would've agreed that fun and entertainment is the only criteria for judging a book's greatness, but I guess I've just gotten tired of reading many books like Ready Player One that are mildly entertaining, you put it down, and never care to read it again.

Of course I'm not saying that sci-fi HAS to try and teach some message or reflect a part of the real world to be good, but if it's mostly just a fantasy like RPO, it needs to be a very good fantasy, where the characters are compelling, the drama tense, the setting memorable. I guess the bottom-line for me is that if a book is pure fantasy, if I want to continue exploring the world when I'm done and/or hear more about the characters in it, it's a good book. RPO was a page-turner but never really left me with that feeling. Instead, I feel like I've thought more about things that could've been done better or were cliched rather than the story itself.",thewhiteafrican,2015-01-22T20:15:46Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,2

They are wildly different books, written for wildly different demographics (I'm not actually in the target audience for *either* book).

Ready Player one is definitely more accessible and I think it does a better job describing what being inside the game is like compared to Snow Crash. I also like how Parzival is totally average in the real world and it really takes him some work to become even slightly threatening in order to bring about his plans.

31idhp_3,31idhp,"Zork has a really shitty maze that is super discouraging to a new player, and things do move around in it to some degree! 

I would actually recommend not starting with Zork, as it has a higher learning curve and doesn't really help you out much - it's a challenging first game to try if you aren't already familiar with the genre. Wishbringer^The^Magick^Stone^of^Dreams (1985) is my favorite IF game to play with newbies, it has the sassy tone and humor that is usually associated with the game, a pretty detailed set of characters and landscape, and a rewarding plot, but is also a pretty quick playthrough (maybe 3-6 hours for a first time, with most people clocking in closer to 3-4 hours) and has a lot of great extra materials to help you along. It's generally classified as a beginner's game, and takes place in the same universe as Zork (with a small easter egg nod to the Zork game setting that you'd recognize from *Ready Player One*). 

I would also recommend not bothering to create your own map, which is just going to needlessly frustrate you unless you're specifically doing it to say you did/prove a point - instead either grab a map online or if you want to be really official, search up a scan of the original gamebook and map that came boxed with the giant floppy disk when players originally bought the game. The official maps were usually less detailed and more stylized (think the kinds of map drawings printed in the front pages of Lord of the Rings volumes rather than grid drawings with item lists), but it'll give you enough to go on to start off not entirely at a loss. 

For example, here are all the links/downloads I would recommend to someone wanting to spend an evening playing though Wishbringer:

* [Wishbringer game download from Abandonware](http://www.myabandonware.com/game/wishbringer-77)    
* an interpreter download - this is the interface that will run your game, and I'm not really partial to any specific one. [This page lists a couple for different OSes that will work with Wishbringer](http://inform7.com/download/)    
* [THE WISHBRINGER INVISICLUES](http://www.resonant.org/games/infocom/Infocom_Homepage/Invisiclues/Old/wishbringer.html) - think invisible ink/scratchaway hint booklet. It's no fun to play Infocom games without these; these older less sophisticated games are designed to be played with a bit of a hint system, because they just weren't quite at the point yet where the game universe itself can gently nudge the player in the direction of the appropriate goals/items the way modern games do. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InvisiClues) has a cool summary of what InvisiClues(TM) are and the format they came in with the original game packaging, if you want some of the history. 
* [Wishbringer game map](http://gallery.guetech.org/wishbringer_invisiclues/wishbringer_invisiclues.html) - this is the one that was included in the game box, but really I usually just google ""[game name] map"" and grab whatever is most complete, though usually you will be able to find the original promotional map if you're willing to spend time digging for it. 

Another thing to remember is that being less sophisticated than modern games, these old Infocomp games are possible to make unwinnable if you miss out on a certain item/character prompt. So save frequently and give your save files descriptive names, otherwise you'll wind up starting over more times than you want. What's fun and interesting the first 5 times through gets really exhausting and discouraging the 20th time around. :P I played Wishbringer with a couple friends last month and between the 3 of us (2 backseat drivers who had played it before, 1 new person handling the keyboard) we created 40ish save points and took about 3 hours to get through the game. Just don't play the game where you take a drink every time someone typos and gets sassed at by the game, it doesn't end well. ",,2015-04-05T23:10:10Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,3

eogwd5_1,eogwd5,"I'm looking at it as something that was a bit overlooked. Sure, someone could possibly grind to 99 in that amount of time seeing as everyone practically lives in the OASIS. But the thing is, the book wasn't aimed at being completely accurate. The novel wanted a nostalgic gaming atmosphere, which it succeeded in. 

Agreed on the point that leveling gets progressively harder the higher you go, and since everyone is mostly connected to the OASIS, the devs would've balanced the game out due to the increased playing time of the average person. 

One thing to note however is that in the Ready Player One universe, money plays a significant role in how well they progress. Wade didn't have a lot of money, so he was mostly chilling in Ludus. The moment he got the first key, he leveled up significantly and got a lot of in-game money. They also get more money and experience from the other keys and gates. The more money they have, the better equipment they have, both in the real world and in the game world. That would aid in completing quests, winning in wars, and exploring the in-game universe, hence getting more experience points. 

Now, considering that right after getting the keys and completing 2 gates both Art3mis and Aech go on a rampage and grind it out for the sole purpose of exp points and nothing else, it could be possible to gain the required experience points to get to 99. Just think of how quickly you can grind to level 99 in Ragnarok. Or in other online games wherein players basically had to force their characters to level down via NPC-deaths, just so they could stay in a specific level range. 

Even with this reason, of course, I still think it's highly unlikely that they get to 99 that quickly. The devs would've balanced the game out since it would be too easy to get to 99 if that were the case. The Lost Generation basically lives in the OASIS, so that would mean that experience points would be balanced to a trickle should people start grinding for the sole purpose of leveling up. 

It's a light read, and an enjoyable one for what it is. At least the author got the retro games right.",espressofredo,2020-01-14T09:15:28Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,1
eogwd5_2,eogwd5,"I always thought he used the pay to play option to quick grind. 


One of the many critics the book gets is that the game system is practically none existent, while other books go to extremes setting up a game system and world, ready player one focuses more on 80s nostalgia and says ""well, the OASIS is open world, you do what you want!"" which even in an open world / sandbox game is not how things work.",Kidlike101,2020-01-14T05:37:33Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,2
5reb0c_1,5reb0c,"I listened to Ready Player One and found myself harboring some mixed feelings about the book. I loved the world it was building but I felt like it was pandering to me with nostalgia as a way to avoid complex characters and/or in-depth plot lines.

Whenever H or Artemis interacted with Wade, their interactions were almost always summarized and glossed over. Wade and Artemis' relationship was practically reduced to cliff notes, in my opinion. H, who is supposedly Wade's closest friend, vanished for a majority of the book. For me, the plot tried to focus on people, who have never met in-person before, building bonds with another but it sort of lacked the necessary ingredients to build these bonds with the reader as well... or at least, with me.

For instance, Ready Player One reminded me of Sword Art Online, at first. Countless people being trapped in a VR-MMO who must band together and 'complete' the game in order to win their freedom. The issue is that Sword Art Online used that as a back drop for the interpersonal stories between each character while Ready Player One used interpersonal stories as back drop for the world it was building.

Don't get me wrong though. I enjoyed the book. It just felt like fluff or as if it tried to frantically pull a plot and some characters out of its nostalgia.",,2017-02-01T19:12:22Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,1

bln4bk_1,bln4bk,"That's an interesting reference to the German poem, (thanks for that) but I'm a bit skeptical of the author's knowledge of medieval literature.

Ernest Cline's domain seems to be video game, pop culture, and films.

*Excalibur*, directed by John Boorman, was a huge movie in the 80s, and growing up, even though it was an R-rated movie, all my friends and I would talk about it. It's a classic, and I just assumed that's where Cline got the Percival inspiration from.

Even though this was pre-Internet, there were still local BBS (bulletin board systems) that you could call with your computers in the 80s, and often times your username was taken so you had to come up with variations. Also there was this whole ""warez"" geek culture back then, way before l33t-speak became popular later in the 90s and 2000s. It was common to substitute letters for other letters or numbers, like changing ""Percival"" to ""Parzival"" so you'd sound cool online. Sometimes you'd come up with crazy ASCII animations on your username through the creative use of the backspace ASCII code.

As for *Ladyhawke*, even as a little kid, I think it was kinda obvious that the movie was romance fantasy than straight-up fantasy, but kids didn't care. I know I wasn't the only one who had a huge crush on a very young Michelle Pfeiffer.

While I liked *Ready Player One*, and like you, it got me out of a reading funk, I didn't really see much subtext in his writing.

You're right: he could have unintentionally wanted to write another kind of novel, but to me, it felt like he shoe-horned this romance angle into his plot. Cline's 80s geek knowledge is vast but his characterization skills were really a weak point for me -- something that is crucial when writing a romance story.

Boy-meets-girl is a common plot device, and I didn't ever get the feeling that Cline really put that much effort into the Art3mis character.

In fact, while I prefer the book to Speiberg's film-adaptation, I thought Spielberg did a better job at fleshing out Art3mis, giving her more of personality that was paper-thin in the book.",UltraFlyingTurtle,2019-05-07T08:59:32Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,1
bln4bk_2,bln4bk,"This is how I see the plot line of a ""chick flick"" (a term I don't like BTW) in general:

>!-Main character is alone/isolated, either metaphorically, or in reality.  
- Main character meets love interest...usually through chance, mutual friends or uncontrollable circumstances.  
- Main character secretly pines for the love interest, but uh-oh, they aren't interested.  
- Through repeated contact, communication, teasing, they slowly build up a pseudo-dating relationship.  ""What are we?"" ""I don't know"" ""Are you my girlfriend?"" ""No...he's not my boyfriend.""  ""We'd never.""  
- Some kind of breakdown in communication leads to the couple breaking up / parting ways / not seeing one another.  
- In the off time some sort of mutual problem enters their life, but they tackle it independently, or don't realize how it interconnects with their lives.  
- Fate, or the same set of circumstances that brought them together initially, once again bring the couple together to solve the problem.  The tension is thick, but you know they still love each other.   
- Through clenched teeth they work through the problem, exposing that deep down they did love each other.  There is probably some sort of ""well you are still a jerk"" kind of moment.  
- The problem is solved - cue hand-holding, kissing, wedding scene, whatever.!<

Now take that platform and apply it to Ready Player One.  I'm pretty sure you can find a scene that matches each element.  Also, take any Julie Roberts / Hugh Grant / Drew Barrymore film in the last 20 years and do the same.",wonderflex,2019-05-07T06:51:46Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,2

After a quick glance at the article I stumbled upon the below criticism which in my opinion is absolutely valid.

>The paragraph-long lists of Atari 2600 games and lengthy explanations of what Star Wars is raise the question of who, exactly, Cline was pandering to. If the target demographic was geeks born in 1972, why are even the most obvious references explained in excruciating detail? If Cline expected an audience unfamiliar with Atari, why laboriously shoehorn it into the plot at all?

I don't consider myself a huge nerd nor part of that culture but I felt like my intelligence was being insulted while reading Ready Player One. The book didn't reference pop culture of the 80's. It went out of its way to overly explain every reference within the book in nauseating fashion. That being said I have hope for the movie because Ernest Cline genuinely conceived an interesting world. I hope Spielberg will find a way to actually include an Easter Egg hunt/adventure within the movie and not rely on Deus Ex Machina plot devices to solve Wade's problems.

The ending was probably the worst thing I have ever read.

n7f24g_8,n7f24g,"I'm not sure how far this *Twilight* comparison will take you. The reason it appeals to people (and the reason that it appeals to the people that it does) has very little to do with what made *Ready Player One* so popular. (Though yes, I agree, RP1 is more guy-oriented and T is more girl-oriented, but it's not black and white.) But you also can't say that the sole reason people criticize RP1 is because it caters to the male adolescent experience.

Ultimately, different books balance different aspects to appeal to certain audiences more than others, and I wouldn't assume that people complain about RP1 without having read it. (To be totally honest, I had a pretty positive impression of the book prior to reading it.)

From what I understand, the uplifting aspects of RP1 are that A. it promotes technology and the virtual world as a way of advancing humankind and B. there are all sorts of cultural references (which are largely invisible to people outside of that bubble).

I will say though, the character of Aech was quite commendable. The author could have said a bit more, directly or indirectly, but it's something.

The whole scene where Wade goes into that arcade world and he's the only one there and plays Pac-Man... I actually got chills reading that for the first time. 

It really is more of a relating to the character and the badass situation he all the sudden finds himself in. 

I read a LOT and it's one of my favorite books in a long time. 

If you thought ready player one was a bit too young adult I would suggest the 'Otherland' series by Tad Williams. It's a bit more intense.

7j4hfn_3,7j4hfn,"Cline just lists a bunch of stuff you recognize for hundreds of pages and that made you like it. You didn't like the book. You liked the things he was referencing. It's easy to conflate the two. 

Compiling references doesn't make you a writer. And combining all of those references doesn't necessarily make a story. At most, he is an 80s/90s nostalgia curator. 

so, I think that's it. The story and the writing aren't what people love; the people love the beloved things he shoves in there. And it makes people feel like they're ""in"" on something because they get the (not at all obscure) references. 

Ready Player One is kind of the epitome of ""fast food"" reading. It's a trash book.

3d94yr_1,3d94yr,"> I know Reddit as a whole loves this book

This means in English: *avoid the book like the plague*. Books are the most absorbing medium which puts much greater strain on your brain, attention, imagination than any other medium - including an audiobook - so if statistically speaking you get unanimous acclaim that means that the book contains things easily understandable to many people.

""Many people"" statistically speaking are not very smart which means that something they can love must be something that they can understand *well*. So it must be something not very challenging or intelligent and this is why they fall in love with semi-retarded things like Twilight, Grey, etc. Hell, even Ready Player One or the Martian (although the Martian is a fairly decent first step towards proper hard sci-fi, don't know about RPO - don't plan on wasting time on it)

That scene where the protagonist wins the 'battle' of 80s trivia with that 'poser guy' was probably the most cringe-worthy scene I've ever read and cemented the opinion I had been forming since beginning the book enough to quit reading it.

And even if Cline *had* been perfectly prophetic about video game microtransactions, seeing this slide where nobody else did - and again, he wasn't - this is not even close to the kind of universal theme that would make a novel a ""must read."" It's greedy people getting greedy with video games, which has been a thing that has been going on since arcade cabinets first raised prices to play from 25 to 50 cents.

As u/MAGwastheSHIT brought up before, it also strongly correlates to the whole Net Neutrality deal currently happening, which is definitely an important thing to discuss on any internet platform.

I promise that my original goal was to start discussion about the book, not to wax the ego of the author or his work.

But I do disagree with you on the ""video games not being a universal experience"" statement. Virtually (no pun intended) every human being living in first-world conditions knows about and has played some form of a video game before. Whether it be Pong, Pac-man, Mario, Tetris, Farmville, Candy Crush, FIFA, or the newest Call of Duty, people have played it or have watched it being played by another. It's engrained in our society now.

""Ready Player One isn't a good book""...well I'm not going to tell you you're wrong if you want to be so dismissive. A bad book can get universal praise in the writing community for being nostalgic even if it does cater to a less mature crowd.
I did enjoy it and it allowed me to feel like a teenager who just wanted to be the hero of the story...again.

As for the topic itself: Microtransactions being commonplace has happened for a while now, true. That doesn't make it any less okay. In fact, it's the exact opposite. It's worse because people have gotten used to it. Quarter arcades WERE an exception because of what they were during the 80's and 90's: fun. Venues such as bars and theaters would use them for leisurely time-wasters, not grind-fests (unless you were a ""high-score hunter"" and the majority of people were not). When I was a kid, they were seen as an event rather than a transaction. Maybe I have rose-tinted glasses, but I just can't see arcades of old compared to modern gaming just because they both required money. That's also dismissive to say.",The-Dao,2017-11-15T04:34:19Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Ready Player One,3

The OASIS was created by a uber trillionaire who was obsessed with the 80s.  Movies, music, mostly video games.  He died and in the OASIS he hid an easter egg secret.  Easter Egg like in a movie.  This sets off the worlds biggest virtual treasure hunt.  The winner will get the creators fortune and be an OASIS celebrity.

jzu9if_8,jzu9if,"Ready Player Two is essentially a kaleidoscope of fan-fiction. Like *Ready Player One*, it is primarily interested in '80s pop culture, but in this novel, '90s cultural references are also emphasized. The novel sustains a fan-fictional foray into the worlds of [John Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Hughes%20(filmmaker))' movies, [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince%20(musician))'s music and star power persona, and J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth as described in [*The* *Silmarillion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Silmarillion). Yet, the most sustained media property that *Ready Player Two* pays homage to is *Ready Player One*. The sequel is a consistent paean to the former novel's narrative.

*Ready Player One* highlights its own failure as a creative or imaginative work. When Wade and company visit a section of the OASIS devoted to Hughes, Cline pays homage to Hughes' entire oeuvre, each work an original contribution to the body of '80s and '90s media so beloved by Halliday, Wade, and Cline. Wade meets John Hughes, who is typing out a screenplay in his home office. After the meeting, Wade looks longingly down the hall where Hughes works. In this transparent scene, Wade stands in for Cline, a fan-fic writer in awe of Hughes, a talent capable of creating compelling stories that don't rely on referencing the original works of others.

*Ready Player One*'s archenemy, Nolan Sorrento makes an appearance in the book. He does very little, but provides a cutting critique of the Ready Player franchise. Sorrento describes the world of the OASIS as pathetic, with its endless nostalgia for a bygone time.

jzu9if_15,jzu9if,"Let me clarify a few things for you all;

One, I'm female. Yep, I have a vagina and breasts! No, I'm not sending you pictures.

Two, I am a child of the 80s and perhaps it is aimed more at my generation as I do get more of the references than someone who wasn't exposed to that material. However I do have two boys who get a lot of the material as well because I've exposed it to them so this particular demographic isn't so narrowly targeted as someone suggested.

Three, I play video games. Lots of them on all sorts of platforms. Always have, probably always will.

Four, Twilight taught women and their daughters that it is okay to be stalked by a guy. As someone who has been violently stalked, this is NOT OKAY. I also read Anne Rice so that may have a small tiny weeny factor in part of my disgust of this series.

Five, well written means that it was composed in a [competent](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/competent), and often [entertaining](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/entertain), style. Which I do find Ready Player One was on both accounts. Forgive me if I do not find a vampire and werewolf fighting over the same Mary Sue exciting. Or don't. I found the nostalgia fun and laughed a few times when something popped up unexpectedly. Take the whole sequence with The Shining. If you haven't seen the movie and were in a situation where you had to play through the movie looking for something in particular, you can see how Aech could have faired much worse than they did. And yes that was entertaining. The fact that there are people out there who have no idea what The Shining is much less read the book or seen the movie entertains me. I'm also a horror fan and like reading Stephen King. Usually. He can ramble sometimes which is highly boring and annoying.

Six, virtual reality being better than reality. Say hello to 2020. I have seen on the oculus side of reddit many people saying they are only getting through this horrible year with VR. Some are stating they probably wouldn't be without one. This little opinion will entirely depend on your own reality. As someone who has an Oculus Quest, the biggest call of bullshit I have with RPO is the fact Wade played in a van. Like hell he did!!! There's not enough room, even with the moving floor! His hands would have hit the sides and the roof of the van more times than I want to count!! While I enjoy being in the Star Wars universe, it hasn't become better than my reality, but for some I can easily see how it might. And honestly, if there was a lot of money on the line, you may spend most of your time in VR trying to get the money. Or you might not. Again, your reality is different than anyone here.

Seven, why are you here? If you hated the first book so much, why are you here? Some of you mentioned other writers that are ""far better"" than Cline and that's fine, that's an opinion you have. A lot of the writers mentioned I haven't read. I never said Cline was the best writer in all the lands. I said he was better than the dumbasses who wrote Twilight and 50 Shades. And I will stand by that 100%. But it makes little sense to me why you would come here to a thread that obviously is going to talk about something you dislike to shit on someone else's opinion of the thing you dislike.

jx3ck_1,jx3ck,"As of the time of my writing this, this link was submitted over two weeks ago.  I'm still going to type this out in the hopes that I save someone from making the mistake I did and reading this.  It's garbage.  Here's why.

Do you like trivia?  Or Jeopardy, or really any type of quiz show?  There's often somebody involved in those tests that just crushes the competition.  You can't fault them for their knowledge, but they're sort of insufferable.  **Ready Player One** is about a virtual world of people with encyclopedic knowledge of trash culture, and asks you to care about them.  I can't.  I bought it because the description I read of it (a review other than this one) sounded amusing.  Whoops.

Cline has written a novel which doesn't stand on the shoulders of giants, but instead uses their decades-old footprints as a playground.  The Metaverse--I'm sorry, the *OASIS* is a post-internet virtual reality structure that people use for communication, education, games, and sexual fulfillment.

I mostly want to know why it isn't shelved as YA.
