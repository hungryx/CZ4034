9ocop7_1,9ocop7,"I read Dune when I was 15 (I'm almost 50 now) and it shaped my life. It's by far my favorite and most re-read series of books. It taught me to be skeptical of religion and politics and to always try to understand the motives and history  behind why people believe what they believe and do what they do.

The most important life lesson though came from this quote ""And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning 'That path leads ever down into stagnation'"". I've tried very hard to not get complacent with life. And to always make hard choices that lead me to growth and change, instead of just doing what's easy/less effort.

9ocop7_2,9ocop7,"Is this some kind of Dune revival? There was another post about Dune recently.

I can only second what gristmill and stringdreamer stated. For me, it was also a book that shaped my life. I read it when I was 14-15, first as an adventure book, then as a romance, a book about politics, religion, and finally a book about what power does to you as a human. Yes, Paul becomes almost a monster because, at least in Herbert's opinion, that's what power does to you, especially if combined with religion - so that's one of key messages of the book.",skinnyraf,2018-10-15T14:22:11Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2
9ocop7_3,9ocop7,"You should read the rest of the Frank Herbert Dune books, it goes even deeper, with Paul struggling with his new station and holding his empire and throne together, and the consequences of his actions during his rise to power and rule, as well as the ramifications of being a messianic figure to the Fremen and the Kwisatz Haderach.

9ocop7_5,9ocop7,"Hi! It's great to hear the book has such an impact on you. I've been reading and studying it over 20+ years and still find new things in it every time. The rest of the series kicks butt too and fills in a lot of the meaning of what happened in Dune.

Of the points that disappoint you, it's funny, because Frank went out of his way to show Dune as being a story about the usual flow of stories. Paul isn't just someone leading a people to freedom; he's someone who realizes that he's been destined to do this, and struggles against *whether he should*. And the more time that goes the less choice he has, especially as he begins to adopt the mentality of 'a winner', which requires acting now and mourning later. Both the death of his father and of his son are given almost no time, and it's because he *can't afford to take the time* for them. We see his POV, in effect. And I think it's sad to think that Paul can't afford to be sad and give these things their time.

The ending also comes to a close quite quickly without much pomp, and although this may feel like it almost lacks a denouement, the effect is meant to show how unfinished the story is; that we are only meant to understand how one very specific turning point came about. And I think it lacks pomp because from Paul's POV the ending is the story of his failure, not his victory. He *fails to stop* the coming Jihad because it served his purpose too much to stay on the path that would lead to it. Viewed as a failure ending it makes sense to have it lack a certain 'triumphant happy ending' feel. Even Chani doesn't exactly have a happy ending, learning her fate is to be a royal concubine.

There's a lot more in here than just mythology; there's a story about someone who knows he's being trapped into a mythology and assesses the possible ways to avoid it, all of which seem even worse to him. ",George0fDaJungle,2018-10-15T16:43:17Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,5

After read the book, he \*rewrote\* some key parts of his research, now on Herbert's influence, changing the aesthetic elements and, of course, about human behavior.

9ocop7_10,9ocop7,"All the same thoughts as you, an amazing thrill.

edit: if you fall for the temptation to look for film versions, you may well be a bit disappointed. There's really two main versions:

- the David Lynch movie, and its fan recuts

- the Dune miniseries, 2 series of 3 parts each

Because of how vast the universe is, it's extremely hard to compress to a normal-length movie. They might still be of interest just to illustrate different approaches and choices in filmmaking - the David Lynch movie comes across as a more well-resourced and glossy but heavily cut down ""Hollywood"" take on Dune, and the miniseries (Frank Herbert's Dune, 277 minutes + Children of Dune 250 minutes) being much more sober. I'm happy that I saw both and can compare them.

9ocop7_12,9ocop7,"Within the series as a whole, the function of *Dune* seems to be to give the desires for revenge, glory, and empire their due, because those desires and the prospect of their satisfaction are powerful in us. In fact, the desires are so powerful that the prospect of their satisfaction diverts our attention from what must follow. Before reading *Dune Messiah*, consider re-reading *Dune*, looking for and thinking over any indications that events may take a dark turn for Paul after he gets what he wants.",duncans_gardeners,2018-10-15T20:30:30Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,12
9ocop7_13,9ocop7,"I just finished Dune for the first time last week, so I have to comment. First of all I don't know how I managed to avoid reading it all these years but now that I finally did I'm kinda disappointed. It's not bad, I would still recommend it to any sci-fi guy. I think it has some amazing segments and ideas but overall I think there are so many characters I just didn't care about at all and the execution of many key moments were really drab and anticlimactic. 

I can see why its considered a classic and I do absolutely recognize the influence it has had on the genre but I just don't think it's that enjoyable a read and probably won't read the rest of the series.

9ocop7_14,9ocop7,"In my humble opinion Frank Herbert wasn't a great writer (he wasn't bad by any means), but he was a masterful worldbuilder. He created this deeply complex and thoughtful scifi world that really hasn't ever been matched. I think it's fair to say that Dune has some fairly underwhelming prose but it's not really about that, Dune, to me atleast, is a story that's more than just the sum of its parts. 


It's a book that got me thinking about ecology, destiny and even the inherent ""strangeness"" of the far future. There's not really any other sci-fi that can do that to me.",TEcksbee,2018-10-15T15:53:51Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,14

9ocop7_19,9ocop7,"I read it for the first time at the end of middle school, and many times since. It shaped my life in a lot of ways and has remained my favourite book. I recently bought a new copy since my original is falling apart. 

I recommend reading the rest of the series written by Frank Herbert, including Eye (one of the short stories takes place in Arrakis). The Dune Cyclopedia is also great. If you still love the series after that and want more, then dip into the books written by his son and Kevin J. Anderson.

9ocop7_26,9ocop7,"For me, my favorite part is the writing style. You don't see ""third person omniscience"" very often and I revel when I get the opportunity to read that writing style. It allows the reader to enter the heads and know the thoughts of every character. This is especially apparent in scenes with The Barron. That writing style appeals to me more than first or second person do or even first person limited like Harry Potter. 

It's bound to be hard for readers, jumping between characters so often, but I feel like Dune did a good job using the italics to highlight character thoughts. That alone would probably make turning this book into an extremely hard project. How do you convey to a movie viewer internal thoughts. There are ways but they definitely present a problem to the director. ",The-Insolent-Sage,2018-10-15T20:42:08Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,26

I don’t think anything else has had a greater impact on my one thought process, how I process my experience of reality, how I evaluate the geopolitics, and so many other philosophical concepts. It led me on so many paths, which were only beginnings. I’ve read all the books by Frank, and his son. The ones by him are the best, and each in their own way worth reading Jd you’ve had this experience. I read the first book twice before I moved on, and then j read the first three twice, and then I read the fourth by about 21, and then just a few years ago finished the extended books.

9ocop7_30,9ocop7,"Dude. There’s so much to unpack. The thing that always strikes me about Dune is that I considered many of the concepts to be reletively recent when I read it in the nineties. The idea of needing a solution to interstellar travel, the gender dynamics, the war in Iraq, the idea that ecology ties into every aspect of the story, the respect for unfamiliar cultures and the idea that religion was a tool to shape the future. And here Frank Herbert was writing about these things back in the sixties?! I’m always impressed by it. 

And that’s not to even mention the really awesome, unique ideas in the story. I was amazed at the idea of Alia being fully conscious even before she was born and being angry at her body because it couldn’t do what she wanted it to. Then she turns into a complete, disembowling badass. The religion one really stuck with me though. The idea that the Bene Gesserit would implant the motifs of their religion in the culture a thousand years earlier on the off chance that they would ever need to manipulate it for their own purpose.

 I love how everything that's mentioned- the detail of the stillsuits, the texture of the different cultures, the feints-within-feints, is something a *character is noticing*. Anything that gets examined in detail is something a character is examining in detail. It avoids the trope of sci-fi of over-explaining things that aren't relevant to them.

9ocop7_53,9ocop7,When I had finally gotten around to reading Dune a few years ago I was really enamored and impressed with it and during a conversation with a former roommate books came up and I gushed about how great Dune was and how I really respected its unique place as a literary classic. This conversation somehow turned into a huge argument/fight because she refused to acknowledge that Dune or anything that could be considered genre fiction deserves the same respect as other fiction. She went on and on about how 'Dune was not impressive from a literary stand point and no one would teach Dune in a high school english class.' Out of curiosity I googled the most popularly taught books in high school english classes and Dune was in fact in the top 150 or so... That did nothing to win me the argument and I could never bring up Dune again in my apartment or even around my girl friend (our roommate was also her best friend and she would often take her side on petty arguments like this) because I was somehow the jack ass. I think people underestimate Dune for being fantasy/sci-fi in nature but really it's bigger than that in my opinion. Dune is massively underrated and doesn't get the respect it deserves. I think that ficiton literature as whole (not just genre fiction) and popular culture would look completely different today if Dune didn't exist. ,metalciscokid,2018-10-15T15:18:36Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,53

9ocop7_83,9ocop7,"I share the enthusiasm. Dune is probably my favorite work of fiction, and while I like the other Frank Herbert written entries to the series, I enjoy them less and less as they progress. That first novel hints at so many interesting and Baroque details to the setting, but fills very few of them out as complete structures, and in doing so allows the reader's imagination to paint the picture they want to see in the margins. As the novels continue, the areas left to the reader's own fancies are revealed more and more to be something concretely defined by the author, and thus the universe becomes less a collaboration of imagination and more the rigid structure of the author's sculpted vision. For me, I can compartmentalize my appreciation of Frank Herbert's Dune series. I can enjoy Dune as a work unto itself with no set continuation of its worlds and characters. I can also appreciate the novels up to the end of God Emperor as a complete story of how humanity, with the aid of prescient martyrs, was able to narrowly avoid its own stagnation and extinction. That's really where it ends for me though. I didn't really care for the books which followed God Emperor of Dune, and the novels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson read like bad fan-fiction to me.

Most people really really enjoy the first book, but then loose interest in the sequels.  As OP pointed out, the ending breezes by potentially huge portions of the story.  How does Paul organize the Fremen into this devastating offensive?  What else is happening behind Frank Herbert's curtain that the reader just has to guess?  Only after reading the sequels does the reader get the chance to understand why the story was told this way.  The first book was simply establishing the stage on which Herbert planned to play out numerous philosophical 'What ifs?'  I strongly recommend reading through the next two books, at least.

The best comparison I can make to Dune is that it's Game of Thrones in Space. But should you venture into the Dune Universe, pick up and read Paul of Dune first. According to what I've learned, Paul of Dune was originally part of the initial Dune book but was cut for content. Brian Herbert, his son, and Kevin Anderson worked together to fill the void between Dune and Dune Messiah. As for Dune Messiah, what I said in comparing Dune to Game of Thrones becomes relevant after about 20 pages. Go in this order: Dune, Paul of Dune, Dune Messiah, Winds of Dune, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, Chapterhouse Dune, Hunters of Dune, and finally Sandworms of Dune.

9ocop7_125,9ocop7,"I finished reading Dune late last year, and since then I have read Dune Messiah, Children of Dune and God Emperor of Dune. I'm taking a break from the Duneverse after finishing God Emperor last month and am reading Robin Hobb's 'Assassin's Apprentice' book now.

I quite enjoy the series, but there are some things I don't like about it (although perhaps these threads are picked up in Chapterhouse and Heretics).

Likes:

- Love the setting
- The main players: the Guild, the Tleilaxu, the Bene Gesserit are cool and interesting and seem to act like real factions or organisations do in the real world to a degree
- Sandworms!
- The political intrigues
- The exploration of the limits and shortfalls of clairvoyance
- The Litany Against Fear is amazing.

Dislikes:

- The political intrigue between the great houses is underdeveloped
- Herbert's prose sometimes seems more like a philosophical lecture than a narrative. He reminds me of Ayn Rand in that sense.
- The setting is underdeveloped. The almost total lack of technology makes it hard to feel like the time-skjps in the series actually happened. Like the time between Children and God Emperor should make for a very different feeling setting, but it doesn't really.
- I'd love to see the factions more developed themselves.

That said, I have immensely enjoyed reading the books, and even made my own House Atreides hoodie.

If you like Dune, you will probably also like Dune: Messiah, and Children of Dune. They are all roughly in the same overall story arc.

God Emperor of Dune is set 10,000 years later and is a very different kind of story, but probably my favorite of Herbert's after Dune. 

After that they get pretty trippy, but frankly I enjoyed them all.

Dune shows the corruption of being a hero and having followers who latch on and grow into something unintended, as well as the dangers of reverently following a hero without question. I think it's an important thing to say, especially considering Hebert's familiarity with US and middle-eastern relations. It's a book that seems to become more relevant with time. We could all be Fremen at the mercy of a hero, or we could be the enemies cut down and subjugated until we find our own hero.

9ocop7_156,9ocop7,"Dune is the best, Heretics of Dune a very close if not immediate second. I think of Heretics of Dune as the actual part 2, or the same as the original but with more history behind it. Chapterhouse Dune was, basically an end of days take, sort of nothing left to say. God Emperor is one of the most lackluster tales. Think of the Deathly Hallows part one. Lots of ego, not much real story, vague history and immediate, predictable conclusion.  Children of Dune was very, very good. It’s a twin tale, if you have a sibling, it’s very shareable, if you have a twin it’s very relatable. 

Frank Herbert created an incredible and extremely developed canon, that spanned beyond our current history. He took us thousands of years away, none of this 2048 nonsense. He also showed us our actual history, he related through the, bene gesserit, the hereditarical, history of humanity. He took us through actual and real, applied sciences, the mentat and guild. He walked us through the future of the acceptance of violence in a gladiatorial arena, and how assassins abound. He wrote and followed a great canon, not unoriginal at all, however it’s a common, one. The hero, yet a “privileged hero, who loses everything, especially his childhood, while still a child.” Sounding familiar yet?
Don’t say Simba, please don’t! I beg of you! Next he must overcome great hardship, after his initial loss, while saving his own mother, whom he’s managed to escape with. If this isn’t familiar, then someone scream Oedipus, please for the love of Harry Potter! Next comes Juliet, I meant Chani. You know, the girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Lots more Hamlet, a little more Greek tragedy, and Voila’! You have the Dune series. The thing that makes Frank Herbert a fantastic story teller, is the original construction of the universe it all resides in. He created a dictionary, made it up, and made it relatable, HE GENE RODDENBURIED IT!
 All jokes aside, I love these books! Theyare fond friend and much revisited friends. I wish I could have met the man himself, apparently he was a very capable person beyond his story telling.

9ocop7_181,9ocop7,"In retrospect, for me, the best part of the Dune series was Herbert's unwillingness to compromise. He built a world that manifested itself as reality on the page. If the reality swung a way the reader might have been dissatisfied with it was because that's how the reality swung. Paul gets brutal in the sequel and his world reacts according to the jihad. It's amazing and so enduring. ",,2018-10-16T06:10:27Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,181

9ocop7_189,9ocop7,"I feel like I’m the only person on Reddit who was properly underwhelmed by Dune. It had its moments, but I found the dialogue to be so dense and complicated that I had to re-read several conversations just to make sense of all the made up words that were thrown in. At the same time, the descriptions were often so vague I found it very difficult to picture how or where the action was taking place, which made the majority of the more action focused sequences fall flat as the characters scrabbled around an entirely shapeless environment.

I remember reading a sequence at a dining table (forgive me if this is wrong it was a while ago I read it) where several characters were discussing the possibility of cultivating an infinite source of water on Dune and the economic and environmental impact it would have. THAT sequence was so well written, tense and engrossing that I was sold on the book, but it never again hit those dramatic heights, which was really disappointing.

Admittedly I was working incredibly long hours at the time and may not have had the head space required for such a complex narrative, but I don’t know if I could find the motivation to try it again when there’s so much other great sci-fi/fantasy I haven’t read any of yet.",DiscoStuUK,2018-10-16T08:30:21Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,189

9ocop7_267,9ocop7,"At this point I am going to chime in with a controversial opinion.

Brain Herbert has written (IMHO) some great prequels to Dune In The Machine War/ Butlerian Jihad books and the House books, Atreides, Harkonnen and Corrino. They supply a wonderful addition to Frank's works.

The Machine Wars deal with Humanities struggle against Omnius a renegade A.I who has enslaved most of humanity, his ally subset Erasamus and the evil Cymeks. The cymeks are former humans whose brains have been implanted in preservation canisters, which in turn can be installed into a variety of fearsome mechanical bodies, to extend their lives indefinitely and make them nearly unstoppable.

During the trilogy you learn of how the feud between Atreides and Harkonnen starts and the origins of the different Schools and Guilds. I give it 4 of 5 stars.

The House books deal with the palace and political intrigues leading directly into Dune itself.

I would however recommend reading through Children of Dune before taking the detour though.

Once finished with that move on to Frank's several smashing sequels and then Brian's take on where the whole thing ends up many thousands of years in the future.

9ocop7_272,9ocop7,"I've only read Dune and none of the rest of the series, but I have a similar take as you. I can see why it's impactful for so many, I can see the messages behind the story, and how impressive it is in it's scope. It's a lesson about what humans do with power and what power does to humans. It's a interesting world filled with symbolism and irony, and the universe is easy to get lost in.

BUT

I was bored the whole time reading the book. It took me so many tries to get through it. I've been trying since high school and only over a decade later, last summer, was I able to actually finish it. What I've narrowed my problems with it down to are extremely subjective, but I don't think I'm the only one who probably feels that way. 

There's very little character development. Everyone is dictated by destiny, and to me, that makes their choices and decisions feel cheap. The relationships between people seem forced and contrived with the exception of Paul and Jessica, but even then it feels flat to me, because Paul as a whole feels very flat. The most relatable character IMO was Jessica but the only real dynamic relationship we see her in is the one with her son, and again, it's flat. Reading *Dune* felt like I was just watching all these things happen around me and I wasn't really given a reason to care.

For me, too, the themes that are dominant in the story I've seen represented in sci-fi and fantasy elsewhere in ways that I think get the point across in more intriguing ways with characters I like better. I think I differ in my opinion here from.many because I came to it so late, while many die hard fans read it when they we're either younger or just breaking into the genre and this is their first exposure to the concepts behind the story.

I'd recommend it to people who ask because it's a staple of the genre and it's enlightening to read it and see it's influence elsewhere, but personally, it wasn't my cup of tea.",kaz3e,2018-10-16T00:31:01Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,272

So, here's the thing, the way they deal with it in Dune assumes you're willing to fight, at which point you maximize your advantage by facing the door and getting as much of a heads up to what's coming as possible. 

If you're not, you can still set up your space so you are almost sideways to the door, at a slight angle, such that any ""visitor"" needs to walk in to face you, giving you the chance to run sideways, possibly push a desk or whatever at them. 

Back to the door is still the most vulnerable position, as it still allows someone to approach you with the minimum of notice.

Perhaps it was because I went into it thinking it would be as decent as any other book adaptation instead of expecting it to be super wierd and go straight from normal to ascended Jesus of space in the span of ten minutes.",,2018-10-15T19:10:09Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,310

ahrrvk_11,ahrrvk,"Congrats!  Dune is one of those books that would be first on my list to forget everything about just so I could have the pleasure of reading it for the first time again.  I absolutely loved the original, so much so that after I read it I followed it with every book in the series.  And when I finished with the original series I followed that with everything written by his son and Anderson. (This was back in 2012 or so so is missing a few books, at some point I plan to catch up again).  And while none of the other books individually was better than the original they were all still pretty good to great reads, most likely because they had such a fantastic universe to build upon.  For me at least continuing to read more books in the same universe let me continue to enjoy many of the things that I love about Dune in different ways.

So I might be the lone voice in this, but take everything you've heard with a grain of salt and keep going as long as you continue enjoying it.  I will agree that Messiah tends to drag a bit and is probably the low point of the original series, so its worth a bit off effort to get through because it means getting to read 3 and 4 especially.

Anything not written by Frank takes a bit to get used to because of the change in style.  If you do go that route you should probably aim to read them in the order they were written.  There's little Easter eggs and tie ins added as they go that while not important do add a bit when you understand them.  I will say out of those my favorite set is the ones set during the butlerian jihad.

Have fun!

Also, if you're into board games and have 5 other friends that are too the Dune boardgame is absolutely fantastic and easily a 10/10 as well.  Its hard to find an original copy of but its not bad to print and play.  And Rex doesn't compare if anyone tries to tell you it's been remade with a different theme.",techiesgoboom,2019-01-20T03:35:36Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,11

I have found your enjoyment of books 2 & 3 really depend on *you*.

People who love Dune Messiah & Children of Dune (books 2 & 3) tend to find God Emperor (book 4) a bit heavy to wade through. Those who find Books 2 & 3 not as enjoyable as the first book tend to LOVE book 4.

I fall into the first category. But - I love them all, and have read Frank's Dune series (all six books) over 20 times in the past 30 years. I love it SO much, I even have read the Brian Herbert (his son co-authored with Kevin Anderson, allegedly based on Frank's back-story notes - some call them awful) books. While not NEARLY as good as Frank's work, and contain a few *glaring* problems with the canon - I still enjoyed them for what they were - the only way to consume some new Dune-world material.

I'm also SUPER PUMPED about the new Dune movie(s!!!) they are making ( [The New Dune Movie](https://nerdist.com/dune-remake-everything-we-know-so-far/) ). Loved the first Dune movie, and even the Dune SyFy TV mini-series.

ahrrvk_128,ahrrvk,"The first book was the hardest, but damn is it incredible. I've read through God Emperor (4th book) and would recommend you go at least that far. Without any spoilers: book 2 is a different pace from 1.  It's a noticeably different feel. To use ASOIAF as an analogy it's the difference between Robert's rebellion and ""game of thrones"" (aka book 1). It's not a bad book but comparing messiah to children, emperor, and Dune, it's probably the weakest. That being said, children and god emperor are almost as incredible as the first book and what transpires in messiah is crucial to the others and is a fair bit of world building. Children is very well done and will have you thrilled that you didn't stop earlier. When I finished children, and started god emperor, I ended up going back and rereading Dune, as the events of messiah and children, as well as the premise for God Emperor, made me want to check dune for foreshadowing etc. And boy... It does not disappoint. (One last note about Messiah: consider how different in tone Star Wars A New Hope was from Empire Strikes Back. One ends with Luke blowing up the death star, the next ends with Han being frozen and Luke getting a proverbial bomb dropped on him.)

But all of that aside, Dune is absolutely incredible, and the rare case where everyone who calls it a classic is not exaggerating. The amount of modern media that finds some root in it is astounding. Clearly star wars wouldn't exist without it, but that's a glaring comparison. A song of ice and fire (the faceless men were just medieval face dancers, but those guys aren't as detailed in book 1 iirc), or even how the butlerian jihad likely inspired a fair bit of the matrix. It's not hard to start making connections.

But perhaps what got me the most about the series, is the depiction of the bene gesserit. They talk about seeding planets with these myths of a savior coming from the stars, a child of a weirding woman, as something they did as some kind of emergency survival mechanism should anyone need it. The BG's are revealed to be shrewd, calculating, and manipulative. It does not paint a favorable picture of organized religion in a way few works of fiction accomplish, even down to Paul worrying before his duel that regardless of the outcome, he'll be worshipped as a god and a jihad will run in his name. If he wins ""no one can stop him!"" If he loses ""he was a great martyr who sacrificed himself for us!""

Also, did you have any thoughts while reading it about how ungodly difficult it'll be for them to translate it to screen? All the visions, all the hand signals, etc. I don't think it'll be impossible but good hell those people have a lot on their plates 😆 they look like they're doing ok on the casting so far",clamroll,2019-01-21T00:17:07Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,128

ahrrvk_134,ahrrvk,"I have a question. I wanted to read dune, mostly due to the weekly ""I just read dune, wow!"" Posts, but I can't get into it. I love sci-fi and fantasy in movies/games, but every time I try to READ sci-fi (starting with dune) I feel like I'm just absorbing words without any real direction. Let me try to explain..

This is non-spoiler, as I didn't get past 30 pages deep.
___
Sci-fi has this trope of over-complicating things/names/terminology/descriptions for no reason. Even after rereading a paragraph multiple times to combat the inevitable ""who is this dude again? What's the (insert unrelatable sci-fi term) again?"", I still fall short.

There was this dope scene where the kid (who's name I can't recall, and who's story made no sense to me) put his hand in this box thing that was impossible to imagine. I really tried, but I could only imagine a cube that had a Looney tunes hole on one side. The kid puts his hand in for a.. test? That some random lady who showed up the day before administered. It was obvious it wasn't actually harming him, because he's the chosen one or something, and it spent multiple pages talking about and describing the affected hand in overly convoluted ways. In short, it was a box that simulated pain that, if you can handle the pain, you're special.

Question time: (not really looking for answers specifically, I'm displaying my questions so you can get a frame of reference for what I don't understand, so hopefully I can figure out why I don't understand it)
___
Who is this lady? The book says nothing that comes to mind. Dude I don't remember how she even got to the kids place. The first thing I remember about the scene is her peaking into his room and talking to his mom. Again, if it said, ""old lady flew in on spaceship"", I'd remember. So if something like that happened, I could only assume the overly complicated scene made me concentrated on things other than picturing the story itself and if so whyyyyy. Do I just have selective reading where I only remember inessential details? Because that's surely useful, dumb brain.

Why is this lady even here?

How'd she learn about the boy?

She knows the mom somehow, maybe Facebook idk

What the hell does this house look like? 

Leaving me to create an entire artificial scene in my head whilst spending paragraphs describing a little cube is like tying my shoes together before starting a race. And even if I get the finish line, my shoes are still tied and it took forever to get to the 10 yard line, and wasn't enjoyable at all. Like.. can someone help me untie my shoes so I can run freely with this marathon? I don't think telling me who these characters or motives are is going to fix anything, I'm more so looking for an answer to my lack of comprehensive reading outside of ""read it again"". It's like looking at art once it's finished and being forced to attempt to describe it without ever seeing it before. A book should paint the picture with you, and use your imagine as the canvas.

Oh, and then after the cube scene, there were new characters in a new chapter with unmemorable names and unimaginable dialogue in a scene that I couldn't picture. I think maybe there was a globe?

Been awhile, but, from memory - A Reverend Mother from the Order Jessica, Paul's mother, is a member of.  Not sure if/where that is actually explained in that particular book.  Not sure it's overly important for the first novel (but of some significance in later (and earlier) novels).

ahrrvk_193,ahrrvk,"Start with Dune, the first book (stands alone just fine). If you like it then you continue with Dune Messiah and Children of Dune (decent place to stop). If you still want more then you read God Emperor of Dune (another okay place to stop). Finally there is Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune. Those are the six original books written by Frank Herbert. And while the 6th ends without wrapping things up completely, it's perfectly good to just come up with your own ending from there. Each book in the series has it's own particular theme and tone, so don't expect just more of the same as you go on.

But, if you really want more of the Dune universe, then you can try out the other books written by Frank's son Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson. Those are best read in the order they were published - the Houses trilogy (the histories of the main characters of book 1), the Jihad trilogy (ancient history of this world), then the two-part finale to the main series. There are more after that but I haven't bothered with them.

Brian and KJA's style is very different from Frank's. Many find it inferior - it's certainly more focused on action than the depth and thought of the original books.

ahrrvk_231,ahrrvk,"Science fiction is science and technology based. Science fantasy is fantasy in a futuristic setting. Most of Dune is science fantasy because of all the space magic people can do after exposure to worms and spice, which has no possible grounding in reality or physics and isn't supposed to.

There's many examples of the line being blurry but on the side of sci-fi because of how the author portrays it, IE ""sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic *for undeveloped cultues*"". Examples include Might and Magic universe and Stargate universe.

Fantasy is not meant to be explained or reasonable. GRRM has been very clear that we will never get an explanation for why dragons can breath fire or why red priests can resurrect the dead, and no explanation exists in his mind. It's just magic. Because it's a fantasy story.

Asimov did both genres. Most of the Robot stories are sci-fi, and so is the first 1.5 books of Foundation, but after that he introduces things like telepathy and telekinesis with no attempt to ground it in reality, so it becomes science fantasy.",,2019-01-20T06:41:33Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,231

This is different from hard science fiction which is much more grounded in scientific reality and scientific theory. Science Fantasy - like Star Wars, uses tropes of science fiction but acknowledges to some degree that the speculative parts of the story are rooted in magic as a plot device rather than science. 

Dune is not a space fantasy. It’s light sci-fi, as opposed to say, 2001 A Space Odyssey which is more hard sci-fi. ",mynemesisjeph,2019-01-20T07:41:15Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,232

o3inkb_22,o3inkb,"I'm yet to read Dune. It sits at the periphery of my Fantasy / Sci-fi love as a historical monument to one day be appreciated and, indeed, one day I shall pick it up.

Until then, I fell face first into Sarah J. Maas's Throne of Glass series. Maas made me fall in love with fiction again once I realised just how glorious, how powerful, and how fallible her heroine was. The multi-faceted layers of her cast drew me back not only to reading but also to writing. Her ""so what"" mentality was a breath of fresh air.

o3inkb_30,o3inkb,"In my experience the first three Dune books were insanely exciting to read. But there was a big part of the books that was so bad it made the read rather challenging. The science fiction, the universe building, the political intrigue, the ecological-ideological development, it's all fascinating. But, speaking from the millennial male perspective, the constant barrages of barbarically patriarchal themes were nauseatingly intense. Like holy shit everyone and every assumption in the society is sexist AF and the women only exist to make babies and tell lies. It gives the whole series a slimy feel, I imagine more unpleasant than a sandtrout touching the skin.",particlemanwavegirl,2021-06-19T17:41:47Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,30

I recently started reading a lot again, but I started with a lot of easy-reading Stephen King books which in hindsight was a good thing. I enjoyed the first Dune book, much less so the second, but about 100 pages into the third one I'm liking it a lot more than Messiah. **But** had I restarted reading with Dune as my first book I fear I would have given up. It's pretty heavy going, in terms of a dense plot with a lot of unfamilar, made-up vocabulary. (I discovered the dictionary in the appendix about half way through, it would have been very helpful for that to have been pointed out in a preface at the start!)

o3inkb_39,o3inkb,"Had this exact experience back in March. Five years of collegiate literature curriculum, a nervous breakdown, and a year of deep depression basically killed any motivation I had for reading on my own time. My local library started opening up around February, so I decided to look around and see if anything jumped out at me. Passed by a thick paperback of Dune and thought I'd check it out. I hadn't really read any SF since high school, so I figured that it might be a good way to ease myself back into recreational reading. 

I plowed through it in just a few weeks. I'm usually a slow reader, so I expected to be on it for months. I was so utterly captivated by the story that by the time I was only a quarter of the way through it, I returned the library copy and bought my own from the local Barnes & Noble. I've since read about five or six other books in the few months since I finished Dune, and it really feels like I've reclaimed something lost. I've also picked up a copy of the first sequel, but I'm saving it until I've finished the other books I bought in the excitement for my new-old hobby.",ProseBros,2021-06-19T21:42:25Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,39

Bad part: there are VERY few books I've read that are such a balanced mix of topics as Dune that are as excellently written. Frank Herbert very much captured lightning in a bottle with the first Dune novel. The rest of the series is worth reading if you love the universe and for some interesting/intriguing characters and concepts. But rhe first book is very much the highpoint of the series.

But not once in the three novels I read did a single character, male or female, consider the idea, that a woman could be the first post-human, a ruler, leader, role model, or even really act under her own self-determination, as plausible. It is considered more likely that a woman is possessed by the spirits of her dead ancestors than acting as she willed. Sure, maybe in the narrative they were correct, but the contextual assumption is there and it's insane. The concept of womanly autonomy is implicitly refuted in many ways and IIRC is explicitly mentioned once or twice at least.

The contrary idea, a male savior to provide that autonomous, truly free will, an act of pure creation only achievable by a true, male god-post-human, is literally the central theme in the trilogy.

They completely chopped out the Guild Navigators.  Paul threatening to destroy the spice was what stopped the Great Houses since they had no transportation.  I was OK with Paul killing the Baron instead of his sister since they collapsed time down to less than 9 months.

Of course like any book to film adaptation, not everything will be accurate, or the same but in this case I have to say it's quite on point. In Dune II, Chani's character isn't the same compared to in the novel. The importance of water isn't really depicted the same either. A lot of people might disagree but I think watching the movie before reading the book might actually give you a pass. When I first read Dune, I was lost. I watched the first movie, and re-read the book and it made it much easier to understand every character, culture, politics and history of Dune.

Edit: I'd also like to mention how Jessica is portrayed in the film isn't the same in the books either. Princess Irulan is way better in the film compared to reading her excerpts in the first book and in Messiah too. If you read Messiah, you'll see Irulan has more of a voice in the book (I'm only 70 pages in, so far it's great). Paul isn't meant to be a hero, but the complete opposite.

That said, even without having finished the book, the second movie (or at least the second half of the second movie) felt very rushed to me. I thought Where the Crawdads Sing would have worked much better as a limited series rather than a movie to capture the slowness and the environmental detail that I found so enjoyable in the book (also the movie sucked in about 19 other big ways, but that's another post).

I adore Dune the book, but the prose and style made it hard for me to really picture a lot of it in my head. The film solves that problem - Villeneuve's vision and artistic style (and the soundtrack/sound design!) are just amazingly rich and vibrant and feel like they *match* the themes and ideas so well. When I reread the book after the first film, Villeneuve's vision is what I pictured, and it was wonderful.

Meanwhile, the film by necessity must cut and rework a lot of what made the book so deeply engaging. A lot of themes and ideas and characters get lost on the wayside. By reading the book as well, it takes what you may have loved about the movie and adds a dozen more layers of depth to it all. That is a wonderful thing.

You really do get a feast for the mind and soul by combining the strengths of both and enjoying them as complementary works.

1bqmdwj_19,1bqmdwj,"Dune 1 & 2 are Books telling a Man's Story . Dune I ( the Movie, haven't seen 2 yet ) makes the Story a Women's Story . That is just Zeitgeist, nothing great about, and for my taste a bit too much ""adapting"" the source Material .

The overly friendly, touchy feely relations Paul has in Dune I the Movie with 2 of his trainers - Duncan and Gurney - is absolutely ridiculous . In the Universe of Dune, noone ( absolutely noone ) would get as touchy comfy  - and especially not in public - with the heir of the most popular, honourable, and one of the most powerfull Houses . Even his mother and father do not.

These are just 2 examples, the Movie changed the Story in a few more moments and ways which I did not appreciate .

Then on the other Hand, some scenes and dialogue are taken from the source 100%, or almost. Which gives the movie a lot of credibility . All in all, I liked watching it .

Generally, I do not think Frank Herbert's work needs any kind of ""adaption"" or rewriting . Change of Characters, change of initial Setout and other things are completely unnecessary . Stay truthfull to the source as much as apossible is what I prefer .

But, as mentioned above - Zeitgeist . People who are not able to come up with a monnumental Work like Dune themselves nevertheless think they can ""make it better"" by ""adapting"" it . What a time to be alive .",Kastergir,2024-03-29T18:58:05Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,19
1bqmdwj_20,1bqmdwj,"I liked the book better. With that said, I loved the movie and thought Villeneuve's changes were really smart. (Everything from pruning down the characters and plots, to giving more nuance to the Freemen via the believers and skeptics, to a Chani with agency, to evil Jessica.)

All these things added a lot to the story, IMO, and allowed it to translate to screen in a really beautiful way.

I don't think I'll ever be able to like the movie more (as I'm both a book person and I will always have a soft spot for Dune). But I think Villeneuve did a tremendous job.",Mutive,2024-03-29T16:20:06Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,20

If I had a complaint it's that the movies do Duke Leto a bit dirty, he was much more competent in the book and you can see very clearly why the Emperor feared him.",,2024-03-29T20:41:44Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,22
1bqmdwj_23,1bqmdwj,"Yeah I think this is the right thinking. I watched the movies with my partner and was filling her in on some of the characters motivations, key themes of the book, and they really didn’t come through in the movies. 

Things like Paul being locked into his destiny essentially from touching down on Arrakis, the potency of his predictive ability, why the Fremen followed him (not just religious hysteria, he was almost omniscient, not just getting weird visions) etc. 

I’m a little disappointed how the didn’t focus quite so much on the terraforming aspect of the book, which I really loved as well. I guess it’s not as exciting for the movies, but the lengths, sacrifices, and wins the Fremen had in slowly transforming Dune into their paradise was beautifully rendered in the book.

1bqmdwj_28,1bqmdwj,"Chani solves the cinematic problem of over-narration, something Lynch struggled with in the first adaptation. In order to rid unnecessary inner monologue which works well in books but can be tedious in film, she serves a dual purpose so the viewer understands the conflict of Paul’s position, decisions, etc. That it’s his conflict or Chani’s doesn’t ultimately matter for a piece of cinema.

This is just one reason why I find comparisons between the books and the films pointless. They are entirely different mediums and frankly, a “faithful” adaptation of Dune would never actually work (although the graphic novels come close), which is why, ultimately, the Lynch film failed, and the Villeneuve film succeeds — as Villeneuve was less interested in remaking the novel and more interested in a cinematic experience (both visual and sonic), that attempts (and succeeds imho) to get to the heart of Herbert’s world.",Mount_Tantiss,2024-03-29T15:23:56Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,28

They may have done this so that she has more of a character arc in the movies but her portrayal was disappointing for me.

Denis Villeneuve decided to make a few changes in service of Herbert's original vision. He did not know if there would be a chance to adapt Messiah so wanted to be sure the message came across in these movies. Chanis role in Dune 2 makes it absolutely clear that Paul is not a hero.

There are many changes from the book I do not like, I think they ruined Kynes and Jessicas characters by removing certain subplots for example.

Everything about is bad and I’m a *huge David Lynch fan* by the way. I’ve seen his *Dune* many, many times. I used to pretend it was good because I *wanted* it to be good: It was Lynch after all!

But it’s bad. The look is bad, the style, the pacing, the editing, the acting, the SFX, the costumes, the random characters, all of it. It’s a convoluted mess and the fact that everything is crammed in there just breaks the surface of its badness.

Lynch said he never read the book when he was approached, then six months later had a script. Well, it shows. The script is terrible. If you haven’t read the book there’s no way you’ll know what the hell is going on.

1984 was an incredible year for movies; particularly science fiction. So many innovative films; films that would create incredible franchises, films that broke technological and creative barriers. *Dune* is not one of them.",Mount_Tantiss,2024-03-30T11:12:10Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,37

There is an oblique reference to the Butlerian Jihad later in the film when the Emperor is talking to one of the guild navigators and mentions that there are still machines on the planet Ix, but I don't think it's referred to by name.

Dune is great because it focuses on the characters, lore and story. It’s simple and straightforward, for the most part, once you get past all the terminology Frank Herbert created for world-building purposes.

It’s Dune Messiah where Frank starts waxing philosophical about things that are beyond his expertise. He was very intelligent and well-read as a former journalist and speechwriter, but he never was a real political scientist, philosopher, sociologist, psychologist, linguist, historian or folklorist.

Anyway, Frank’s posturing reached its height in GEoD. To me that book is unreadable. I love what little world-building we get, but that novel exists mainly for Frank to espouse his views on various topics. “Horny Old Worm Yells at Sky” is what it should have been called.

ph712h_4,ph712h,"I finished Dune a few weeks ago. At first I read a chapter here and there. Then I read a few chapters at a time. Then I read roughly half to 3/4 over the course of a weekend. I just could not put it down.

I think there is a lot more nuance about women in the Dune universe that you left out from your post.

I have only read the first book so I do not know if this changes later, but my impression is that the Bene Geserit are the most powerful people in that universe and they are all women. Sure, there is an emperor, but he would be nothing without the Reverend Mother.

Jessica is order of magnitudes more powerful than any Fremen, and the Fremen are considered the strongest warriors in the universe and cannot be let loose in the universe because they could bring it to its knees.

Jessica being a concubine is explained in the book. She was a concubine for political reasons she explained. At the end of the book, she tells even tells Chani (who she does not even really care for) something along the lines of that even though Chani will not be Paul's legal wife, the princess will never be Paul's love.

In contrast to the Bene Geserit, the Fremen women have a more difficult life and a more archaic and rigid society. They are treated like property, but also serve functions.

Thus, I don't think you can make sweeping generalizations about the book being in a written time and how the characters are a product of that time period. In Dune, the women are amongst the most powerful (if not the most powerful) while some are treated as property. This is not unusual considering that human trafficking and slavery still existing today.",sobes20,2021-09-03T16:42:14Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,4

I find it interesting you bring up parts that are problematic and I kind of agree with the sentiment but disagree with the example. The position of women is a reflection of the feudal empire in space theme of the setting. The problematic part for me is the Baron being a depraved homosexual, with his homozexualoty being a part of how evil he is.

Dogma that his mothers' Church programmed into them. The way Paul and Jessica use the Fremen is a harsh lesson. Twisting the BG preprogrammed dogma to be who the Fremen want them to be. Literally portraying Paul as a kind of god to an extremely jingoistic oppressed class of people. It's a very cynical view but also realistic and historically informed. The book itself says one must have a feeling for the kind of myth they're in, move within it in self aware fashion and sardonically present themselves as people want to see them. It sounds like sociopathic manipulation to me. It's beyond the Christian 'be all things to all people', it feels like barely concealed exploitation. I always got the impression that Fremen beliefs were ultimately inconsequential to both Paul and Jessica. Just a means to an end. If I have to drink funky water to get my army and I acquire increased psychic powers then whatever! It's a win/win for me. The ends are simply the reacquisition of power.

So, you're saying a book should not portray any society except the one we want to live in?

You're not alone -- the vast majority of people on Reddit, for example, do apply these kinds of value judgements to books they read. (Movies too.) But it's downright Orwellian.

Yeah, as a female Dune fan, Herbert's views on gender and sexuality are, to put it lightly, not great, but what makes it onto the page just kinda comes across as being a product of its time.

Even if he is.... *sorta* condemned for it in the text. 

Herbert was, by all accounts, a pretty conservative guy in many ways (I honestly kinda wish I'd never looked up the clusterfuck that was his relationship with his gay son), even if the politics and environmentalism in his books was quite progressive.

I'd definitely recommend reading the next few books in the series. I understand that the last two books, *Heretics of Dune* and *Chapterhouse Dune,* are kinda controversial, but I'm definitely gonna give them a shot anyway.",Aggressive_Dog,2021-09-03T17:19:50Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,24

ph712h_31,ph712h,"Glad to hear you liked it! I started reading for the series for the first time this spring, and I'm on the 4th one now. I fell in love with the world and the characters and the ideas of the first one, and that's carried me this far, but as I think about the sequels, I think i can only in good conscience recommend Dune and Messiah. Those 2 form a complete arc and I think provide the best ending to the story of Paul and the others. Messiah is quite the different book, with little in the way of action and nothing in the way of adventure. It's more of a philosophical palace-intrigue thriller, which I liked. I loved Dune, and the end of Messiah moved me to the point where I was literally in tears.

After that highpoint, Children of Dune was a real letdown for me. I didn't care nearly as much for the two characters, and by the middle of the book, the plot seemed to have become a meander which, though the plot picked up at the end, it did not become clearer. Characters kind of just did things, with little in the way of motivation to make their actions make sense. Plots within plots within plots is fun, but when the motives and characterizations of the protagonists are within those plots, hidden even from the reader, it makes for a somewhat frustrating read.


After that, the fourth one started off refreshing -- I cared more about the characters here than most of what happened in children of dune, but as others have said, it's just as much a journal of philosophical musings as it is a novel. I'm about halfway through it, and I've more or less lost interest. The ideas and world are still neat, but it needs more of a plot to keep me excited and wanting to learn more. Things just kind of happen, and then characters spend a chapter talking sagely about what just happened, and then it repeats. 


I think the momentum of goodwill from the first two books is what carried me this far, but that can only sustain you for so long. Who knows though, I may be wrong.

I think the hesitancy to use Jihad is in part a western cultural hangup based on the last 20 years of conflict with Islamic extremists. But if you look at the way the word is used in Dune, the Jihad Paul starts is a religious struggle against his enemies and infidels (with or without his intention). I dont care if the adaptation uses crusade in place of Jihad, they are close enough in my mind to make no difference, but I do care about calling the use of the word a fault of the book.",Copper_Lontra,2021-09-03T18:03:30Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,35

Only women are allowed to be fish speakers by Leto II because women have a deeper appreciation for life and a deeper devotion for their religious leader (Dune 4).

It's not Islamic. It's Middle Eastern names on top of Native American religious symbolism. The word Jihad might be axed by a studio, but that isn't necessarily a condemnation of the work, just a recognition of the times we live in.

Women being in subservient roles is subjective as well.

Dune Messiah, on the other hand, was not. Instead of calling it a novel, I'll call it a treatise on god-kings. It's a philosophical work much more than it is a story. It's completely uninteresting. There is no story line to speak of, and the characters are not compelling.

Children of Dune is much better than Dune Messiah, to be sure, but it does not live up to the standard set by the first book. Sadly, the tendency still persists to wallow in pseudo-psychological examination of the character's status as a god and what it all means to the universe.

I just finished this book as well. The italicized thoughts were annoy as hell. I just started skipping over them. The pacing wasn't very good overall. He jumps around and summarizes then drags the reader through some really long pointless scenes. I could not get a handle on why some things were important and some far more interesting ones got a quick summary in past tense after a jarring time jump.

There are aspects of sci fi that make it inaccessible to general readers who aren't automatically bought in. Dune is one of the worst examples of this the way it throws so much terminology and unnecessary detail at the reader one after the other.

And the Victorian style of writing out a sentence rather than just saying things straight out. Which gets worse in the next book, be warned. Although the next book is told in a more normal fashion. I'm only 100 pages into Messiah, but so far he's covered almost no plot ground. Again with the long drawn out scenes that could be much much shorter without losing anything.

Yes, you must read Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. The later books are also great reads but imo aren't as good as the original trilogy. I haven't read the books written by his son or others although I am skeptical I will probably give them a chance.

I am skeptical about the film adaptation although I will see it in the theatre. It can't possibly be as bad as the David Lynch film (much as I love his other work) but there are some books that just have so much meat to them that they just don't translate well to film (I put LOTR in this group as well). The book is already a masterpiece, leave it alone!

BUT i like what i've seen for casting so far - Zendaya simply has be better than the horrible choice of lilly white (and god awful actress...well ok Blade Runner) Sean Young trying to play desert native Chani in Lynch's film. Same for Chalamet - he has real acting chops and although I liked Kyle McLaughlin in Blue Velvet, his was simply miscast as Paul. I won't watch any previews; I never do.

ph712h_81,ph712h,"I've read the six Frank Herbert Dune books and those written based on his notes ""Hunters of Dune"" and ""Sandworms of Dune"", 8 times. I've read the entire series of his son's books also, though only once as they really aren't very good. Obviously, I have some favoritism bias with these books as I really like them, I also have a fairly deep knowledge and understanding of the story. I reread them every so often, and every time I learn more nuance and depth than I had the capacity to notice before.

God Emperor is my favorite of all the books, it is disturbingly relevant to human cultural evolution, and to this day still ahead of it's time. So much so that all these decades later, humanity is just starting to come to terms with the moral of its story. I hope we get there sooner than later though, or we're truly not much longer for our own existence.

&#x200B;

As far as Frank Herbert's portrayal of both religious dynamics and women, he outpaced Heinlein by decades in terms of his examination of gender and religiosity. His writing about these are often misunderstood as an archaic prerogative, mainly due to people still being delusional about how culture actually operates. Most of the perspectives on such things in these books are relevant today in most of the world's population, it is only in the first world delusions of grandeur that we think we have surpassed such biases. There is a robustness of social commentary in the Dune series that it requires a significant self-examination to come to terms with. Human nature is not kind or gentle, humane is a misnomer, a hypocrisy of self-delusion that goes nearly species wide to this day. As is so deeply examined, especially in God Emperor, >!none of us can claim a lineage free from atrocity.!<

The 7th and 8th books are important to the series and the overall comprehension of where Frank Herbert was heading. >!He was on the dangers of AI before almost anyone else, and he wrote a most excellent approach to integrating AI in probably one of the most effective ways plausible.!< It is steeped in a narrative that can be challenging to parse consciously, it takes some pretty deep pondering to really appreciate the scope of what Frank Herbert was on about. Also, unfortunately Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson cannot hold a candle to Frank's writing style or depth of narrative or social comprehension. So these two books, while far better than the others Brian and Kevin wrote, are not as good as the 6 that Frank wrote. However, if you really want to participate in the world finally waking up to what these stories are about, you'll want to get all the way through the 8 books that are canon to Frank Herbert's Dune universe.

As a final note on my commentary, one of the better ways to comprehend Frank Herbert's works in the Dune series is to think of it as someone wrote a way through the Jungian nightmare of Western culture's self-fulfilling prophesies. He gave us a light at the end of the tunnel, a light that could fork us away from the race to the bottom and a rapturesque end of the species.",How_bout_now_again,2021-09-03T18:57:02Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,81

Definitely a good read in the terraforming science department and analyzing not just the physical consequences of such a drastic environmental change, but the socio economical and political consequences too.  As some other commenters have stated, Herbert constructed Dune and especially Children of Dune as a cautionary tale on the dangers of a cult-like following for a charismatic ruler. 

However, I stopped reading about 3/4 of the way through god emperor, as the sexism became waaaay too unbearable. While it is noticeable in the first few book, god emperor is where i drew the line.

The movie from the 80's in my opinion was very good.  Nowhere near as good as the book and has some problematic changes as movies most often do when based off a book.  But the costumes and set designs are superb.  The actors are great too.  I've never seen a sci-fi movie that does a better job making an alien world feel real.  I mean look at Thor's world in the marvel movies.  Those movies are very well done but Asgaard looks and feels totally contrived.  Flying transports that look like viking ships?  A teleportation device that uses a sword to activate it?   I don't have high expectations for the new Dune movie.

As for the sequels to Dune, they are not as good.  But still worth the read.  There are good parts and the world itself Herbert created is interesting.

ph712h_117,ph712h,"Frank Herbert has three interests: ecology, religion, and socio-political interactions. Not how all his characters are flawed in some way. Even Paul. This is something his son never grasped, which is why he is considered at best, a hack living off the corpse of father's legacy. In any case, not to derail things, Dune is one of those books the benefit from multiple reread. Each one tends to add a new dimension to the story, as you are drawn into each characters point of view and methodology by virtue of, ironically, future knowledge regarding the plot. The first 2-3 sequels are worth reading, though no where near as good and far more sprawling and uncontained. After that, you mileage may vary. Until you hit he's son's ""continuation"" of the story. Those, in my humble opinion, you should avoid like the plague. Also, fun fact - if you want to see some original *illustrated* conceptions of characters and places in the Dune universe, look for a copy of the book called ""The Eye"". It's amazing that more people don't know about that one. Also, the Dune Encyclopedia, while no longer cannon (thanks again Brian), is also worth tracking down if you can find it and enjoy the lore. It's contents were also endorsed by Herbert prior to his death and his son't travesty.

Also i think Hurbert studied a bit of history so he likely knew that not all spouses of the aristocracy were elevated to the same rank. We see that with the British monarchy where Prince Philip was never raised to King when Elizabeth II became Queen. He was called the queens consort. In Dune concubine is used in the same way. When we talk about ancient Chinese and Arab courts we sometimes use the words royal concubine or sometimes consort. The roles are pretty similar. Not the same but similar.

ph712h_142,ph712h,"I think it’s just dumbfounding that the argument you are even responding to is for some reason a talking point for a dystopian sci-fi movie or novel in the first place. First, it’s a dystopian universe. This is not an optimistic representation of where we are going. Second, the person commenting on it clearly did not read the entire series, let alone finish the first book. 

The Bene Gesserit literally manipulate houses ran by men for their own pursuits. The main character of Heretics of Dune was a woman that everyone was scared of. Alia was feared by everyone through 3 novels. Jessica literally set the course of the entire series, by pursuing her own free will by disobeying the sisterhood to have Paul. Chani had the most powerful man in the universe infatuated with her. Leto II had Hwi and the Fish Speakers (literally the most powerful army in the universe). 

You can argue about the presentation of the hierarchy in a dystopia, but when you read the content of the books in this series…women play integral and supreme roles in the power design and social orchestrations of the Dune universe. Herbert regularly worked with his wife on the series, and he was ahead of his time (possibly a time traveler) because of it. He wasn’t perfect…as his voting record and stray comments at times would suggest, but he was incredibly intelligent.

My hope is that people would really focus on the presentation of the information in these books, because they are truly unique and applicable to where we are today.

The women of Herbert's Dune are cunning, intelligent, and boarder on clairvoyant in their intuition.

Thus far they had only achieved it with women, remembering the maternal line. They are just trying to raise a man up to their level and gain access to the paternal line.

They miscalculated though, and Paul had recall of both male and female ancestral memory, which is what caused his prescience.

The question is, does the author use the social issues to make any point, or are they just there for the sake of pleasure/convenience/tradition?

Both Atwood and Heinlein wrote about subjugation of women... but not exactly in the same way. 

Herbert clearly falls into the former camp, not only does he show the segregation of women in larger society but he also shows us the avenues that women can explore in his world, and details how even that is fraught with oppression. Then he gives us a heroine who rebels against this system, and then he shows that she will rebel against her husband if she so desires. 

And then he shows us that this is the very reason he loves her so. They are a beautiful couple, and excellent role models for the man who will break down the walls.

Edit: oppression is a very strong theme in dune. The seas of Calidan, the desert of Arrakis, the domination of the Bene Gesserit, the subjugation of the Fremens...",Orngog,2021-09-03T18:10:23Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,215

The two finale books should probably be read just to finish the saga and I remember enjoying them far more than the prequels, though there is a connection to the Machine War trilogy so you may want to read those first.

Then you have the other books. A couple of prequels that deal with the founding of the great schools (the Mentats and the Bene Gesserit) and were totally forgettable, and what I can only describe as ""interqels,"" Paul of Dune and Winds of Dune that take place inbetween the events of the original trilogy and are completely unnecessary.

My favorite quote from Dune Messiah (serious tattoo material, if I can plan something out for it):

*The convoluted wording of legalisms grew up around the necessity to hide from ourselves the violence we intend toward each other. Between depriving a man of one hour from his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a difference of degree. You have done violence to him, consumed his energy. Elaborate euphemisms may conceal your intent to kill, but behind any use of power over another the ultimate assumption remains:*

hkztym_70,hkztym,"I was obsessed with the Frank Herbert books when I was younger- I spent more time than I care to admit trying to tease out all the underlying messages that the series is just so full of.  There's just so much to discuss and to unpack in what he's trying to say.  I strongly recommend you read through all 6 of the original books, as the choices that Paul and his children make have enormous consequences for the rest of the galaxy through thousands of years.  Man, SUCH a good series!  
I think people are split on all the books written by Frank Herbert's son, and that's fair.  For me, I have read a few but they just don't have the mystery and the allegory and the layers of the original books.  They are just kind of adventure stories.  In my own opinion that makes them not canon, but of course everyone has their own opinion.  


If you are interested in the universe, Quinns Ideas channel on Youtube has done a lot of good parsing of the stories.  I really like his interpretations.  Probably my favorite Sci Fi series of all time by far.

I don't know why one responder wrote that we don't have the last story because his son and Anderson had the notes Frank left that said what the end of the story was going to be. As for the movies, I'm apparently in the minority in thinking that the 1983 version is very good (except for a couple of details) given what they could film at the time.

The ~~British Empire~~ Atreides from an ~~Island~~ water world and the imperialistic ~~Russians~~ Harknonnen vie for control of the region.

Eventually, the charismatic [~~Lawrence of Arabia~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._E._Lawrence) Paul, from the ~~British Empire~~ Atreides manages to unite the squabbling ~~Arab~~ Fremen tribes, liberating ~~Damascus~~  Arrakeen and fending off both the incumbent ~~Ottomans~~ Imperials and the ~~Russians~~ Harkonnen.

I have also read the sequels/ prequels written by his son  and although they are less complex, they still add meat to the bones and emerge you in the the Dune universe; where it all started...and how it it ends.

It is a well-balanced mix of so many elements. Influences of it can still be found in franchises such as Star Wars and The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. Great read indeed. Definitely finish it.

The second one (Dune Messiah) I didn't really care for that much, but it does continue Paul's storyline and ties up some loose ends so I say you should read that as well. It is very short, anyway. 

The third one (Children of Dune) focuses on his two children, whom I found to be very likeable characters. This one is definitely the second-best out of all six. 

The fourth one (God Emperor) is where shit gets pretty bizarre, but I think it has some philosophical qualities that you might like. I guess this is really where it gets all up to taste.

The fith and sixth ones (Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune) I  personally didn't care for at allm although I guess these are also the ones you need to try for yourself.

The effect is no different to me than the Foundation series of which the original trilogy is the core, but many prequels and sequels were released (or shoe-horned in) over time with even some guest writers being invited. The Second Foundation trilogy by Greg Bear(***Foundation and Chaos***), Gregory Benford(***Foundation's Fear***) and David Brin(***Foundation's Triumph***) had the same effect on me.

In the years since I read GE, most people have pointed this out. House intrigue doesn't matter, Arrrakis is not the world they grew to love and there are no Fremen left.

hkztym_163,hkztym,"I agree with stopping caring about the characters into Heretics but for me that's because ultimately the Dune saga really ends with God-Emperor. Once you know Leto II managed to complete his vision to lead humanity towards the Golden Path, that's where Dune ends imho, the first book is more about Paul himself and his story, and with the following books you understand more how the first novel is also about Paul refusing the sacrifices he sees necessary for the Golden Path. The rest of the series is about how someone else takes those steps.  I found it very fascinating how everything ends in God-Emperor, but it's really only interesting if you considering it an ending, if you keep digging into the future with what happens next, even God-Emperor as a story kind of loses its meaning and strength.   

It is true though that even God-Emperor is not a book about characters anymore (I guess Leto II is an interesting one though, but whether you like him or not it's entirely personal, I tend to agree with the pretentiousness but that can be said about many other characters in the story, even some of the most beloved, it depends a bit how they ""hit"" you).  

God-Emperor to me is also even more interesting if you can see it back to back with the original Dune: the first book really insists a lot on how naive Paul is by seeing the future but trying to turn away from the carnage of the jihad (and beyond), and how he ultimately fails both in avoiding that and also in securing humanity's existence. God-Emperor shows embracing and committing to the horror for ""the greater good"", and while the idea itself is nothing original or amazing, I think it gains strength if you can really see the two sides of the coin, Paul and Leto II.",Golvellius,2020-07-04T15:49:05Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,163

hkztym_169,hkztym,"I don't specifically remember anything about Jews, but chapterhouse and heretics focused on the Bene Gesserit.

Basically, after God-Emperor, there was an explosion of space exploration (Leto's entire plan for humanity).  All of the sub groups: Thelaxau, Fish Speakers, Bene Gesserit, etc, all send people into space, but none of the explorers communicate back to the Known Worlds.    Hundreds of years later, the groups return and try to conquer the Known Worlds.   The leaders are the Honored Matres, which was a result of the inter mixing of the skill pool of each group.  

Heretics and Chapterhouse go into more detail about weaponizing politics, weaponizing sex, and how one can become immortal through cloning.  For example, the Honored Matres use sex to turn people into loyal fanatics who become literally addicted to sex (suffer withdrawals, need their fix, etc.)  Also, they have a  decentralized nervous system, like insects, so they can kick crazy fast with no conscious thought (mentioned way too much throughout the books)

I would not put Heretics and Chapterhouse in the same category as Dune.   There tension, drama, and action were not nearly as vibrant as in the first trilogy.  For me, they were a tedious slog to get through.  You wouldnt miss much from the Dune universe if they remain unread.",Abyss_of_Dreams,2020-07-04T13:00:31Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,169

I think Brain tried to make the later Dune books into more contemporary Sci-Fi, with space battles and the like.   That wasn't the core of Dune and didnt really fit.

Sure, there are sandworms in the same way Martin’s epic has dragons, but Dune remains a story about people and power.

For readers here who don't know, I'll tell you the truth: Frank Herbert's original *Dune* novels are a thinly veiled story about Islam and the Middle East.

It is dangerous to criticize Islam, or to portray powerful Muslims in a negative light, so Herbert said what he wanted to say about Islam and the Middle East by setting the story in the future in outer space. He made the Middle East into a planet, and the Earth in to the cosmos in which the story is set

Arrakis = Arabia
Spice = Oil
The Messiah that they are trying to create is the Caliph of Islam - which has now actually been created. Instead of Muslims trying to conquer the world, he has various tribal leaders - House Harkonnen etc trying to rule the universe.

Paul Atreides’ aristocratic father takes him to the planet Arrakis (known colloquially as Dune) under the pretense they will colonize it for the emperor. Arrakis is the only source of melange, a precious spice known to create mind-expanding and life-increasing possibilities—and nearly everyone in the empire is addicted to it.

* I don't think ""nearly everyone in the empire is addicted"" to melange, are they?  Wouldn't everyone have all-blue eyes?  Most people couldn't *afford* to be dependent on the spice, since a briefcase full of it can buy a planet.

No. Obviously there are allusions to such, but to reduce Dune down to this is not only wrong, it's silly. The origin of Dune came from Frank's observations of encroaching desert/sand near where he lived in the landscape. He wanted to deal with the messiah, the dangers of humans looking for one, for a leader, for a superhero, and the dangers of religion, of cult, of religious fever and war/Jihad, the spice served as a metaphor for oil of course, he wanted to deal with the idea of a planet being the focal point/powerhouse center of an entire galaxy etc. He explains all this in Heretics of Dune in the prologue, I suggest you read it.

3r80e0_62,3r80e0,">That's not why Shaddam IV sent the Atreides to Arrakis, is it?

I last read the book about a month ago, and to my recollection it's not really clear how Leto Atriedes came to give up Caladan and take Dune as his fief, other than that it was granted by the Emperor. It mentions the transfer being a ""fief complete,"" and that nominally at least it was a great victory. But references that Duke leto felt honor required it, but at the same time was fully aware it was a Harkonnen trap, so it seems it was likely the result of diplomatic machinations. 

>I don't think ""nearly everyone in the empire is addicted"" to melange, are they? Wouldn't everyone have all-blue eyes? Most people couldn't afford to be dependent on the spice, since a briefcase full of it can buy a planet.

I think only extremely heavy consumption of the spice gave the ""fremen"" blue in blue eyes, but the book is clear that the spice is physically addictive. It extends the life of the user, but once someone begins taking it, they cannot stop taking it or they risk death. Guildsmen use it for lightspeed travel.

>Paul and Jessica didn't ""stumble upon"" the Fremen; they sought them out: ""It was sea power and air power on Caladan ... here, it's desert power. The Fremen are the key.""

Depends on your interpretation maybe.   Paul and Jessica definitely ""stumbled"" onto Stilgar's particular band of Fremen, but by that time Paul had foreseen it in his spice driven prescience.   But the Atriedes men had definitely sought out the Fremen as an ally on Arrakis where the Harkonnen had hunted them, and Paul's evolution among the Fremen was a natural evolution of that.

3r80e0_63,3r80e0,"Why exactly the Atreides were set up on Dune isn't quite correct, he glosses over that Paul was not supposed to a boy and not supposed to have Bene Gesserit training, the Fremen don't really mold him into their savior - him and his mother use the prophecies planted by the Bene Gesserit to secure their own safety and security and Paul eventually follows through on it on his own, Dune isn't about resource exploitation without any care for the natural environment. The Fremen have had a plan to change the planet to a green one forever, along with the scientist looking after the planet (Keynes? can't remember his name). The Fremen were a product of their environment, and weren't placed there... 

Most critically, he says the spice isn't needed for survival, when it absolutely is. It's the only thing that makes their society possible, as the Navigators need tremendous amounts of spice to be able to navigate whatever it is they use to move their ships through space at FTL speeds. 

Dune is one of my favorite books of all time and I'm all about seeing features on it but this one was way, way off on the actual content of the book. The author shoulda re-read it before publishing, I think.

3r80e0_70,3r80e0,"The empire in Dune is a fusion of all the centers of power in our world. The Emperor and Landsraad represent political power. CHOAM and the Spacing Guild represent corporate power. The Bene Gesserit represent a fusion of science and religion. All of these factors reinforce each other. 

House Corrino controls 51% of the voting stock in CHOAM. The rest is divided amongst the other houses of the Landsraad. CHOAM has a monopoly on interstellar trade. This is why the great houses have exports; Giedi Prime's hydrocarbons, Ix's machines, Caladan's rice and whalefur. 

So the nobility is intimately tied to (and derives its power from) economic power. Their hostilities are controlled by the Spacing Guild's charges for carrying a war fleet. They are also controlled by the corporate bylaws of CHOAM, which obviously prevent corporate officers from damaging the company's profits through wars with other officers. 

The strict rules governing assassin's wars within the narrow framework imposed by CHOAM (and the Landsraad behind it) are called *kanly*. 

(By the by, House Atreides technically violated CHOAM law by allying itself with smugglers - the Fremen - and thereby threatening the Guild contract for spice exports. This is how Shaddam IV justified his attack.)

Interwoven with the noble houses are the sisters of the Bene Gesserit, who manipulate history and bloodlines toward their great and hidden purpose. They are tolerated for their extreme utility- although they are more than capable of defending themselves.

The CHOAM/Landsraad monopoly creates a monstrously huge negotiating bloc, which you need to deal with a monopoly on transport like that controlled by the Spacing Guild. The Guild is kept in check by the monopoly power of CHOAM, which in turn cannot afford to alienate the Guild. 

This interlocking network of power structures, which has kept the peace for millennia, is called the **faufreluche** system. It is rooted in the extinct language French, which once used the term ""fanfreluche"" as its fellow extinct language English used ""bells and whistles."" 

The forms of chivalry and nobility are draped over the reality of power - money. The combination of hard economic power with political power, encouraged by the scientific perfection of Bene Gesserit social manipulation, has created the greatest form of governance possible - until, of course, the Kwisatz Haderach should arrive.

Does not Saudi Arabia today very much resemble the planet Dune? Does not ISIS resemble it as well? If you know about Islam, you'll see that the whole series is designed to warn its readers of the danger of Islam.

In the real world, the conjunction of two accidents of geology and geography have resulted in Arab Muslim states becoming very rich and powerful, and this has lead to a revival of Islam and its totalitarian plan to conquer the world, which belongs to Allah And His Believers.

In the world of *Dune*, the Spice, the fuel which allows for space travel [just how in the real world, oil allows for Earth travel] makes the various Houses of the planet Dune [e.g. the Middle East] very rich and powerful. They then spread war and desolation all over the Universe.

Similarly, Islam spreads war and desolation all over the Earth - fueled by the riches brought by the oil of the Middle East.

The various Houses are stand-ins for Middle Eastern Muslim dynastic rulers  - Alwalites, Hashemites, the Saudis of Arabia, the Shia, the Shah in Iran etc.

Whereas Frank integrated these interwoven plots within plots into the narrative itself, I kept thinking the BH/KJS books were heavy-handed in pointing out each ""masterful move"".  
  
That being said, The Butlerian Jihad - and its sequel The Machine Crusade - really tells the story of the cymeks extraordinarily well. The reason behind the creation of and eventual hatred for Agamemnon, the original escape of the Zensunni Wanderers to the planet Arrakis (and their declaration of becoming Free Men), and how humanity created, became controlled by, and eventually overthrew the vastly superior technology of the time.  
  
Sisterhood of Dune was arguably my favorite prequel, though. It's heavily about the formation of that triad of Humans Performing As Machines that, in my opinion, truly drive the universe of Dune. CHOAM, The Landsraad, the Empire, all of that is established governmental bodies. The real movers of human history were the Bene Gesserit (in addition to their mastery of the physical human body), the scope existed thanks to the Navigators, and Mentats (my favorite thing in the whole universe) represent the mastery of the Human Mentality. I recall Sisterhood doing a fantastic job telling the story of the formation of all three of these power groups. It goes to great lengths detailing their motivations, the development of the coda by which they operate, and the leveraging for authority in a universe devastated by the Butlerian Jihad.

I will also say that I think Dune deserves to be judged (if you're comparing it to other sci-fi) as a series. 

1) Consider the date that this series was originally published: 1965. The first launch into space was in 1957. This is before we had even put a man on the moon. The imagination to create a vast universe of civilizations on different planets with the technology they hold is incredible.  The fact that it even includes faster than light technology is crazy.

2) The characters and storylines are interesting, but also dark and grounded and defy traditional hero story narratives where they need to.

3) The universe that is built is vast and complicated and beautiful and the fact that even 60 years later it can be made into a blockbuster movie without any change to the plot is an amazing achievement in itself.

See I really don't care about catharsis or pacing or the amount and placement of action.

Dune is the best book because I think it puts forward some of the best ideas about how people and societies do (or could) function, and what people's relationships are (or could be) to society, to leaders, and to the environment.

I think those are fantastic ideas, which are critically important right now as the world today struggles with its relation to leaders in a social media-immersed culture, and our relation to our environment as the first generation to not have more space and resources than we could possibly handle.

Those are fantastic themes treated very well in the book, and Dune is my favorite because of them.

I don't really care how well Dune works as measured by what a standard story should contain.  Those are measurements suited for entertainment, and while I do find Dune entertaining...the entertainment is not the main value I get from it.",Synaps4,2022-02-11T22:24:04Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,6

It's a version of a dystopia future that's kind of an amalgamation of numerous different dystopian ideas: corporate monopolies (CHOAM, Spacing Guild), religious fanaticism (Bene Gesserit, Fremen) the fall of democracy (Emperor, noble houses), medical experimentation (Bene Tleilax, Harkonens), and others.  On top of that, humans overcame a previous dystopia (machine jihad) only to succumb to these newer dystopias, basically implying that humans will always find a way to make themselves miserable. 

The series makes statements about economics, ecology, civil rights, sex, technology, religion, and politics.  It basically shows how all of these can be abused.",,2022-02-12T01:02:57Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,8

sqb6ri_10,sqb6ri,"To me Dune's fantasy is mostly about the human mind. The actual story, the heroes and villains, and the fantastic futuriness of it are just ways to get into the brain and start talking about it. There are constant allusions to special languages used to convey certain ideas, different schools of interpreting the world. The result is a series of conversations where people more or less inadvertently discuss philosophy through their futuristic languages, and the reader gets to read everything that every sentence causes the other person in the conversation to think.

What would normally be a massive battle in another fantasy book is a chess match of a conversation in Dune, where the things that are said and the way they are said are the most important thing. Lives turn on a dime with a choice of a bad word, or misused body language. There are lots of descriptions of massive cities, buildings so big a city could fit inside, 100 meter long sandworms, but none of the bigness actually matters, because all of the real action takes place at the most intimate level, and much of the description is about how a character said a thing and what it implied and what the other characters inferred and what role that sentence played in the chess game.

So it's not a big bad guns blazing kind of scifi/fantasy, it's much more thoughtful, more adult, where people at least attempt to solve problems with words. And what's so cool about that to me is that the language rules Herbert sets up really make it feel like the ""future of talking/language"", which I think is so cool. 

And it also subverts lots of the tropes like the hero's journey and paul's prescience etc. which I think really contributes to the mature tone. It's not some simple sword and sorcery novel where good always triumphs over evil. It's an evolving and complex political/imperial story where you should never be too sure you're on the right side of history.",leuno,2022-02-12T13:38:35Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,10

The themes and a lot of the ideas that you can find within Dune has inspired and influenced so much of popular culture such as Star Wars for example or Warhammer 40K. In a sense it being the first mover in the Sci-industry means it's a pioneer and that's why many people praise it so heavily. Me only having read Messiah and Dune, I still haven't read Children or God-Emperor, I can attest to the fact that Dune puts politics into perspective of the difficult decisions that Paul has to make throughout the series.

The books scale is simply near unmatched and the series is pretty faithful to the philosophy and by virtue of faithfulness also rightly ruthless to the story.

It sets up a great premise, I definitely recommend it. I think people who read it as a story miss quite a lot on it as commentary on how society works and how to get more complex mechanisms working. YA in general lacks that applicability or rather the recognition of that applicability and the schema’s it proposes in brutality to its readers. I think it’s a great underestimation as there are a lot of legitimate metrics for reunderstanding world as in this book.

sqb6ri_22,sqb6ri,"Lots of people in this thread saying “the world building was great but the plot/prose/characters/dialogue was weak”. 

The world-building is all of what Sci-fi is about. Dune is considered the greatest sci-fi novel of all time because of the strength of its world building. All that other stuff is nice to have, but ultimately irrelevant. 

The essence of Sci-fi is breaking a few core concepts of modern-day existence, usually through some form of technology, and applying those changes to the entirety of society. Then you write a story in that world.

 So when a novel is held up as a great sci-fi novel, what people are talking about is the world that is constructed and the way that that construction impacts its story, not the plot or whatever else. 

Comparisons to LotR are completely missing the point of Sci-fi as a genre. There are no explorations of how society is affected by immortal races or how magic users are spread through a society in LotR. 

 In Dune, swords are the main weapon in combat because shield technology blocks faster strikes and explodes when it interacts with a laser. In LotR, swords are the main weapon in combat because Tolkien thought it was cool. 

In fantasy, the world is there to service the plot; swords have to be important, because Aragorn’s authority is predicated on him carrying around a famous sword. In sci-fi it’s the other way around, the plot is there to service the world. Duncan Idaho is the Atredies sword master to emphasise that martial combat is particularly important in this universe, and explain how shields work.",WrestlingCheese,2022-02-12T11:42:00Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,22

sqb6ri_34,sqb6ri,"I finally read it for the first time a couple years ago. It had become this mountain to climb in my head the way it was built up. I even bought myself a super fancy edition from Folio Society to really make it all a treat.

Admittedly, for much of it I was expecting something.... more, but I think some of that was because of how tropish a lot of its motifs have become today. The whole space feudalism thing and intrigue in the setup felt  at times a bit like a galactic (TV) Game of Thrones, not helped by what I thought was the fairly one-dimensional Baron as villain.

But then as these different layers started to drape together something clicked. The bits of lore implied a believable and rich world history without hitting you over the head with exposition, like references to the Butlerian Jihad and abolition of artificial computing, and the convergence of ancient religions and cultures reflected in the etymology of terms used by characters. Some of this sets up narrative themes, others provide explanation for the ""world physics"" like lack of projectile weapons and limited space travel.

Then, although the superficial plot and action feels a little unremarkable today, I think it's really just a way for the reader to explore this tension of interests between politics, economics, social engineering, and ecology through the Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Landsraad and Emperor, CHOAM, the spacing guild, and Arrakis itself.

I guess some readers are turned off by the middle section, but this is where it really put its teeth into me, learning about Dune and the Fremen culture, the planetary ecology themes, what I thought was an incredibly effective description of Paul mastering his prescience, and how it sort of challenged different ways of knowing and the idea of agency. Paul's ability became a sort of Anti-Psychohistory.

I also found the conclusion a bit rushed. But overall I think it is great not necessarily as a sci fi adventure story, but in the way that it uses a personal journey to organically reveal a cross-section of the larger systems and events at play on a massive scale, which is also different from Foundation which had fascinating world building and ideas but relied so heavily on exposition and jumping between characters to... well... exposit.",jlambvo,2022-02-12T02:56:38Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,34

sqb6ri_38,sqb6ri,"Why are you comparing it to Lord of the Rings? is lord of the rings sci fi ? 

You need to say which SCI FI novel you think stands clearly above Dune. Please. That would be a good first step to establishing the concept that you actually do disagree it isn't the best sci fi novel and give a point of comparison. 

Dune was published in 1965. You seem to be viewing it through the post Star Wars view finder. In point of fact, you should be viewing it through the PRE star wars view finder. 

I really really loved how Dune clearly is a powerful anti religion message, as the Bene Geserit are literally said to spread their false religions ahead of themselves and use it to manipulate local populations 

AND

how it details a native resistance group repelling and counter-insurgency campaign against hostile foreign invaders, in space. Which isn't really done in enough fiction at all. 

But again. Recognize this was written BEFORE Star Wars came out, by a lot, so the whole ""space mystics"" thing was not stealing from Jedi, but actually inspiring them.  

and how many times have you seen Sand Worms? Like this is something that is making you think less of Dune, but should be making you think more of Dune.

sqb6ri_55,sqb6ri,"I like it because it makes me think about the bounds of human consciences. As a genius and initiative-empath I can relate to Paul on a deep level. Growing up in an emotional abusive environment I learned to feel the people around me and anticipate danger. While many people dismiss empaths I believe its a skill anyone could develop if they opened their hearts and minds to the possibilities. There's a quote in from the OC Bible, specifically Wanna's passage: ""Think you of the fact that a deaf person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us? What is there around us that we cannot--"" I think of my empathicness as a 6th sense but this quote makes me wonder how many other senses could humans have but by being ignorant or unbelieving are we missing out on the 7th, 8th, or 9th sense maybe more who knows. I see the supernatural abilities in Dune as a possible outcome of human evolution where we start focusing on the limits of our body/minds/spirit and surpass our self-limiting beliefs. I read Herbert based Lady Jessica on his wife who possessed prescient abilities and had paranormal experiences throughout life which indicts the quote above is likely also reference the psychic/spirit realm(s). Which leads me to my next thought how people often bucket themselves into these self-limiting categories. I look at religion, science, and spirituality as a interwoven description of human existence. I often see people place themselves in one category then dismiss the other two. I get frustrated since science could probably explain psychic abilities and I believe it will likely be some sort of quantum entanglement but I'm unaware of anyone doing the hard-science based research. Or what about the speed of love? When someone knows instantaneously when a loved one passes away, a bond so strong it can be felt over a distance. What if we could harness that speed to travel the universe?_x000D_

So when a book sparks your mind with deep and complex thoughts you tend to remember it.

I admire the boldness, though, he would go. His sci-Fi has no aliens and such and deals entirely with stuff humans would do to each other in the future.

sqb6ri_60,sqb6ri,"Personally, it is one of my favorite books. The world building is fun and grand. The way he just dumps you into this world with meandering world explanations is relieving in a genre that has too many books where the first chapters read like mansplaining encyclopedias. 

Also, I think the action is woven throughout the book. If you mean outright conflict with the main enemy, then you are correct, it is mainly at the end. However, there is this rhythm throughput the book of building tension in some area of conflict resulting in a bit of action and release of that tension. The relative amount and intensity of action is relative and can be influenced by what you read before it. For example, if you read Ender's Game before you would understandably feel Dune was a little slow. But if you had just finished Les Miserables, which was my sequence of reading, it feels like a fast paced action novel. 

Another reason I love it, it feels like a blend of sci-fi, fantasy, and historical fiction all jumbled together.",Publius_1788,2022-02-12T01:52:30Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,60

sqb6ri_62,sqb6ri,"Maybe because it feels real. 

What made a Song of Ice and Fire ( and early GOT seasons) great is that there was so much worldbuilding that it felt realistic. It felt lived in. You could go to Winterfell or King Landing or Dorn and it felt like a real place. You mentioned LOTR. A great and older bit. A Master piece by its own standards. Yet, what was Aragon Tax policy? GRRM asked that when crafting Game of Thrones.   


To Dune. You can go to Arrakis , ether the city or the freamen and it feels real. As for its story , what Herbert does is tell a story in such a believable setting that you cannot help but feel drawn in. Everything, the ecology, the politics, the economics, the culture feels as real as it gets. Plus, it shows a realistic portrayal of a messiah figure. One that loses control of the people who worship him. As Frank said ""Charismatic leaders should come with a label : Might be Hazardous for your health"".   


So, I enjoy it as just about every theme from ecology to theology to economics possible comes together to serve in telling the tale of Paul , with the exception of his downfall. That is covered in Dune Messiah.",Redgunnerguy,2022-02-12T03:27:48Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,62
sqb6ri_63,sqb6ri,"Dune, without a doubt, has its flaws. There have been other posts here about awkward perspective switches, overly expository dialogue, etc. The metaphors are not exactly subtle, and the ""science"" of the science fiction, short of the premise, is lacking (not a strike for me, but some people hold that element in high regard)

However, the rich ethos of the book hypnotizes me. The convictions held by the author are not only developed well, but are seamlessly woven into the plot. The characters are inspired because they are the backdrop against which the philosophy of dune is projected, and in doing so they become mold breakers of common tropes mentioned in this thread. Paul is not a white savior, he is the demagogue which this book is warning against. The Fremen are not noble savages, they are the indigenous custodians of a land rich in precious resource. 

These ideas of charismatic leaders, indigenous rights, the wealth disparity, using religion as a tool for control, wars over natural resources, are just as relevant today as they were at the time it was written, and the messages of the book ring just as true.

I think what sets it apart is that it's deep, and has a very well defined philosophy. It has theories of power (both personal and political) and self control, it has factions with very long arcs. It has characters that do not think in terms of lifetimes, but eons. There is a defined history to the universe, we are seeing a hinge point in a very long arc.

In my opinion, many if not most stories are very compact. Dune feels like there are conflicts and rivalries and rises to power we never see, only get occasional glimpses of. There is just so much to the world.

It also happens to be the influence on a lot of tropes, but seems to do it better and does not seem dated. You get the feeling that it influenced other works but that the others are unrefined by comparison, that they see the story and create a facsimile but are missing the depth.",yrogerg123,2022-02-12T04:06:34Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,67

A lot of that comes from the way Herbert draws on our world. One obvious example is water. The absence of water is something we can all understand. In the book this scarcity is heightened by magnitudes, but still somehow remains an understandable and acceptable struggle.

sqb6ri_74,sqb6ri,"Herbert wrote Dune as the tale of why one should be wary of charismatic leaders. Paul destroys the galaxy in the later novels; he knows he will, and is tormented by it. ""Great and terrible things"" and all that.

The misreading is that he's the hero; he's not. He's just Paul, taking advantage of a situation created for him. Gaining power because ""that's the world he is in"". Doing terrible things because he feels it is right, and knowing full well that they are, indeed, terrible.

I love the world of Dune, the characters, the story line, the mythology, the world building... but the technical writing (at least in the first book) is a slog and a half. I understand not liking that aspect of it, fully. And, further, given how long and protracted the entire tail is, I understand someone tuning out of it.

I'm not exactly faulting Herbert for the technical problems of the book, either. He had no editor - the subject matter was far, far too risque at the time, and no one wanted to touch it. I think he's actually a good writer; he's just someone who needs a trusted editor to let him shine.

Comparing it to LOTR isn't accurate unless you dislike both in my opinion. Still, both of them are foundational at this point and both of them are worth the read--if not to enjoy them, then to understand modern fantasy in reaction to them.",tommgaunt,2022-02-12T05:04:22Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,75
sqb6ri_76,sqb6ri,"I read Dune for the first time last year, and I was bewildered as to why people say it's the greatest sci-fi of all time.  It is certainly the granddaddy of all science fiction.  It's archetypal, and it was groundbreaking when it came out.  But since then?  There's just so much better science fiction now (my personal favorite is the Expanse).  The first Dune book, taken by itself, is a very predictable and by-the-numbers messiah tale with very little in the way of surprises.  And the constant onslaught of barely-explained foreign words and concepts and institutions that passes for world building is pretty much indecipherable without frequent trips to the book's glossary.

That said, I also read the second book, and I found it to be *much* more interesting than the first.  And as I'm sure you've probably heard by now, Dune: Messiah is pretty much necessary reading in order to truly understand the implications of everything that happened in the first book.  Herbert turns the whole messiah/savior trope on its head.

sqb6ri_81,sqb6ri,"I'm not sure I can pick a best Sci-Fi novel ever but dune is definitely ""at the top"" in my opinion. The reason is fairly simple: Sci Fi, as a genre, examines the human condition in the context of society. The technology is simply a tool to allow more interesting questions. In Dune, Herbert asks us: What happens in a universe where a single entity controls the most vital resource? Reflecting back to us the question posed by oil in our own world.

Dune is suffused with questions just as powerful and poignant. No other sci-fi asks so much and answers so little. It is up to you, the reader, to discover the answers.",rivenwyrm,2022-02-12T05:17:36Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,81
sqb6ri_82,sqb6ri,"One of the things that I particularly enjoyed about the entire series was the lack of the typical good guy beats up bad guy at the end and rides off into the sunset for a happily ever after. Usually a novel will trump up the penalty incurred for failure, but it is not common to see one that attributes a penalty to success. Usually when a hero wins, the situations and circumstances of themselves and others are made better by it, the rewards of such a success are normally what the hero was working towards. With Dune, success has a penalty, and a grevious one for the world and those in it within each novel (up to GEoD at the least). That I think is what the missing sense of catharsis for some is. It's not the climactic battle that is missing, it's the sense of the protagonist making thing subjectively 'better' in their sphere of influence. It's less of the heroes kill the dragon and get the dragon's treasures and more of heroes kill the dragon and it's mountain explodes taking out the entire village nearby who sent the heroes in the first place and the treasure was cursed. Narratives build by adding a sense of weight to the reader, and the post climax resolution is normally where that weight is then lifted off the reader with a sense of relief. Herbert's structure though just adds more weight with a slight sense of dread instead of relief.

One of the things I think a lot of people really do like about Dune, in comparison to other novels, is just how different in structure it was written. How much of that was intentional on Herbert's part and how much of that is readers nitpicking into details well beyond the author's intent is certainly up for speculative discussion. At the time it was published, there really wasn't anything else like it out there, and even since there haven't been a lot that took the themes and structure of the series and elevated it in the same way that fantasy authors have done with Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings had such massive depth in its detail, but not the kind of complexity of woven themes that Herbert managed to juggle. That kind of depth though is not as difficult for other authors to replicate (with varying degrees of success certainly). Seamlessly interweaving complex themes while at the same time developing a narrative that constructs and then deconstructs trope after trope is not something that many authors can even attempt nevertheless succeed at.

Still, it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea, and it certainly isn't perfect or free from legitimate criticism. I loved LoTR, and have read them all twice over. They are more 'fun' in a way, but I'm not subbed to a LoTR subreddit for a reason. There's not much there for me to discuss except what is plain on the page (and at that point it's just quoting the books, which I find dull). Dune though gets into my brainpan and burrows in, makes a home, lays eggs of thoughts and ideas and speculations and ruminations. I can dig into the minute details and come away with more than what was written, spend all day discussing it with others, debating points, arguing, learning, etc. Threads in the book lead to other things to learn and read and ponder that are well outside of it. I dig that about it. Thanks, Frank.",Raus-Pazazu,2022-02-12T05:28:12Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,82

sqb6ri_84,sqb6ri,"So I don't think Dune is the best sci-fi novel ever. I believe that honor belongs to Gene Wolfe's _Litany of the Long Sun_. But Dune's easily in the top five, and for me that is because it's thoughtful, slow-paced, and flips ""the hero's journey"" inside-out. Paul Atriedes is a true anti-hero, not in the MCU sense of a rugged loner who plays by his own rules but is ultimately good, but rather, Paul's actions may look heroic on the surface, but they actually keep pushing him down a path that ends in brutal galactic war, and the deaths of millions or billions, for what are at least partially selfish and cowardly motivations. IMO, Dune should leave one feeling a little sad and thoughtful. And while I deeply love a good action-filled adventure that despite it's dark moments ultimately leaves me feeling inspired and full of hope, there's a very special place in my heart for those rare books that leave me feeling something else.",edubkendo,2022-02-12T05:47:02Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,84
sqb6ri_85,sqb6ri,">The book is notorious for its extensive world building and political intrigue, which it certainly maintains, but I feel it lacks the catharsis that action and conflict bring until the very end, and even then everything seems to end very abruptly.

The book isn't about action. Herbert's view, which I agree with, is that war and violence are uninteresting. Everything interesting about every fight was set in motion with the words and the actions of the powers involved before any violence is actually committed.

A major theme of the entire Dune series is prophecy, which furthers this point even more. Paul can see the future, and he agonizes over how to get what we wants, the safety of himself and his mother (and later his wife), but he is terrified of the violence pursuing this path will unleash upon the galaxy.

I adore Dune because there are just so many layers of intrigue to pull apart. ""Wheels within wheels within wheels."" I re-read the series every 5 years or so, and every time I uncover a new facet of the machinations. If you're looking for high adventure, you're barking up the wrong tree with Dune, but if you want a book that makes you really think about the world and the power structures in it, Dune is a masterpiece.

It's also interesting in that it grounds itself through believable in universe politics, making it feel far more real than a lot of  its contemporaries (and I felt this way reading it in like 2014, can you imagine what it was like in 1965!).

That said, I struggled with the at times ""dry""(to my 14 year old taste) tone of voice of it was presented in, and my own expectations of what sci-fi stories were probably made it difficult to follow what was happening - I couldn't really engage with it at the time. ""Dense"" and ""grounded"" weren't things I were looking for.

I'm considerably older now, and have a more varied taste in books, and it might be time for me to give it another go. I've talked to a lot of friends who swear by Dune being a masterwork, and they've talked about loads of themes and references that totally flew over my head when I read it years ago.",,2022-02-12T07:54:37Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,102

Keeping to the original trilogy I was enthralled as a teenager by the imagery and the, sometimes medieval-like, fighting scenes which mixed in futuristic conflict situations in space with almost knights-in-shining-armor valor and honor.

Reading and re-reading over the years, especially Children of Dune became my favorite of the trilogy. Later on, I added God Emperor, Heretics and Chapterhouse which I found far more complex. I put down these books in frustration many times over the years but eventually grew to enjoy their complexity of world-building and people detail.

By that time I was sold on the Dune-iverse as a whole and went all-in with the prequel trilogy leading up to the Battle of Corrin. How to write SciFi without allowing technology to be overbearing is probably something I have had a hard time finding in other books.

By the time I got to the Hunters and Sandworms sequels, I was like a junkie just wanting more, more, MORE! And yes, I did also read all of the ""*\* of Dune*"" books like Paul, Winds, Sisterhood, Mentats, Navigators.

sqb6ri_112,sqb6ri,"Dune is a meditation on power; the dualities of good and evil, masculine and feminine, the faithful and the faithless; how any philosophy taken to its extreme can bring ruin, and how even those supposedly in power can be powerless in the face of natural social movements and the motions of human nature itself.

Example: the Bene Gesserit spend *thousands* of years scheming and plotting and crossing bloodlines to create their perfect omniscient mind: the Kwisatz Haderach. But the Bene Gesserit are all aggressively and pointedly *female,* they *fear* the male side of their own minds, and for reasons only they understand, the Kwisatz Haderach that they are trying to create must be a male.

At the crucial point where the key bloodlines are about to join and create the perfect genetic union, the Kwisatz Haderach arises prematurely! And then everything spins out of their control -- the poor witches never understood the wild nature of masculinity, and when their perfect masculine creation skips ahead of their plans, they have no way to control or understand it. They could push humanity up to the brink of the singularity, but right at the apex of their plans they're simply helpless.

I think one of the reasons Dune is popular right now is that it flies in the face of a lot of stuffy modern sensibilities about gender and race. It's a massive id-piece, a druggy fever dream of rival philosophies rooted in rival aspects of base human nature.

Because of this it's full of colorful people belonging to colorful factions, with a tangled web of competing interests and motivations.

The prose is thick and obtuse at times. The story leans a little too heavily on the magical properties of psychedelic drugs, as though the author was trying to tell us that we all really need to trip on DMT to reach our full mental potential. But for its flaws, Dune is a good and fun read.

sqb6ri_124,sqb6ri,"I personally do think it’s one of the best novels ever written, sci-fi or otherwise. 
I think an important point to consider is how we partake in story in the modern age. Whether it’s a novel, a film, or even a video game, most people are seeking entertainment. While entertaining your audience is a nice trick to gain their attention, I believe where most people go wrong with criticism of a story is that they adopt a lens that it’s primary function is to entertain, while I believe the hallmark of an excellent story is it’s insight. Dune is chock full of brilliant insight into the human condition. Herbert breezes over more complex insights in one sentence than some books have in their entirety. 
I’m an avid reader, as many here are. I do film analysis for my day job. I write and direct indie films. I have no shame in saying I have to reread sentences for comprehension’s sake with Herbert more than any other author. 

I think the ending feels rushed and ungratifying in the same way that people watched Blade Runner 2049 and were upset the replicant rebellion had no screen time; it wasn’t what the story was about. 
Large scale battle scenes weren’t necessary, especially since it was already established beforehand that it would be a slaughter as the Fremen numbers and capability had been severely underestimated by the Harkonnens. 
The ending is the checkmate scene. A boy went from a hole in the ground; his house utterly defeated; his father killed, to god emperor, cementing himself into a fate he despised. I don’t think catharsis is really the right emotion for the author to invoke in that moment.

sqb6ri_127,sqb6ri,"Dune is a good read even if you know nothing about the sci-fi genre, but it becomes very apparent once you learn more about early sci-fi that Dune doubles as this sort of meta-criticism of the genre.

Early sci-fi has a lot of problematic elements the same way we look back at Dune today and see some questionable content. Eugenics had decent popular support during sci-fi's infancy and it was portrayed very positively; the idea of having superior genetics still exists in sci-fi to this day (look at Star Wars; Disney even calls the mainline movies the Skywalker saga). 

Another common trope was the idea of a lone saviour, who was so intelligent and special that they were the only ones that could save humanity; while this is hardly exclusive to sci-fi, certain characteristics were staples in the genre, primarily with a focus on intelligence, as well as often being reclusive or shunned as strange due to said intelligence.

These concepts are present, but flipped on their head in Dune. The eugenics program organized by the Bene Gesserit to produce the Messiah? It's contingent on generations of incest, and some members of those genetic lines (cough cough the Baron Harkonnen) are far from genetically superior. The lone saviour, in this case Messiah, whom the rest of humanity simply lack the ability to understand? Not only can he not do anything to save humanity, but simply by existing, and not even needing to survive, great tragedies will unfold in his name. 

This is still only one layer of what makes Dune great, which as you have already mentioned also has convincingly convoluted worldbuilding, and what stands out particularly to me is the political intrigue, but even after reading the book so many times this was a fresh perspective I wouldn't have found if I hadn't looked into the genre itself.",PrisonerLeet,2022-02-12T12:47:52Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,127

The story unfolds without anyone in control of it, which makes it very different from most of the heroic stories in scifi, particularly up to that point (1965).

If you read Frank's other works, you won't have anything to be impressed about. He's honestly not a great author. But here, in Dune, this one book, we have an indictment against every version of humans seeking to have power over each other, and demonstrations of how, and why each of them is fundamentally evil, no matter how benign they may seem or act. 

In addition to that, we've also got a warning about how dependence on a resource causes your entire economy to become dependent on that resource, and how dangerous that is, while also showing how the fighting of different fractions over that resource leads to the people living where it's extracted from end up being abused by all parties. 

If those weren't enough, here's a story about human caused climate change, and how we have the power, even in small scales of change in the short term, to amass massive change, positive or negative, over generations. 

No the dialogue is often sloppy. The basic plot straight out of a soap opera written by a nerd who loves space. The characters are mostly two dimensional, with tons of one dimensional characters treated as pawns by the rest. But there's layers friend.

Dune is what I like to call a 'wiki story': a work which sounds amazing when summarized, but with comparatively weak execution. I'm not here to say the books are bad, not at all - they're pretty, good, all things considered. It's just that they're so conceptually fascinating that they *feel* like they ought to be amazing.

As is, they suffer from issues with pacing, structure, characterization and narrative voice. Herbert is trying to paint a complex picture, and to that end he chooses to make his writing layered and dense - important world details practically assault the reader.

There are problematic cascade effects to writing this way: firstly, it's confusing. So much information is thrown at you, with no consistent way to differentiate between what is and is not relevant to the immediate plot. So it's easy to forget which faction is doing what and why.

The more pernicious effect, to my mind, is how this style hampers character. Because Herbert switches between character perspectives so freely, frequently mixing objective information with subjective opinion, you can't tell which information is supposed to inform character, and which is just sheer utility.

Dune is a story about sociology - government, religion, politics - but it lacks a psychological window *into* the society it constructs. Most of the characters feel like they're observing the forces at play from the outside - dispassionate commentators on their own life.

Dune I enjoyed because it has great depth. It has earned its place in the literary world. It was a very entertaining read, but it took me quite a while to get to that point. Mostly I enjoyed it because it didn't have any of the issues that I find in most sci-fi, like too much high-brow prose, overuse of nomenclature, overexplanation of science, too much action, flat characters, little to read between the lines, and sometimes also sexist.

Dune contains a lot of different topics, but is pretty round in all of those, and the plot is eventful and executed very well.",iHeretic,2022-02-12T14:10:58Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,141

sqb6ri_144,sqb6ri,"If you want action, read Book 5 *Heretics of Dune*.  It’s actually my “favorite” in the series but of course I didn’t know that until I actually read through them all.  It also contains my favorite character in all of fiction, The Bashar Miles Teg.

I studied politics and philosophy in college so much of Dune is up my alley.  Frank did an amazing job of world-building as you note, but he also did it in a way that was believable.  He didn’t bog himself down in technology or specific descriptions that would fall prey to aging as much scifi does.  His is a story of cultures and societies more than science and technology.  His adoption of current cultures, languages, and themes and blasting them 20,000 years into the future all succeeds and blends together in a cohesive piece that brings more upon follow-up reads.

I don’t even know what my “favorite” science fiction novel is, that may be Neuromancer or The Forge of God, or something as a one off thriller, but Dune is my favorite series as a whole and it’s not close.

I think it’s important to point out that scifi is harder than fantasy in many ways in that there is always this core element tied to our current reality and scientific advancement.  Fantasy gets to make it all up (I really really don’t mean this disrespectfully).  While Tolkien is an absolute wizard (pun intended) for the things he did, I think there is something to be said for taking our real world and spinning it into logical fiction.  

In the end Herbert’s storytelling is epic, the treatment of his characters is second to none, and the depth is among the greatest storytellers I’ve ever encountered.

sqb6ri_146,sqb6ri,"Imo, it's too much about taste and what garners your attention. 

I really loved Dune precisely because of its ability to both grip me but also not spoon-feed me action and filler so that I'll stay engaged. There weren't too many moments of empty tension that didn't go anywhere. 

Also as a young person it's a pretty complex read which is exciting for kids who have been reading more readable fiction like YA or even more poetic fiction like LOTR but want something that doesn't talk down or censor the more scientific content. 

I wouldn't necessarily say it's my fav but it's certainly one of the best.

If it's one of the best, you can assume it's someone's idea of the best. So it's not a hard statement to make. 

When you have such a subjective medium it's kind of empty to say something is the best at anything...more a form of expression about how much people like it.

You can't have a competition because the medium isn't a series of check boxes. Things fluctuate, what is good and bad fluctuates, what you should and shouldnt do in writing and story fluctuates.

I loved the first two books and I thought it was really clever, especially for the time, to use the heroes journey to tell a story of...more or less...a villain. The trope had just been invented into words and he already subverts it.

I haven't read the rest because I got my fill out of the Paul arc of the first 2 books and felt closure. And the swap in writers felt like taking on another franchise so I never got around to it.",magvadis,2022-02-12T15:39:04Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,146

We've heard Baron Harkonnen speak about his plan. Then we see Leto himself realising how bad his situation is and doing everything to prepare for the incoming attack. We get a glimpse of Doctor Yu's motives as well. And then it just... happens.

You know these coin tricks when coin is supposed to be in one hand, but appears in the other hand? After you see enough of them, you start to expect the coin to appear in the other hand. And Dune goes through all the motions, but doesn't actually move the coin.

Also a very good balance between building a big picture (the Empire) and a small one (Arrakis and fremen).",_Weyland_,2022-02-12T15:40:38Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,147

The frustrations of the end, the plotline building up, characters coming and going out of the picture and serving the plot (not vice versa); Frank Herbert has focused on the plot and not the characters which I personally loved.

I think Paul is really well fleshed out character, the world building is first rate, and I feel like Frank Herbert treats the reader with a lot of Respect. He doesn't throw chunks of back story all at once but allows the reader to absorbe and make connections as the characters experience the world

With respect to Lord of the Rings, Herbert is sort of the anti-Tolkien (both are obviously masters of their crafts). Tolkien writes literal poetry, spent his life creating a language, and devoted pages to descriptions of food and other cultural details. Tolkien was deeply religious, and his work feels mythological.

By contrast, Herbert's Dune universe is firmly rooted in access to resources and power structures. Who controls the spice? Who controls interstellar travel? Who has the upper hand in a fight to the death, or at the dinner table? And this is the crux of sci-fi as a genre: how does an imagined resource affect humanity?

sqb6ri_157,sqb6ri,"Here’s a quote by Frank Herbert about the ending. You may find it helps you understand why he ended how he did and that this was intentional. 

From an interview with Frank Herbert by Willis E. McNelly (done while he was writing Dune Messiah):

Herbert: There was another thing there, in the pacing of the story: Very slow at the beginning. It’s a coital rhythm all the way through the story. […] Very slow pace, increasing all the way through, and when you get to the ending of it, I chopped it at a non breaking point, so that the person reading the story skids out of the story, trailing bits of it with him.
On this I know I was successful, because people come to me and say they want more […]

McNelly: I have said this to my classes that, in many ways as satisfying as Dune is, I find it unsatisfying because there are so many unanswered questions; you don’t tie up the loose ends […]

Herbert: The stories that are remembered are the ones that strike sparks from your mind, one way or another. It’s like a grinding wheel. They touch you and sparks fly. […]
Now, we all have stories that we go on with after we finish reading them. As children, we can remember playing Treasure Island… Or Tom Sawyer… any of these. We remember playing these. The story stayed with us…the characters and their conflicts, their joys, their play all stayed with us. […]
Now, I deliberately did this in Dune for that purpose. I want the person to go on and construct for himself all of these marvelous flights of fantasy and imagination. I want him to… you see, you haven’t had the Spacing Guild explained completely… just enough so that you know its existence. Now with lots of people, they’ve got to complete this. So they build it up in their own minds. […] The sparks have flown.",PrufrocksPeaches,2022-02-12T16:50:47Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,157

sqb6ri_160,sqb6ri,"Dune is a lot like Lord of the Rings in the sense that it set the standard for the genre and was massively influential. Personally, I find the deconstruction of the messiah protagonist archetype fascinating, as well as how Frank Herbert portrays prescience and fate.

It’s not to everyone’s taste though. The characters are quite inhuman and lack relatable characteristics, but that’s also the point. They are divorced from humanity, and Paul’s father being compassionate as well as competent is seen as highly unusual.

Although I think Dune is worth it just for Jessica; she is one of my favorite characters ever, but more than anything, she’s my favorite female character because Frank Herbert doesn’t write her as a man. It’s common nowadays to see writers think women ought to be written like men, and not with their own unique qualities. If a female character is supposed to be strong, 9/10 they’ll just make her good at fighting, and I can’t help but think that’s lazy.

Jessica is fiercely protective of her family and it shows in everything she does. She is a competent fighter, but it’s so unimportant to the plot that you could be forgiven for forgetting that. The fact that her role as a mother and a faithful partner is never divorced from her role as a political mastermind, and it makes her much more intriguing.",cats4life,2022-02-12T17:13:48Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,160

The plot is interesting, for the times it was written, its very original. the world building is great, fantastic. But what makes great the first 4 books are the thematics, that sometimes the books treat extensively, sometimes just by hinting at them in a vague way. this thematics are many and varied.
it speaks about how the environment and the ecology influence culture, religion, morality and the form of political system (in a way very similar to the theories of wittfogel or marvin harris). the death of old empires/systems and the born of new one (the corrin empire is a sort of byzantine/sassanid empire while the atreides is a sort of islamic caliphate). the power of religion, their rational and irrational parts, and how politics may use it. it speaks how ancient costumes change with new eras. than paul and is son leto are tragic characters like no one else in sci-fi. they have the power of foresee future, but that does not mean that we already know the plot (its not a ""ultimate-spoilers skill"") or that they could live happy forever, the opposite. they must substain a burden like none in history, give up to their morality, happines or personal ambitions for the good of humanity. paul tried it, but in the end fails and so he become blind (blindness not only ""fisical"" but also ""spiritual"" and this is a strong link with ancient literature) and ihe is like a new mohammed how become upset and desperated for his own new creations to the point of hating his own religion for its corruption, while  leto is ideal ruler, who is ruthless amoral an tirannical but in the name of a greater good, and he use religion as tool for his goals. 
finally, it speak about inner growth, revenge, love, rationality against irrationality, good or evil and the struggle of humanity and its limits. all of that, not as a boring and didactic treatise on philosophy, but as a series of compelling novels. that the greatness of dune.

I don't think *Dune* is the best scifi book of all time. I don't think I'm even remotely qualified to make that kind of judgement. However it's on my list of personal favorites.

I first read it as a child. Like, a proper child, I was maybe 8? I took it out of the library on a whim, and tore through it. Most of the politics and inter-personal dynamics went right over my head.

But every time I've come back to it as I've gotten older, I've gotten something different out of it. It's politics on a universal scale and all of the pettiness that comes with that. 

It's about belief and pasion. About emotion and rationality. And the balance between all of those.

Are there bettter written books out there? Sure. Are there more influencial books? Sure. But for some reason myself, and plenty of other people, keep coming back to *Dune*. It's people, it's worlds, it's stories. And I think that's what gives it it's staying power. Even if I do think it's still a bit niche among non-scifi fans.

sqb6ri_187,sqb6ri,"You sorta hit the nail on the head for me why I liked it. It crosses a lot of ground and is quite complex without ever becoming unwieldy or difficult to understand. I think that complexity lends itself well to the imagination. Our world is complex, so it stands to reason that all other worlds may be too.

It's a sci-fi novel set in space (well, on a planet somewhere in space) that cares little for the space travel aspect. Its about politics, religion, capitalism, oppression, tribalism, legacy, family. You name it. If you skimmed it it would seem to be a shallow good Vs bad story but it's so much more complex than that (as Paul alludes to throughout the book, he is trying to avoid a catastrophe being carried out by the Fremen in his name). You'd think Paul is the good guy, you kinda root for him towards the end, but in the end his actions cause more destruction than if he had lost. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. As someone else alluded to, he sort of ends up being a Hitler type character (although you need to read Messiah to reach this element of the story) and a Jesus type character rolled into one. I'm doing s terrible job of explaining the complexities but that's my point, it has so many layers that's its impressive it didn't become unreadable.

For the record I'm not a fan of Messiah or Children of Dune. Messiah I felt was a failed attempt to sort of try and resolve a story that **does** end very abruptly and Children of Dune is almost like a retelling of Dune with a slight tweak.",Adam_Smith_TWON,2022-02-12T11:11:18Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,187

Just this month I heard the audio book of 'Dune' and the amount of 'Paul said...', '...Gurney said','... Jessica said' was really bugging me.

sqb6ri_189,sqb6ri,"This is also my primary interest in it - I think the aesthetic and setting of Dune are incredibly rich. It combines all these disparate ideas in a way that, somehow, makes sense.

Actually, one of the book's weaknesses, I think, is that it frequently misplaces the reader's focus - it assumes we need to know all these complex world building details *yesterday,* and that only once we understand the world can we invest in the characters. It's fitting that Irulan directs the reader to focus on place right as the story starts.

But what I wanted from it the whole time was more emphasis on character motivation and psychology. For me, engagement with a setting is always proportional to my engagement with the people who live in it.

Fiction and folklore is pretty prescient in that regard.

Some cultures call it 'folding space', other 'warping space'. In hebrew it is 'the shortening of the way', or *kwisatz haderach*.

sqb6ri_198,sqb6ri,"Adding to that groundbreaking with a few points.  It took FH six years of research and writing to complete.  That was unheard of before.  Typical science fiction was quickly produced and a bit “Have Ray Gun, Will Travel” back he started it’s work. Apologies to Mr Clarke and Dr Asimov.  IIRC, Frank Herbert’s agent was aghast that he was taking so long.   
Of course this produced a world building of a depth and compl not seen before in the “SCI-FI“ genre.  

It was also modern in a way that was ground breaking.  He used words like “ecology “ or “ecosystem.”  This was a time when most Americans hardly heard those words or understood them.  “Ecologist? Wasn’t that some bearded hippie stuff that was against American business?”  Hippies also Did Drugs!  Remember back then, all mind altering drugs were bad! Bad bad bad.  Jazz cigarettes, Mary-Jane, smack, uppers, downers, and so on. Especially new were  psychedelics which, many were taught, made teenagers think they could fly and then jump off the roof.  Now here is book with a government ecologist and an economy (empire?) based on a mind altering drug.  

Thus Young Generation latched onto this, not just the usual suspects of genre readers.  If classic Science Fiction was Big Band music, this was Rock and Roll!  To carry the thick paperback of Dune was a signal to others of where you stood on things.  Having read the The Lord Of The Rings trilogy was also a way to show who you were. 

Other writers have examining the impact of Dune have done better than me.  There several articles that cover this.  My take comes from observations of my older sister’s friends and the world around me when I was a kid in the late 60s/early 70s.",Merky600,2022-02-12T08:56:37Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,198

It's because Dune did for science fiction what LotR did for fantasy: made it something people took seriously as a genre worthy of thoughtful critical analysis.

The first run of Dune was rejected for publishing repeatedly before Herbert got Chilton, as in *the people who print automotive repair manuals*, to print it, because they were the only people who were cool with investing in printing such a long-ass book in a genre that up till then was considered the stuff of pulp novels and cheap monthly rags.

Since then, Dune has gone on to become without question *the* genre-defining work of the modern sci-fi era, much as LotR defines the fantasy genre. Even people who deliberately ignore the influence of those two series cannot escape their foundational impact. The very act of countermanding the tropes established by either body of work is itself an editorial decision.

sqb6ri_248,sqb6ri,"That’s a tough one. I won’t spoil anything, but some major events happen in the first few books that kind of knock humanity down a few rungs. The 3rd and 4th book touch on the major themes of the 1st and 2nd but now do so from a devolved society.

Similar to Dune, religion plays a very major role in the story. Honestly by the fourth book I would argue I was fatigued of the story. I also felt like the fourth just conveniently kind of tied things up and it was the equivalent to a stand up comedian doing a call back from the first 5 minutes.

The kicker is, the first book was a masterpiece. I’m a father, middle aged and all that and I have a daughter. There is a “chapter” I guess you could call it; it physically moved me to tears. 

It takes a lot to do that to me. That was peak Hyperion, and it comes halfway through the first book. Quite frankly there was no way to improve upon that emotional connection, that investment in the characters. The rest of the series could have been the long lost works of Tolkien from that point and I would still point to that “chapter”.

Edit: I gotta say though, you have to commit and read all 4. You simply will be doing a disservice if you stop. The author evolves throughout the books and you may not think it’s as enjoyable, or you may end up thinking it’s for the best, but you still have to take the whole ride.",itWasForetold,2022-02-12T00:19:40Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,248

So House Corrino feels threatened by the Atriedes so they call up a third Great House, Harkonen, who have a beef with the Atriedes to plot some shenanigans. 

Other important groups are the Space Guild, the Mentats, and the Bene Gesserit, who all formed in response to developing human mental abilities to eclipse what computers used to be able to do because computers are banned.

7cfbad_25,7cfbad,"Remember, Dune is science fiction.  The premise behind SF is to create an alternative reality and describe human behavior under these conditions.  

Dune's alternative reality is a desert planet which is uninhabitable by humans.  But this planet is the sole source of a product, spice, which is indispensable to interstellar travel.  

Having established this reality, the author proceeds to describe the social structures that emerge...the conflict emerges when someone violates these norms with unforeseen consequences.

IMO, Dune was one of the great SF books, along with Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, and I am sure others that are not top of mind at the moment.",joneskl55,2017-11-13T02:12:39Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,25

7cfbad_28,7cfbad,"You are at the beginning of a tale that spans over 10000 years of fictional human history. IIRC Dune begins somewhere around year 10000 (easy to look up actual timelines online) so the rivalry between Atriedes and Harkkonen is long entrenched. The best part of Dune is how it exposes you to the story: you will learn what you need to know when you need to know It, and be left wanting to know more 

But you are in luck! The original Dune series is 3 books long, and there are dozens of novels that flesh out aspects of the Universe. The expanded books came out after the original author died, but most are at least co-writtten by his son (I seem to remember anyway).

I recommend The Butlerian Jihad, and the books on House Atriedes and House Harkkonen.",ChepstowRancor,2017-11-12T15:51:21Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,28

7cfbad_30,7cfbad,"
I'm gunna be entirely honest and say that I hated Dune. I bought the trilogy collection because I heard how brilliant it was and ended up being bored and disappointed. I read through the whole 1st book and more than halfway through the 2nd and hated it the whole way through, it was a struggle of a read. I rarely put books down even if I don't like them but I had to shelve Dune because I seriously couldn't stand it. Sacrilege! I know I've heard it before, but hear me out: 

-Paul, the main character is a brat, he's spoiled and full of himself making him utterly unlikeable. He becomes more and more unbearable as the books go on. 
-the ""spice"" magic makes little to no sense, (it's food, but it's in sand, but its addictive but it's not but it gives people powers but it doesn't?) as well as other latent abilities that characters have don't have much thought behind them. Even after reading the appendix in the back it was still incredibly unclear as to why these things work the way they do. 
-Generally nothing is explained well, every other sentences uses a made up word forcing the reader to jump back to the appendix constantly or be utterly lost.
-the story in generally about a white male savior in a desert world that feels far too much like the Middle East. I.e. It feels inherently racist. 
-there are so many characters that are so similar that you forget who they are constantly
-the omnipotent perspective given to the reader is interesting, and I thought it was a cool choice at first. But immediately hated it because at the beginning of each book the author tells you how the book is going to end. This doesn't make me personally want to continue reading it, it just inevitably makes the whole rest of the story boring filler.

In my opinion if you don't like it now, don't waste your time.  Cult Classics, have the word ""cult"" in them for a reason, don't drink the Kool-Aid. Pick up something else and shelve Dune, in my personal opinion it's a really poorly written book. ",Yuerky,2017-11-12T17:04:24Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,30

Dune isn't necessarily the best place to go to get into that stuff, since Herbert really packs a lot into it at once. It's like trying to get used to spicy food by eating ghost peppers straight away. 

Not that you *can't* do exactly that, of course, if you really *want* to. 

If you want an easier job of decoding things like that, maybe try William Gibson's early short fiction; he throws a lot of unexplained references at you, but you don't have to hold them as long before finding resolution. Burning Chrome is a good collection, and also the name of one of the stories.

As for the stuff I didn't like; Duke Leto, the Harkonnens, great names and then the main character is called... Paul, all the catholic stuff (not hating, just kinda defies the galaxy far, far away vibe - took me so far away from the universe), I felt like the book took way too long to set up and then when the Harkonnens finally betray the Atreides there was just this lull in which very little happened which the book didn't recover from.

Arrakis is the most important planet in the universe because it is the sole source of the spice melange.  Without spice, the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, the spacing guild and many others would lose their powers and influence.  

Also, watch the opening scene in the 1984 Dune movie.  It’s very helpful.  ",wally3791,2017-11-12T17:20:12Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,81

7cfbad_83,7cfbad,"I'm going to go against the grain, and not be so nice.

If you are confused reading Dune, your reading comprehension skills are probably very low.

I started it a few months ago, and I was completely absorbed.  Although I knew I didn't understand everything that was going on, I understood that I shouldn't know those things at that point of the book.

For the odd vocabulary, most of it is easily understandable through context.

So, either you for some reason feel you need to understand what is going to happen from the very beginning, or you lack any ability to understand context clues.

If either of those is true, you should stick to easier reading.  Dune absolutely isn't a hard book to read.  If you think it is, you need to improve your reading skills.",PM_YOUR_BOOBS_PLS_,2017-11-12T15:56:23Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,83

7cfbad_101,7cfbad,"**spoilers below**

Jesus Christ, lol. I mean, I'm trying not to offend you here or anything, but did you really actually read this book or did you pay half attention?

Nothing about Paul is bratish or spoiled. I don't even know where you get that from. He comes from a noble house, the likes of which **own planets** and has tremendous responsibility placed on himself. His family is then killed and he goes through Hell and back through the rest of the book. 

The spice makes perfect sense. Hell, he even goes so far as to explain the life cycle of the creatures that create it. It's a spice. It's not a food. It's put into foods, like flour or cinnamon, sprinkled over dishes, incorporated in them, baked into bread etc. It extends life in everyone, and in certain people, allows for the ability of prescience, which is how the guild navigators are able to operate ships moving at speeds past light speed, and how Paul is able to see time differently than humans. It's very obviously explained. 

>the story in generally about a white male savior in a desert world that feels far too much like the Middle East. I.e. It feels inherently racist.

Paul isn't exactly a savior, and this is one thing I think people like you all miss about Dune. Paul uses the Freman. He isn't saving them from anything. The Freman don't need saving. They are badasses and quite capable on their own of destroying the Emperor's Saradukar troops, the most feared fighters in all the known galaxy. Paul is blown away when he sees their abilities, and knows he can use them to get revenge on the Harkonnen. After, when they unleash their holy Jihad on the universe, he has regret for what he's done. Nothing about this is him ""saving"" the poor sand people. They are the most fierce, capable motherfuckers in the entire Dune universe. He **uses** them, and his regret is what causes him to walk into the desert. 

Just because you can't keep track of all the characters, doesn't mean no one else can. It's an entire world you're inhabiting, and the amount of people is because this is a space opera. That's what you get. It's vital to the workings of the world he created, and I have no idea how you think he's telling you how the books going to end by reading the beginning of the book...

It's literally FULL. There is everything, from epic narrative to deception. From fantasy to sci-fi.

Having read a LOT of other sci fi ( like all Asimov works, Leguin, Clarke etc..) I find it very unique yet the idea fully resonate with Asimov. Its like Asimov asked himself what happens if Rome was a planet in the galaxy?  
While Herbert asked himself, what if the middle ages repeated itself in the galaxy?

Keep going, it will be a bit slower and different in book 2, but book 3 will catch up and be more similar to the first.

auldnh_16,auldnh,"Its one of those series where you have to want to read it all, you have to want the next piece of information, in order to absorb it adequately. Dune is like a slightly more modern version of the work of Tolkien in some respects. It has enormous complexity, and exposition gets dropped like a few thousand bags of cured concrete off a cliff edge, but it has to in order for the reader to understand the import of the events unfolding, so you never feel, by the end of it, that there was any fat to really trim from it, despite its depth and complexity. Its one of the reasons that I was so impressed that anyone managed to make a movie out of it, leave alone a television series.

First, I think most people read it in their teen years so it holds a special place in their memory and that's why so many people love it. I read it for the first time at 26 and I just thought the writing was terrible. I don't think Herbert is very good at putting words together in a way that flows well. Second, all of the made-up names for things in the Dune universe sounded so silly and just looked like alphabet soup. ""Kwisatz haderach""? Did he just pull that out of a fucking Scrabble bag? Same goes for the names of a number of the main characters, they just rubbed me the wrong way every time I read them (which admittedly is a pretty subjective gripe, but there you have it). I also couldn't stand Paul as the protagonist. Again, he rubbed me the wrong way for some reason. It's been a few years since I've read the book so I can't recall many details, just that I was completely underwhelmed by a book that so many people tout as being one of the sci-fi/fantasy greats. I did think the book dealt with some interesting themes and plot lines, but Herbert is such a poor writer that he totally blew an otherwise good idea. I almost want to read it again just to see if I was delusional the first time because as you can see in this sub almost everyone loves it, but I don't know if I want to try to grind through a long book like that again on the off chance I like it the second time around.

Look, it's not that the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson books are bad. ""Bad"" would be a terrific upgrade for them. They aspire to be merely ""bad."" The writing is so, so terrible it makes you want to gouge out your own eyeballs. It is so bad it manages to retroactively tarnish the original novels, and, indeed, all other written works. Even this very comment is diminished by their existence. If the co-authors were to die horribly--and please understand that I am *not* advocating their violent demise, no matter how much they might deserve it--the average novel-writing ability of the human race would noticeably and considerably increase. The bell curve has two ends. Unfortunately, for every Frank Herbert there is a Brian Herbert.

It's not that there aren't good or interesting ideas in there. It's just that all of those ideas came from Frank Herbert's notebooks, and their execution by his son is so lacking that the Herbert/Anderson novels are best experienced via their plot summaries on Wikipedia.

auldnh_82,auldnh,"As a lifelong Dune fanatic, my opinion is that there are only six Dune novels (those by Frank Herbert) which tell the greatest story of all time! These are all that is cannon!

Then, there’s a bunch of cheesy fan-fiction written by a couple amateur hacks attempting to flesh out some of the less developed parts of Franks saga, including the cliffhanger ending of Chapterhouse that we’ll unfortunately never learn because Frank was taken from us too early!

Don’t be deceived by Brian and Kevin claiming they have Franks notes! Their attempt at finishing his story is so bland and unimaginative that I cannot believe Frank would have written it. On top of that, they’ve never released these supposed notes. Compare this to Christopher Tolkien, who compiled and indexed all of his fathers notes and plans for middle earth and published them along with the Silmarillion and his other, newer titles.

If you still want to read Brian and Kevin’s books, go for it. As fan fiction they’re not terrible, but they claim to be canonical while directly contradicting Franks original work, and that is unforgivable to me! 

Anyway, rant over! Congrats on discovering this amazing series! It’s been a huge part of my life, so I’m always happy to hear of others finding and enjoying it!",JoeC502,2019-02-25T23:39:58Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,82
auldnh_83,auldnh,"Dune, the first book, is completely self contained. The next two books, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune are an expansion on the ideas and themes first seen in Dune. Children of Dune does have a somewhat satisfying conclusion so it is a fine place to end the story. The fourth book, God Emperor of Dune, is a sort of culmination of the first 3 books. It also tends to be very polarizing as most people who have read it see it as either the best Dune book or the worst. I see it as the best place to end the story as the following dune books cover a completely different group of people, themes, and ideas. 

As a side note, the Dune books written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are not on the same level as the original Dune books. They are more like fun space operas set in the dune universe, if you are into that sort of thing.",NomadStar,2019-02-27T04:27:43Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,83

auldnh_93,auldnh,"> If nothing else, the sequels offer a conclusion to a truly impressive feat in literary world-building.

But...the sequels end on a cliff-hanger. I started Dune back in '03 and completely devoured the first trilogy. I was in high school at the time and just loved everything about them. Messiah quickly became my favorite one. 

&#x200B;

However it took me almost 15 years to get through God Emperor and move on to Heretics. The one I most struggled with being God Emperor...I must've put it down and picked it back up AT LEAST 5-6 times. Having to start from the beginning again due to the amount of time that had passed since the prior reading.

&#x200B;

Once the God Emperor hurdle had been surpassed, Heretics took me a few months, more than anything due to personal reasons (work, school, etc.) but once this was over it was back to good old-fashioned intrigue and violence. Heretics and Chapterhouse were sort of a new Dune Universe built on the ashes of the old one (IMHO). And BECAUSE it ALL ends on a cliff-hanger and I HATE leaving things half done, I went out and got Hunters and Sandworms (both written by son and collaborator).

bvjr36_14,bvjr36,"I just scanned through the thread and didn't see this posted so I'll throw it out there. I also dug a bit for sources but I'm hungover and on my phone so I'm not going full research mode. 

From what I've read about Herbert and the Dune series is that he had an initial arc in mind that starts with 1 and ends with 4, but written as a trilogy. Books 2 and 3 were supposed to be just book 2, but after the success of Dune he was encouraged to break them up. Book 4 was the thematic endpoint of that initial cycle. 5 and 6 were to have an endpoint in 7. So all of that said: 1-4 can be read as a trilogy/cycle. 5&6 have some fun stuff but it ends with no resolution and gets into some weird old man sci-fi writer sex shit. 

As for the Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson books? I don't think it's disputed that notes of some kind existed. Brian even posted a pic of a floppy disc that had 'notes for Dune 7' on it. But honestly their books barely rate as c-level trash. The butlerian Jihad trilogy is downright unreadable for long stretches and while I can't say they are a cash in per se, they never come close to Frank's works. Hell the Dune Encyclopedia -though Herbert said is something like an alternate universe for his characters- is far more entertaining and makes more sense than most of the books B&K churned out. 

Understand: I'm not saying you are bad for liking them if you do. But they are a dozen books in, literally double the size of the initial series. It can't help but to suffer, to say nothing of the fact that these guys aren't on anyone's list of best authors. I don't think they diminished the legacy of the initial series or Herbert himself.

And with all of that is a sweeping epic that spans generations. 

The Expanse books are more action oriented. Yes, there is political intrigue and the same kind of mind-stretching twists. But it has a different feel.

A completely undetectable warship would have been the greatest military asset around and the most ruthless character in the series just never used it?

After that maybe take a break before the third book.",BigLorry,2020-05-11T03:16:44Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

You play as one of the different factions and every faction has its own strength and weaknesses. Often the weaknesses are actually blind spots. So you have to work with others to circumvent those weaknesses, and play your strengths up. There’s a lot of trading of information, alliances and backstabbing.

The third time - politics, intrigue, play of powers. Only on the fourth reading, and after the first re-read of Dune Messiah, its deconstruction of the hero archetype and hero's journey became clear to me.

At least Dune Messiah is pretty short so it doesn't drone on and it lays the groundwork for the rest of the books.  
Unpopular opinion: I loved his son's Machine series showing how the Dune universe came to be and thought he and Kevin Anderson made pretty tight books from his father's writing. I also thoroughly enjoyed the book they created to end the Dune series that was left hanging at the end of Frank's Chapterhouse Dune.

ghffxi_30,ghffxi,"If you think the first book was epic, you'll be blown by the rest his work. Granted he's not an easy read but you'll get used to Frank writing after a while, and even love it. 

I read all Frank Herbert Dune series, and most of the follow up series from his son Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson. Frank's original work is a masterpiece and sadly he couldn't complete the whole portrait before he died. The more you read, the deeper you'll get. The whole story is tied up in a way that you can be thrown back millenias and scramble to fetch one of the previous book to revalidate something.

Brian, wrote the two follow up book to the Chapterhouse : Dune book, and I must say, it is somewhat expected that you read the prequels before reading the Hunter's of Dune and Sandworms of Dune, as they tie up the whole scheme together. 

The prequels are not as good as the original work, though I did like them. Some books are better than others. The House series is set a couple of years before the event of Dune and expend a great deal on the first novel characters. The butlerian jihad era is more a bridge, explaining how thing have become the way they are and set the lore. And the latest Sisterhood of Dune, Navigator of Dune and Mentat of Dune are expension on post-jihad formation of these important structures. 

Also, Frank has written other books series that, altought not as complex as Dune are really good. The ConSentiency universe and the WorShip novels are great reads.",werfu,2020-05-11T15:38:09Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,30

Though the books that Brian and Kevin wrote get a lot of hate from the more hardcore fans and purists. I think that Pinky and the  Brain is a common reference to the two from the hardcore fans.

That is understandable since the two are not Frank Herbert and their style is not exactly the same as Frank's work.

I loved dune..:that is up until the ending. I was severely disappointed because Paul’s entire motive was NOT to become a tyrant. And that’s exactly what happened.

Fans love the first dune book, and that’s perfect, however everyone hates the final season of game of thrones...but it ended the same way? People truly despised how the writers ruined Dany and made her evil after her entire motive of the story was to be different (sounds familiar I hope) and everyone HATED the creative decisions the writers took. And I agree, I hated season 8 and it was sloppily done. However after completing GoT and the first dune book I quickly just felt like there was a double standard.

ghffxi_43,ghffxi,"I feel very conflicted on Dune. On the one hand, the world-building is truly incredible. The society that we see is deep, believable and Herbert's way or introducing us to it - through little morsels and references here and there - is really engaging IMO. And the main story that Herbert wants to tell - Paul's rise to a Messiah and Crusader/Jihadist and the struggle/drawbacks of his abilities - is really interesting.

That being said, some of the character work is really bleh.  He just doesn't flesh out some characters or make them interesting and then expects us to care when something happens to them. Like when Paul's firstborn is killed in a raid. We've never met the kid, he was only introduced in passing like the chapter before. It's hard to imagine how the reader could care. Or Chani. God. Chani must be the most bland love interest in literature. She just... exists. She's introduced and then like a chapter or two later has already had a kid with Paul. There's not much for the reader to like about her or much of their romance for the reader to hold on to which is a big problem when much of *Dune Messiah* centers around her potentially dying.

At times Dune tries to pitch itself as the grand political thriller. This isn't the story Herbert really wants to tell, but he spends a lot of time laying the groundwork for political intrigue, but then these things either don't matter at all or just work. There are a few chapters dedicated to Thufir Hawat, the former Atreides mentat who is working for the Harkonnens and plotting how to take them down... but then nothing ever comes of that. Gurney Halleck lives with the spice smugglers before running into Paul again and then... does nothing of much consequence after that.

And then the things that 'just work', the book does this really cool job of setting up the Emperor to be this distant, powerful person through the excerpts at the chapter beginnings and passing references. Paul has a plan to capture Arrakeen... and the Emperor just kind of walks right into it. Not only does Paul's plan to Arrakeen work exactly as expected, but the Emperor also inexplicably decides to come down to the planet surface - exposing himself for absolutely no reason.

I follow a particular youtuber who's a big Dune fan and a fantastic storyteller, and I've found it way more compelling to hear him TALK about Dune than I found it actually reading the books. I only read the first two, and I found that the second book really clarified a lot of things from book 1 that were never stated very clearly. I was able to appreciate things in book 1 from hearing people talk about Dune that weren't really stated in the text, and I think it's pretty poor writing to essentially say ""you don't get to appreciate these basic facts about this world until you read book 2."" Herbert clearly didn't want big exposition dumps where he TELLS you about his world, but he fundamentally fails to SHOW us things about the world either, so without extra-textual info of just HEARING stuff about Dune out in the real world, I would have been totally lost about stuff that I think are some of the most fascinating things about the world.",,2020-05-11T17:38:57Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,44

I live in a rural area. The other week a farmer was plowing his field on a calm day so there’s this huge dust cloud behind the tractor. I thought “oh! That must be what a spice harvester looks like. Better watch for worm.” And then I laughed at myself.

Subsequent books are harsher to Paul, but I don't want to spoil them to you. If you don't plan to read further books, search for ""dune deconstruction of hero"".

Some hints are already present in Dune: Paul seeing how his friends change into worshippers, Jessica creating an abomination, Jessica more and more afraid of Paul (""the monster they created""),  both Jessica and Paul cynically manipulating the Fremen through Missionaria Protectiva, brutality of Fremen troops under Paul's command, the vision of future slaughter. Paul's prescience and calculation make it even worse, because these are his conscious decisions as ""alternatives are even worse"".

Yes, it is all written so that it is really easy for a reader to accept all this, to rationalize it. After all, Paul was doing it all for the greater good, right? But this is a very similar mechanism that makes so many people venerate Stalin today, despite millions of victims, despite the Gulag, the Holodomor and the Great Purge. After all, he defeated Hitler and did it all to make the world a better place for the poor. Now, replace Stalin with Paul, Hitler with the Baron, and imperialistic society built on exploitation of the working class with the terrible future that Paul works to avoid - and you can get the picture.",skinnyraf,2020-05-28T05:17:56Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,89

Kevin J. Anderson's books aren't that amazing either, but I've enjoyed them.  Assemblers of Infinity was interesting, if a bit mindless.

1009x9o_14,1009x9o,"Well, first, let’s address that you think Frank Herbert wasn’t writing a white savior on purpose. He absolutely was. Dune and Dune Messiah are perhaps the most damning indictment of savior figures ever written, and Herbert was drawing heavily on real world colonialism when creating the relationship between the Empire, the Fremen, and especially Paul’s role as the chosen one. I can see the confusion, though, as it really comes to a head in Dune Messiah.

And as for Star Wars, yes and no. I’d argue that A New Hope is an homage to every type of story that George Lucas loved: sci-fi like Dune and Flash Gordon, Akira Kurosawa-style samurai epics, and above all, the hero’s journey. Both Dune and Star Wars draw heavily on the hero’s journey, so it’s debatable as to whether or not Lucas really “ripped off” what has been the most common format of writing a story for millennia.

And how much of what you named did Frank Herbert really invent? He was inspired by other books just as George Lucas was. Desert dwelling people have created irrigation systems for as long as there have been deserts, and Dune is so uninterested in actual space travel that it doesn’t bear comparing to Star Wars which prominently features space travel.

However, the best and only defense that Star Wars really needs is that it tries to do something fundamentally different from Dune. The similarities begin and end with the fact that they are stories that are very conscious of other stories.

Star Wars is a fun action adventure story about a farmboy becoming a hero, ideally meant to uplift kids with the idea that you can be more than your circumstances and make a difference (by buying Star Wars action figures, of course). Dune is a repudiation of this idea that any one person can change the world for the better, or that they should. Cults of personality are dangerous and toxic, and treating a man as anything more than a man is only going to result in blind fanaticism.

That being said, they’re also meant for very different kinds of people. We should teach kids that they can be heroes, and adults to scrutinize their leaders. Both stories have their place, so I don’t think you can really call one a ripoff when they do such different things.",cats4life,2023-01-01T15:16:55Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,14

1009x9o_16,1009x9o,"Dune is my favourite book for 25ish years, and I was a child when Star Wars came out - so very excited about the whole thing. Never really made much of a connection between the two. Especially if you read Dune’s sequels, you’ll get an appreciation for how much larger the story that Herbert tells is. Star Wars is space opera, but Dune is much more than that. Star Wars leans more heavily on mysticism with the Force, whereas Herbert’s take on religion is far more cynical - to him it’s a tool, and a useful one. The ‘magic powers’ you see in Dune are more akin to higher order mental and physical training of human capability than using the force to push rocks around or create lightning. Prescience is the only real magic in Dune, and even then it’s used more as a way to explore Herbert’s themes about human organisation than an explicit superpower.

Edit: other than that they both follow fairly standard story mechanics of the Hero’s Journey, and are both set in future space galactic empires, so yes there will be a lot of similarities, but they are more ‘plot adjacent’ than outright copies IMO.",briareus08,2023-01-01T09:50:38Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,16

The sheer masturbatory ""Star Wars is just Dune!"" meme on this site is hilarious. Nothing comes out of nowhere, ideas get passed down and altered bit by by in any culture.

To the OP: Dune was definitely a big inspiration for Lucas, and there are elements and aesthetics from Dune he pulled directly into Star Wars. “Ripped off” is an appropriate turn of phrase, in spite of the offense taken by the troglodytes in the comments here. “Spice”, “sand worm”, “dune sea”, along with some technology and character tropes were outright copied, not just taken as inspiration. Lucas has admitted as much in interviews. Asimov’s Foundation was another series he grabbed from liberally and also worth a read.

1009x9o_59,1009x9o,"At some point you're going to realize, Star Wars is an intentionally dumbed down, made to be as approachable, as vanilla as it gets hero of a thousand faces bildungs roman masquerading as ""sci fi"" as you're gonna get BY DESIGN. Besides the first layer, which is appearances, it's just world war 2 in space. The moment you suspend your disbelief it's full of holes, but that doesn't mean you can't love it. I love it. I still love it even though the latest trilogy was dogshit. But say, for example, in comparison to the Expanse series. More specifically, most sci-fi in space, if there is intergalactic travel, has to address the light speed limit and the logistical problems that represents. IE if you are able to go that fast, how do you solve the problem of a tiny pebble in space being able to punch a giant hole in your space ship. if you go that fast, relativity means you age slower. If you go that fast, and The Expanse addresses this, how does your body handle the Gs and not have your blood vessels just pop. Stories always find some goober drive, some flux capacitator, hyperspeed, foldspace etc to suspend your disbelief, and that's OK. But other things, like why would you ever build a 1 man spacecraft to fight in outer space? those questions are harder because there's just...no logic to it. Hell, we're using unmanned predator drones NOW, and have been in the last decade. But Lucas wanted WW2 dogfighting in space. That's the beauty of Star Wars. It's actually kind of admirable from a story writing perspective how it's basically VERY vanilla just set in this weird universe and he's somehow mixed in MAGIC and still pulled it off.

It's also a product of its time. Dune is too. Stuff like, ""can LSD expand your mind? If so, wouldn't everyone just take it to enhance themselves in the future?"" ""Is your memory stored in DNA? I mean, animals have instincts and shit, some people just act like their fathers or their grandfathers...can you access that shit?"" 
We NOW know more about how psychoactive drugs work, we know that memories arent in DNA but epigenetics means your fathers behavior altered his DNA in ways that made you more prone to act in certain ways and etc. But those were the cutting edge questions in Herbert's time and he extrapolated",hobbes4567,2023-01-01T21:22:45Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,59

And others point out that Lucas is quite open in naming his inspirations; off-hand I don't know if anyone know that Lucas even read Dune — if Lucas didn't read Dune and we know Star Wars predates its own adaptations, then it seems fair to say that Herbert and Lucas were merely pulling from the same sources when creating their stories.

2. Moisture farming exists on Earth, too. It's not Herbert's unique idea.

3. Sand worms? Tattooine has a sand worm? Ehhh. Sarlaccs are not referred to as worms, and they traditionally don't burrow through the sand, other than to burrow down into position to have prey fall into their mouths. That's a far cry from the worms in Dune, which are actually called worms. In the first Star Wars film we don't even see the whole thing... it's more of a mouth. Sure, the Sarlacc seen in The Mandelorian burrows underground much like worms in Dune, but that's a new interpretation not tied to George Lucas.

Obi-wan waives off a Stormtrooper and the Stormtrooper thinks it was his own idea. And even so, it's just a minor trick... sort of quick and dirty hypnotism that doesn't wear off.

The plot is convoluted so here's Wikipedia's summary:

>!A primary theme of Dune and its sequels is Frank Herbert's warning about society's tendencies to ""give over every decision-making capacity"" to a charismatic leader.[2] He said in 1979, ""The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.""[3] Paul rises to leadership through military strategy and political maneuvering, but his superhuman powers and ability to fit himself into pre-existing religious infrastructure allow him to force himself upon mankind as their messiah. As ""Muad'Dib"", Paul becomes the central figure of a new religion, and reluctantly unleashes a bloody jihad in his name across the universe. Paul struggles with the idea of potentially seizing divine control over his newly minted empire, but by following the path of his destiny he escapes from the burden of it. He lets an assassination plot against him play out, blinding him, and follows the Fremen tradition of the blind going out into the desert to die. The burden of the empire is then placed upon Paul's sister Alia, and his children Leto II and Ghanima.

rla55u_20,rla55u,"I've read first 3 Dune books. Really enjoyed them all, but in a conflicted way.

First Dune is beautiful in both story and world building, but it has this wierd tendency to spoil you the incoming events. ""Oh, this Arrakis reassignment sure looks like a trap"", ""Hah, the Atreides are walking straight into my trap"", ""Your father will lose this planet"", ""Damn, we're in a damn trap here"". And when the trap finally sprang, I felt confused. Am I supposed to be surprised that this happened? Why?

The second book felt like it was stripped of most world building and character development. What remained was the ever expanding schemes and counter-schemes, sprinkled with Herbert's attempts to describe Paul's prophetic powers without making them look either busted or useless.

The third book was better balanced, but the dialogues in it were so obscure that I often doubt if they were supposed to make any sense at all. Maybe the whole point of those exchanges was to display how one character felt afterwards? I don't know.",_Weyland_,2021-12-22T13:00:14Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,20

But in my opinion, there's ""descriptive prose"" and then there's Herbert. He's definitely great at painting a very very veeeeery detailed picture, but there are times when you'd just want him to get to the pain so the action feels a bit more fast-paced and as alert as it is presentend to be (minutely describing a fight over a whole page or more kinda takes the fun out of the action tbh). Personally, I couldn't go through with it even though I tried several times. Love everything else that's Dune related (movies, games, art etc), but I just can't handle his writing.

The characterization is horrible, which I consider to be critical to a story. If I don't care about the characters, there's really no appeal to a book for me.

The reason I dislike it being high profile is it's considered as the entry point for new readers to science fiction. I get the feeling that we're losing a lot of potential sci-fi readers by giving them basically a textbook with bad characterization, which gives them the impression that this is what science fiction is.

I recommend the Sun Eater series to see what an author who has the benefit of having Dune and all of the history of sci Fi to build on. It can get a bit flowery, but I would say it gets into prose and what a lot of people call specLit because don't want to associate with ""genre"" fiction. 

Another commenter mentioned the expanse, and I agree it has more grounded world building the scope they set out to make is still drastically different (we only really get 4ish governments and all but one of the originate in Sol system). Dune spans the whole galaxy and we have several house governments, an overthrow of the main empire, a theocratic empire rising out of the edge, and there are other worlds too. The scope is just very different. If you liked Dune I can't plug Sun Eater enough.

rla55u_52,rla55u,"I'm reading the fourth Dune book right now, very much enjoying the series. Regarding writing quality: Fear not, for there are many other fantastic writers in the sci-fi and fantasy genres and you'll not likely find yourself struggling to feed your imagination with fuel like that which you found in Frank Hebert's works. There are so many options and I'm sure others will recommend them to you but just to throw you a few options try Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn Series (complete) or the newer Stormlight Archive (significant body of work done, more in progress), or many other works of his. The imaginative plots are there and the writing quality may I boldly suggest is even better than Hebert's. Peter V. Brett's Demon Cycle is a brisk ride through 5+ lengthy novels that never slows in the least- very crisp yet and super enjoyable I would say.   Brent Weeks also has some completed series I enjoyed tremendously. Lastly- and here I hesitate- I must tell you about the book which I read before the others above, a story which singlehandedly turned me from one who dismissed fantasy/scifi to an obsessed fan. I'm conflicted though because the series is unfinished and I'm not sure if it ever will be finished. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss is so incredible the writing will pull you into his world like nothing I've ever experienced before or since. It is a standalone masterpiece written by an English professor- so well written I question if I ever will see a day when I look up from a book and think ""huh, this might be as finely crafted as Name of the Wind."" You don't so much read the book as participate in vivid 3D hallucination in ultra high definition, including your smell and hearing, and the character building will make your heart swell and then dash it into the sewers where it will muck around fighting for survival before finding a slight glimmer of light in the darkness and then- well, I guess you'll have to decide if you want to read it and be tortured waiting for the Doors of Stone with the rest of us, or do you want to play it safe. On the off chance you're ever seeing this, Patrick Rothfuss, please please please Sir. It doesn't have to be at the perfect high bar you set with the first, we just have to know where these threads go. Forget the ridiculous plot line detectives and peanut gallery analysts.

I read the original series starting at 15 (mid 1980s, right before ""Heretics of Dune "" was published). Being young, I'd never encountered anything like it. I was in awe of the perceived complexity and what I felt to be profound ideas written elegantly.

  


Fast forward to 2018. I decide to reread the novels after the movie buzz. While the complexity was still present, I couldn't get past the self-consciously wordy prose. Herbert didn't say something well in a few sentences when he could instead fill a page.

  


His characters, except perhaps the Baron, come off as a bit distant and flat. (I think that's why the characters in Lynch's ""Dune"" feel more tonaly in sync with the book than do those in the new film.

rla55u_65,rla55u,"""Dune"" by Frank Herbert is generally praised for its intricate world-building and visionary storytelling in the reading community. Herbert's writing is often lauded for its depth, blending political intrigue, ecological themes, and philosophical elements seamlessly. The novel's richly detailed universe, complete with complex characters and cultures, has earned it a reputation as a seminal work in science fiction. While some readers appreciate the complexity and thought-provoking nature of Herbert's prose, others find it challenging due to its extensive lore and terminology.

I’ve read LotR probably five or six times, and at no point would I describe him as a good fiction writer. He has his moments, but all his work in the LotR universe feels like someone demented writing a history book about a place that doesn’t exist. Character dialogue is, from a linguistic perspective, good — in other words, all the elements of what makes an idiolect are there, word choice, speech pattern, etc.; but as far as containing actual human emotion, there are…maybe five or six moments across the entire trilogy? that I find really moving, and they’re as much to do with his description of a scene as the actual characters. Does he necessarily miss on every point? No, as far as telling a story, relating events, he’s perfectly competent. But it feels like the story itself is what’s stirring and the writing, from a technical perspective, is just adequate at conveying that story. Tom Bombadil is obviously his worst offender (and I say that as someone who absolutely loves Tom and that section of the book), but most of Sam & Frodo’s trek to Mordor is just “they walked; it sucked; Gollum was there; after a lot of walking and suck, the ring wound up in the fire.” I think that *Dune* is definitely the worse of the two from a writing perspective, but I don’t think it’s necessarily unfair to compare it to LotR because Tolkien was…not great, as a writer.

rla55u_113,rla55u,"It is hard to explain. Let me try, but I can not promise the result will make more sense.

Dune uses a lot of shorthand and tells more than he shows. He tells you a character is sad, but then they never do anything with it. He builds up characters to be important, but then in the actual story they don't do very much. Two characters are supposed to be in grandiose love but there isn't a single scene with them alone - actually talking to each other. The only character we ever meet who was unbreakably conditioned by some future-science-magic to be unable to do a thing, does this thing immediately with the most flimsy excuse. 

Action is resolved by having 3 people in a room discussing their battle plans, contingencies and smack talking each other. And then the next chapter is again a couple of people in a room discussion how badly that battle went for them - but aha! there is a prisoner. And now they talk to the prisoner, etc. 

Paul sees the Future, that is not a spoiler.  And even though he only sees possible futures - so nothing is set in stone - over the course of the story he begins to predict everything and anyone but in the process he becomes less human. 

To the point where (Spoiler about 3/4 into the book, not even really plot relevant) >!his son dies in basically just an afterthought sentence and then never mentioned again. It takes the readers completely out in a WTF moment, but Paul is so out of there, completely in his own mind and futures, that he doesn't even mourn his own son. But the book doesn't mention that. It just kills a kid and then never mentions it ever again. Everything else you kind of have to build for yourself. !<

And by the end of the book and I honestly don't consider this a spoiler, Paul is basically all knowing. And when he walks into the final confrontation of the book, he has all the cards in hand and all the power. There really isn't a question anymore about what is going to happen. And since he sees thousands of possible futures, there is really nothing that can surprise him. At the same time, he is barely human at this point. And then - a guy shows up that was never mentioned in the book before and completely catches Paul off guard because he couldn't see him being here and this guy then decides to not do anything and let things just play out as they may. And small spoiler, that guy will never show up again. 

There are thousands of book reviews out there who - with any right - just ask honestly: WTF was that ending? Because for all purposes, it doesn't make sense. And its not explained well in the book. And a revelation like this comes at the entirely wrong point in the plot and then doesn't even do anything. 

But the implications! You could run in circles for days just meandering over the implications! If there is one person invisible to Pauls oracle sight, are there more? Are his visions wrong or can they be fooled? (Book 2 entirely wouldn't work without this revelation, because people find out that Paul can't see certain things and revolve an entire assassination plan around it. (A plot mind you, that is never fully explained to the reader.))  And what is wrong with Alia? That kid is described doing things even the almighty, future seeing Paul says he has no idea how she did it, and then its never explained. 

And all of that with an all seeing narrator jumping from character to character every chapter and revealing most peoples inner thought, there is always a layer between the reader and the scene stopping you from getting immersed in the moment. 

&#x200B;

But why is it all still worth it? Dune is the most extensive argument on Oracle sight I have ever seen. It starts with Paul and how overwhelmed he is by all these futures. And then this slowly but surely shackles him as he is trying to avoid one possible disaster running into another. Leading him eventually on a tightrope where a single deviation from the future he has already seen would lead to an even worse outcome. Add to that the secret of the reverend mothers and there are moments where paul doesn't even know if he is in a vision right now, or if he is actually having the conversation with someone. 

Alia on the other hand, born with future sight, is literally alien to everyone around her. And while Paul is good, she is a prodigy, which brings its own problems with it. But the books never really explain, only ever scratch the surface and have them acting in a way that seems weird. And with the narrator even never going deeper than any surface thoughts, and scenes never really exploring the characters deeper, and old timey tropes crashing in and Herberts complete inability to relay normal human romance in anything - it can feel more work than pleasure reading the books.",Daihatschi,2021-12-22T12:59:00Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,113

And he also did adapt it considerably from book to book. *Under Pressure* is much more sparse than *Dune*, less stilted and baroque, as befits a submarine action thriller. And many of his non-Dune stories feature a zany sense of humor that is almost entirely suppressed in his most famous series.

Bradbury has great short stories but his worlds often feel sterile and not as lived in.

The Dune sequels are good IMO but it seems to me everyone who reads them has a different opinion of each sequel. Personally I thought they were all great through God Emperor, but I had a really hard time getting through Heretics and haven't read Chapterhouse.

Based on your post I would keep reading, even if you don't like Messiah at the start. It's a lot smaller scope and more contained than Dune but it's a lot shorter and the second half is amazing.

p154r5_10,p154r5,"Ok, quick ""what about the rest of the series"" for dune. Gonna try to be spoiler free and reference other known franchises where possible.

Book 2: oft maligned by fans of the first book, a seeming shift in tonality reveals the first of many bigger lessons in the dune universe, and plays on themes from 1 that many people overlooked. Could easily have been rolled into book 3 as ""act 1"" imo. Imagine if there was a 4th OG star wars movie that started with Han being frozen in carbonite and ended with Jabba dying. Might feel a little odd on it's own, but works better when attached to more narrative. Book 2 has similar feels. Absolutely worth the read though.

Book 3 (Children): the pay off of the early books, and the ""at least read to here at minimum, if you like the series"" point that most Dune fans can agree on. This is also the last book before the crazy ramps up. (I say that as a fan, but I can't ignore that some of the premises from 4 out start to get a bit much for some people.) A nice wrapping up of the events of books 1-3, and a strong lead into book 4.

God Emperor, book 4: strap the fuck in, it's time for some heady sci fi. I've not seen sci fi do things like what's done in here, and as much as I love it, it's clearly not the kinda thing most franchises could do with any similar level of aplomb. Similar to how in book 1 you can relate to Paul with his move to a new planet full of strange names, strange customs, and strange people... In book 4 you get a similar experience with the vast swath of time, and unique insights into the main character's experiences.

Books 5 & 6: even the readers who like these can forgive someone for tapping out here. We go from crazy cool, to kinda bananas in these ones.

Anything after: it's basically fan fiction. His son took his notes and went wild. Some people like his stuff. Some don't. Most will happily make fun of it either way.

So tldr: book 2: get through it. book 3: enjoy it. Book 4: prepare yourself. Books 5&6: feel free to pull the emergency eject whenever",clamroll,2021-08-10T00:36:08Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,10

I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, have seen a lot of the the Western US since then, and for the last 10 years have just had this affinity, this love for the barrenness of deserts like you find in Arizona, Utah, California, Nevada. The imagery Herbert uses in Dune completely captures my imagination in a way that few other books have done for me; I know what the shield wall looks like, I can see the dunes, and the drum sand, I have felt the desert come alive at night as he describes, I can feel the heat and brutality of the sun during the day and the stark, bone-chilling coldness of night. I know how it feels when my body's moisture is spent, its only memory the crystalline salt on my skin, I know the joy of finding oases and replenishing myself. Many books have done a great job of world building in many different aspects, but I've never read another novel that so totally engrosses me in the immediate landscape, climate, and scenery in such an immediate, visceral way.

I read Dune a while ago so I may be fuzzy on the details, but it always seemed odd to me that Paul and Kynes envisioned an ecologically different future for Arrakis, one that is more palatable for humans but potentially disastrous for the planet's native flora and fauna. Paul is the so-called messiah and Dune is essentially his ""hero's journey,"" but aren't his actions environmentally more harmful than the Baron's? Although both are colonizers of Arrakis, the Baron is only looking to mine the planet's resources (admittedly in an unsustainable way) while Paul is actively trying to change the landscape and ecosystem of the planet. Maybe it's addressed in later books, but Paul's visions struck me as being very problematic.

Edit: I flipped through my copy of Dune and found the part where Paul and Kynes are discussing their united goal of turning Arrakis into a ""paradise"" and ""to make this planet a fit place for humans.""

Brian claims his sequels are based on notes Frank wrote, but none of those notes or drafts have ever been seen, the ending is completely different from what it seemed Frank was setting up, and essentially exist to milk the Dune franchise and sell copies of his “prequel” books.

That being said the original six Frank Herbert books are some of the best fiction I’ve ever read. Each in the series (aside from the fifth and sixth, which tie in to each other much more directly) are unique in the coolest ways and all are so so good. 

Many consider the second book to be their favorite, some are ride or die for the fourth (Herbert’s wife always said the fourth was her favorite.) although mine has always been the fifth.

Without spilling anything, the Dune series covers thousands of years of the Dune universe’s history and the impact the Atreides line has on it. I strongly recommend reading all six, although I will say you should read the second novel ASAP. The plots of the first two were conceived of together (parts of the second were written well before the first was finished) and it does a great deal to expand on and sometimes deconstruct concepts in the first.",zephyr_555,2021-08-09T18:27:46Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,65

Supposedly Herbert wanted GE to mark the transition between the first trilogy and a second trilogy. Unfortunately Herbert died before he finished the last book.

His son finished the trilogy (turning the book into 2) and wrote a bunch of sequels and prequels, but most Dune fans consider these basically fan fiction, and to be avoided. They're more akin to the Star Wars books and pulp scifi than to the originals

Then like two seasons of eight or ten episodes each for Children and God Emperor, and stop there. God Emperor is a good ending point; humanity becomes free from prescience and expands, I can even imagine the last shot, pulling away from the Old Imperium to encompass the Galaxy and beyond, as a voice over of Leto II tells us of the Golden Path to set humanity free from stagnation and of their expansion into the unknown.

Maybe if they tried something a bit different, and didn't try to break the books up into individual seasons, they could keep a steady pace. For starters, maybe something like the first 2/3 of Dune being season one, then finish Dune during season two (so give Dune about 15 to 16 hours worth of airtime). Start book two in season two, since it kind of picks up well if you did like a mid season cliff hanger for a few weeks after ending book one. Finish book two somewhere during season three. It would be tough, but maybe try to finish season three with the end of book two (possibly by making the episodes of season three shorter, or just have fewer episodes in that season). 

Book three would then be season four, then book four - season five. Or, if they find that they have enough viewers still, they could stretch books three and four into three seasons by again having the end of book three as a part of season five, then book four would finish it all up in season six. 

I think I agree on maybe leaving books five and six out of it, but more for the fact that they get more and more esoteric, then kinda weird. I don't see how mainstream audiences would keep watching episodes about those books.

Six seasons for four books - round it out to about 50 to 55 hours of content. that would be plenty of time to really get into it all, yet still hopefully be able to keep the interest of more than just the big fans.",DivideByO,2017-11-16T01:39:15Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,49

uq7t7p_5,uq7t7p,"I think you're looking at it through an incorrect frame. Paul isn't a ""spoiled brat"" at the start, he's the heir to a feudal holding that covers planets and has a significant position in both a) the mercantile/aristocratic alliance that keeps peace among the great powers and b) the violence-based monarchy (empire) that skims the cream off the top. He's...really good at that, and it's something that's continually reinforced about him. His mother's ""controlling""ness is because through her, he is the fruit of a millenia-long selective breeding experiment to produce someone who can actually see the future--and once that person arrives, it turns out that he is way, way more than the organization that created him bargained for. The opposition of those two personas, which Paul both inhabits, is the central driving theme of the first three (?) books.

As for the people saying (taking the top comment here) ""Dune characters are not supposed to be liked""--for real, do you not like Paul, and do you not sympathize with the terrible choices he struggles over? Do you not like Gurney Halleck? Do you not recognize the momentous choices that Jessica has made, even prior to the events of the book, and continues to make in order to save her son, and respect her for that? Do you not dig Paul's struggle between *survival*, which requires him to become the Duke Atreides in his father's footsteps, and the terrible weight of the Jihad he sees ahead?

Think of it like GRRM except way less lurid--Frank Herbert is writing some real-ass-politik in an awesome space-travel-psychadelic world. He's not just leaning on tropes, he's created very real characters and factions in his universe and is showing you the interactions between them.

Also it's incredibly dope in the actual unfolding of events. That helps. Read it as the same epic style that defines The Lord of the Rings. It's worth it.

How I would normally end this kind of thing is, ""if you don't like it, you don't like it."" But you said that you loved it. What did you love about it? Because my thought is that if you actually loved *the book*, you already have the answer to your questions, but when you come to critically analyze it you're asking them without taking any deeper look into your surface-level reactions to the character.

Are you supposed to like Paul? I think so. Did you really not? He's fucking great. Do you just not like him because he's continually smart and successful while maintaining a realistic understanding of the universe around him? Paul strays so close to ""Mary-Sue"" territory, but there is always the terrible weight of the Jihad and the *repercussions* of his actions, that anything he does ""too perfect"" is always accounted for. Honestly it's not even a ""wait for the next book"" thing. The next books really do expand upon it, but if you don't get a sense of suppressed dread from his ascension at the end of Dune, and come around posting about ""I've thought about it, and I really think he isn't thinking about things"", then go back to the book bud.

""Acts like a spoiled brat"" is a very common trope in a lot of stories. The sort of coming of age story where characters grow up....   but Paul?   With the tempered political knowledge and (magical levels of) self control? what? 

>Paul is kind of a self-important arsehole. 

I'm pretty sure the sisterhood also consider him kind of important as the culmination of decades of cultivated breeding and the first human (outside of the guild) with future sight.

uq7t7p_9,uq7t7p,">Am I supposed to like Paul?

I think that is the wrong question, and imho a terrible way too read books in general. It's a word that should be sought  in terms of actual people you interact with.
The thing you should seek towards Paul is understanding, or respect or lack thereoff and so on.

>Like at the start he's a spoiled brat

He's an Aristocrat. And to reduce the mum to ""controlling"" and Dad as absent is really reductionistic. HE is raised to be an Atraides. That means something more than just ""being spoiled"". He is somewhat sheltered and only confronted with  the upcoming reality in a theoretical manner.

>Again, kind of understandable due to him being solely capable of preventing the Jihad. It's all about him finding a way to prevent this Jihad, but during the book it doesn't seem like he's actually trying that hard haha. It's almost as if he's saying ""yes its important to prevent the Jihad but it's more important that I become Duke first"".

I think you REALLY missed the point of Pauls struggle or ability.
The core conflict isn't how to prevent it. It's at BEST how to prevent it without the consequences that will follow. Or better that preventing it is wrong because there is no preventing the consequences. It isn't particularly ""important to become Duke first"". It's all one thing, the thing that can't be avoided.

Overall I think you missed the thing that Dune is most known for, which is ""the big picture"". It isn't particularly about whether you (as you) think that Paul behaves like you would. Which is kind of the danger with just the first book, because it's written as a bridge from more ""captain spacebuzz"" golden age scifi and to basically bait and switch readers into getting at something more abstract/sincere than the space operas common at the time.",DaHolk,2022-05-16T05:10:20Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,9

I think you could make the case that Duke Leto is supposed to be admired. But that might be about it. Everyone else is a conniving, politicized, and incurable liar.

The entire point of Dune, or at least of the first three novel arc or so, is that *heroes are dangerous, if not evil*. Heroes destroy communities. Heroes break the societies that they seek to save.

uq7t7p_17,uq7t7p,"Paul isn't necessarily nice, no, and neither would I, were I in his shoes. 


It's this balancing act between first wanting vengeance and then wanting to prevent genocide in his name.


First he wants vengeance for the murder of his entire family not only by the Harkonnen, but also by the emperor, and ultimately by the guild. They are the true power house in the known universe after all — something Paul slowly figures out as he grows. The potential spice dominance of the Fremen is his key here. 
Second, as he grows up fulfilling this ambition, he also grows in his prescience and learns of the consequences of the religious preparations Bene Gesserit have done and of his actions so far. Read: he is perceived as a Messiah, and he is already so far into that path that it's costing him every second of his waking life to make the right choices to prevent the jihad. 


Meanwhile no one can ever understand what it is to be him, and he is constantly asked for explanations and justifications by what to him are toddlers who have no idea how to behave in their own best interests. 


So yeah, he's somewhat of a dick, but he also has to because he's trying to father billions of children who throw tantrums when he doesn't allow them to put their hands on the stove. 


In Dune Messiah way more of this becomes clear, and in Children of Dune and God Emperor of Dune the shortcomings of Paul become very much understandable.


And to those wondering: by the time Paul realises what's on the line and what his role in it is, he can't even kill himself, knowing the Fremen would take it as martyrdom, no matter how long his suicide note would be.

Jihad is necessary because of ""mixing of genes"" and ""racial memory.""   It's a massive pile of nonsense.  Paul doesn't make sense because none of the ideas do.

However, as successes are wont to do, success fuels desires for more success and four years later the second tome *""Dune Messiah""* hit the shelves. Then seven more years and *""Children of Dune""* appeared, five years on, 1981, and *""God Emperopr of Dune""*  hit the shelves. Then in '84 and '85  *""Heretics of Dune""* and *""Chapterhouse Dune""* came in. 


The six novel series was written and released over a 20 year period, but i saw that as the result of having woven such a rich original tapestry that the original work could support and justify carrying it forward, not as an originally planned multi sequel endeavor.

Just because it isn't for you, doesn't make it overrated. It's rated that highly because it does something that is rarely done well, and was paradigm-shifting in Science fiction at the time.
The mere fact that you can't appreciate it and escape into it because it deals with themes that you don't care about is not relevant to that.

iwz6ol_6,iwz6ol,"It's funny, my wife and I were driving just yesterday and I suggested we listen to Dune as an audiobook. I'd read it maybe 10 years ago, and I had just started rereading the book in Kindle format, but it was new to her (though she does enjoy sci-fi). She couldn't get into it because of the strange names and the volume of exposition. And I found that when I got past the chapters I'd read a few days earlier, I struggled to process the words when they weren't fresh in my mind.

Just consider this passage and try to imagine it from the perspective of someone who doesn't know the story already: 

""Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis for eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, mélange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete—an apparent victory for the Duke Leto.""",diavolomaestro,2020-09-21T18:42:23Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,6

It has been really nice for getting into these dense texts without getting hung up on the details. I just finished school and I have gotten used to pouring over a dense text to make sure I'm taking accurate notes, etc., but I have appreciated this method regarding audiobooks, particularly with history books that I want to read for fun rather than study. I just finished Hamilton and Empire of the Summer Moon by S.C. Gwynne. I also gave the Narnia books a shot and I think this was a very good value - all of the books for one, and many of the readers are excellent actors (Kenneth Branaugh and Patrick Stewart, among others). I know the stories from childhood and as an adult, going and reading some young adult classics feels a little too simple for me to get into - a feeling I experienced reading physical copies of Ursula K.

iwz6ol_105,iwz6ol,"That's funny, I have a hard time reading physical books between my adhd and some slight dyslexia issues. I find myself getting to the end of paragraphs and pages, needing to go back because I don't remember, or being terribly confused and seeing it's because I misread a word.

This in mind I've read a number of lovecraft stories and was fine with them, yet Dune was my white whale in book form. I eventually came across audible, and would listen to some star wars extended universe books, as they produced em like radio shows. I'd listen as I did mindless chores and it struck me that not only did it keep me on task but I was retaining more of the book than I felt I'd normally retain.

So I went and got the dune audio book. Hearing people pronounce these strange words really helped me. By vocal inflection, I could tell much of these things apart. I was no longer guessing how kwisatz haderach was pronounced, and could focus on WHAT it was. I could understand Thufir Hawat was a compete name, and neither word was a title like mentat or ghola. The different voices helped me keep the large cast of characters differentiated. Where you needed time to sit with these things and progress at your own pace, I needed the opposite... something to sweep me along like a TV show or movie, with a kinda ""I know it's confusing, it's supposed to be. It'll make sense in time"".

4 books in the series later and I'm a big believer in audio books.

Also, once you finish Dune, a reread is really cool as all of Paul's disjointed flashes of prescience make sense. If you haven't continued with the series I highly encourage you to continue. Book 2 is a little slow, but it establishes big themes for the series, and is fairly short. Children of dune is quite good, and pays a lot of this off (they should have been one book, split similarly to how Dune was presented as 1 book in 3 acts, messiah being act 1 and children being act 2 & 3. The scifi miniseries understood this!) But Children ultimately sets up God Emperor, which has one of the most singular and unique setups I've seen in fiction, and was a heady delight to sink into.

To be clear, all of the books are enjoyable. Messiah just has a strikingly different tone to Dune. Kinda like how Empire Strikes Back is a much darker movie that doesn't end in the same note of elation that A New Hope does.

iwz6ol_123,iwz6ol,"No, not weird at all; most people who understand a language can interpret the meaning of words based on that language, or on a language with shared roots. 

So, for example: 

- “Carryall” is a word in Dune for a type of transport ship. It’s made of two simple English words, and most English speakers would be able to easily interpret its meaning. 

- “Fedaykin” is a Freman word for a type of soldier. It’s based on the Arabic “Fedayeen” for a similar type of soldier. It wouldn’t be surprising for an Arabic speaker to be able to interpret what Fedaykin means. 


- Dune uses the word “Arafel” defined in text as “cloud darkness at the end of the universe” and based on the Hebrew word for “fog” which is typically used in an apocalyptic sense. So basically a 1:1 usage of the word, which a Hebrew speaker would recognize.

Book 1 is well done and got me excited for some epic things in the rest of the story but it just never comes together.

So many storylines are so poorly concluded. Paul’s son we never meet dying, Thufir expiring with a hasty apology to Jessica, the Fremen effortlessly overrunning the Harkonnen in a page and an entire chapter of exposition about how Paul would rule the universe. It felt so rushed and anti-climactic.

And then the cheese of it all, my god. Riding giant sand worms?? Stilsuits recycle your feces and urine? Most of the character dialog from the Fremen is pretty bad and cringe, it comes off as an author trying to do their best impression of an indigenous population with inexplicable sage wisdoms.

My excitement for the movie has nosedived, but then again I thought Blade Runner 2049 greatly surpassed its source material so who knows.

And no! Most shocking is it is not even known as a cult classic - it is cemented as a classic and seminal science fiction literature. And it's world-building which is lazy orientalism. That is essentially the book - just rampant orientalism and static Mary Sue characters galore. Oh except for the evil villain..who is...uh really evil...like all the time. 

And to act like there is any literary significance is laughable. Even when you try to get into the weeds all you find is mundane, predictable misogyny, orientalism, and other problematic world views. Backward Arabs and a pedophilic homosexual villain. Uh ok? What's the value in any of that?

I've just finished Dune for the second time, and 20 odd years have done little to change my perception of it. I have to agree with the original poster here.

picpez_17,picpez,"The truth is the prose is not very good. The characters and plot are average. But the world building is amazing. 

These are similar problems people have with Lord of the Rings (only not as bad) and alot of  early SF/F.

The first time I tried to read Dune I didn't get far.
This isn't because it was too deep or the wrong genre for me. I've read plenty of works of literature and am also a lover of scifi and fantasy. 

I read it the 2nd attempt. Really the Lady Jessica and the concept of the Bene Gesserit were the fascinating parts for me, especially their Missionara Protectiva.

Overall it was  fine/average plot. The Hero was not a compelling character, but his mother and some others were. The dense world building and ecology was interesting and original. Tje idea of a space opera without computer bases advanced technology but rather all biological, genes and chemicals. More ribofunk than cyberpunk.

Dune, similar to Lord of the Rings, is NOT  about the characters or plot but about the world building.
In Dune, its about basic ideas of ecology and economics if taken to extreme conclusions in a galactic empire scale.

There is too much exposition (telling not showing) compared to alot of books, partially neccessary to understand the world building but it gets much worse in the  2nd and 3rd of the first trilogy. And I've heard it gets weaker and weaker.

I enjoy Dune, but the major gold nugget there is dense original world building and seeing economic and ecological ideas on a vast galactic scope.

picpez_18,picpez,"Nice troll. Dune is a philosophical novel. When you read Dune think Hemingway and iceberg theory, the good stuff is in the subtext. I'm not saying he did this on the same level as Hemingway but Dune is more dense that anything he wrote. Jung, Nietzsche, Islam, Zen Buddhism, artificial selection vs natural selection, it's all there.

The theme that is closest to the surface is how the power of myth and story telling can fool us into blindly following a hero who might not have our best interest in mind. Even if he does absolute power corrupts absolutely.

In Dune, if you like the story, you get so caught up in the hero's journey you ignore the obvious signs. The signs that Paul will become a tyrant. To complicate things more Paul isn't evil he's just a normal human ethically speaking, he does had good intentions.

So even if you or the best person you can think of had this power it probably won't work out for everybody else.

picpez_22,picpez,"Reading the comments here made me feel smooth-brained for enjoying it so much. Most of my gripes with the Dune franchise come from the other novels in the series. For Dune, though. I don't know, I think its really tight, as a novel. That isn't to say I think it is perfect. The characters are cartoonish, the ecological and social dispensation of Arrakis beggars belief... but to me they are all such lovable cartoons.  I found the whole story and setting rather captivating, and found certain stretches of Frank's prose genuinely nice to read. Tackling themes like prescience, environmental adaptation, military prowess... sure its all, kind of ridiculous, but I can be pretty gullible when I like what I am being sold, so I could suspend disbelief and just sort of be there in the cave seitch, in awe of all this. 

Really, he threads together a lot of beads here, and in combinations that I found highly stimulating. I can't fault anyone for any of their complaints, though, since, by the 4th novel in the series, each and every one of these points is proven valid, but wow, the tremendous gulfs that exist between people's tastes!! 

I have read and had great enjoyment of several works that are considered challenging, like, Thomas Pynchon or, the whole Trojan War cycle, from the Iliad to the Aeneid, and I tell you with no bluff, I rank Dune alongside them in terms of Raw Enjoyment... alas, Dune is fake and plastic and everyone is sort of one-dimensional and none of the physics work, and the series spins further and further off into high silliness, making it difficult to defend my high praise of the first book. Nonetheless, this surrealist greek tragedy in outer space that pits the cursed house of atreus against a corporatist mercantile consortium and some sort of matriarchal eugenicist Jesuit order, with some Sunni exiles who learned Zen in a brightly lit wasteland while tripping absolute face in a honeycomb of caves... no way man Dune is awesome",omegawvlf,2023-01-15T09:20:00Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,22

Dune has quite a deep story-line with political, religious, post-apocalyptic, and psychological aspects. I would agree that not everyone would like it, but the way this comment has been worded seems harsh.

Reason why I did come across this comment is that I was more looking for thoughts on the new Dune movie. I find it very disappointing considering that they changed a lot of aspects in the book for the worse, and it seems it's a personal interpretation of how they think Dune should be, not to mention, also fiddling with getting A-listers in the cast rather than getting the right cast.

The only saving-face I could give for the Dune 2021 movie is that it places a lot of explanation by the characters, but even that is a killer as I think the explanations could have been done through acting and cinematography instead of words that wouldn't have been said in realistic scenarios.

picpez_30,picpez,"I read Dune years ago but, for whatever reason, found myself wanting to give it another shot recently. However, on second reading, I found it even more problematic than before. Now, I'm perfectly capable of differentiating between a book that's bad and a book that I don't like so, to be clear, Dune is incredibly verbose but written well enough and mashes together enough tropes to be memorable but... I personally don't rate it. My mile high conclusion is that, on the realness spectrum of Star Wars - Tau Zero it ranks kinda low and there's one gaping plot hole that I literally could not get over. Spice.

&#x200B;

Why in the name of sweet zombie mother Bene Gesserit can nobody in the entire universe synthesis worm poop? You're trying to sell me on the idea of a galactic empire spanning millions of worlds, trillions of people, spacecraft the size of Borg cubes on steroids and wars so vast they make DS9's Dominion Wars look like two caveman clubbing each other with sticks whilst still acting like synthesing a chemical compound is too difficult? I mean, if Arrakis is the only source in the universe then how did the empire even develop in the first place? Maybe that gets explained in one of the nine million spin offs but for me it was a straight up magic mcguffin explanation I'd expect from a Marvel film.

&#x200B;

It's pretty clear that Herbert was getting cliff notes from Gibbon because the empire comes off like some Romanesque dynastic struggle between fractious clans. But again, the thing I didn't get was why, if spice is the most important thing in the entire universe and critical for the functioning of the empire, why, for the love of our sweet lord and saviour Paul, did the emperor not just claim it as his own personal fiefdom? I mean, if you haven't got Arrakis then you haven't got an empire so just find a comfy planet nearby, setup shop there and keep it under constant watch. But no, lets go through the drama of having warring houses fight over who gets dibs on the most valuable thing in the universe and hope nobody goes rogue, threatens their stranglehold on spice and cause dire empire wide consequences. I'm sure that would never happen, right?. I'm sure it would never take 900 pages to make that point, RIGHT?

&#x200B;

But beyond the high level problems I dislike the broad stroke depiction of native societies (would have been referred to as savage in Herbert's time) as being better than technologically advanced societies simply because... er, they haven't got technology. So throw in a dash of Dances with Wolves and Avatar but make the environment so impossibly hostile that you need technology to survive in it anyway but it's totally okay because they were there first and worm poop is sacred or something. Anyway, desert dwellers are the good guys and it's fine when they kill people but the harvesters picking up poop are definitely bad and don't get to kill anyone. It comes across as simplistic and kinda white saviour to be honest. The Fremen are up the creek with no canoe until Mubbly Bubbly Dib Dib Paul turns up in his golden chariot pulled by silver steeds to save the day. Oh and he can totally ride worms better than anyone else. AND he has cooler visions too.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile the world itself just feels silly. Since spice is basically space LSD I guess it makes sense that the world comes across as all style and no substance. Why do the force fields work against anything except for slow moving things? Meh, plot device for cool sword fights and Byzantine style internecine warfare. Why doesn't the empire just ship in a million billion troops to hunt down every Fremen and crucify them pirate style a la Julius Caesar? Meh, white Jesus needs some savages to save. Why do virtually all significant plot developments/insights come courtesy of a prophecy or vision? Hey, Delphic Oracles are cool right? Why can't the galactic empire that's entirely dependant on worm poop synthesise it? Whooooh, mysterious huh?

&#x200B;

I can understand people liking Dune because it throws a lot of ideas at the wall but for me virtually everything it does feels cursosry. Paul is more trope than character, Fremen are there to be saved, Harkonnen are the bad guys who are bad because they're bad whilst Atreides are good because they smile nicely when extorting your tax. Perhaps the style over substance narrative is why I actually quite liked Lynch's Dune in the 80's because, for me, it felt like Dune; over the top, silly, stylised and fun so long as you tried not to think too much about it. The newer Dune films come off as sombre, po-faced Daniel Craig era James Bond affairs. If your subject matter is white Jesus saving magic space worms to harvest worm poop for your galactic empire driven by stoners then I'll take that whacky stylised aesthetic over brown and grey sobriety.

&#x200B;

Anyway, Dune is very stylish but don't think too much about it because you'd need to be on spice for it to make sense.",that-big-wet-one-696,2024-03-31T14:18:43Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,30

Dune (the first book, I am not brave enough to see the film and not throw up) is absolutely hopelessly bad. It has the most generic feudal fantasy story just set in space and the dialogue was crafted by a simpleton. The tension is forced. All the story is either people being surprised at a McGuffin or being so edgy that you could cut diamonds. It's the same bullshit as Harry Potter or a dollar store Jesus story. The laser hitting the shield to cause a nuclear explosion is just: oh dear GOD, it's so bad it makes me belch. All it was, is proper logic defenestration.

There's simply no philosophy in there. There's not world-shattering thought or great moral or underlying ultimate idea.

picpez_56,picpez,"Just going to hit the main points, don't feel like writing an essay.

Nietzsche: 

People throughout history have often used religion to justify the creation of, or maintaining of, a moral code that serves their motivations, and what motivates them is their will to power. This is the Missionaria Protectiva. 

Nietzsche also placed high value on suffering and going through hardships as a way to make you stronger. The two strongest groups of warriors are the fremen and the sardaukar, the explanation for their strength in the novel is that they both grew up in extremely harsh environments. ""Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger."" quote by Nietzsche.

Jung:

 Jung's theory of archetypes inspired the characterization in Dune. 

The idea of genetic memories is a metaphor for Jung's idea of the collective unconscious. 

Men in Dune can be mentats, who are very logical and analytic, skills more associated with conscious thought, they ""can't"" be Bene Gesserit. Woman can be Bene Gesserit who are more instinctual and intuitive, skills more associated with the unconscious, they ""can't"" be mentats. Jung thought that we all need to incorporate both the masculine and feminine aspects of our unconscious to become our true selves. Paul, ya know the main character of the book, is the first we see who is capable of being both Bene Gesserit and mentat. Whether or not this is true I don't know but it's defiantly in the book.

Zen Buddhism:

Zensunni is the religion of the fremen which is a combination of sunni islam and Zen Buddhism. But it's been awhile since I've read it and I can't remember if this ties in thematically. So you got me there.

Herbert was not the pioneer of this thought. This was the main philosophical talking point during this time in history. Herbert was an intelligent voice in the discussion and the Dune series did a great job at philosophically exploring these ideas. However, the series did a poor job of creating content that is engaging enough to care.  


And that's the big challenge. How to present prose that involves the reader enough in the character's journey to follow through and subconsciously absorb the large philosophical concepts.  


For decades after the release of *Dune*, this philosophical debate of using tech to control things was popular. Herbert was not a god and he was not as gifted writer as his fans proclaim.

There is a great amount of depth there. The languages are not made up, the entire book was heavily researched and planned out rather well and it does mirror the ideal of the times. (The rest of the series... well, I can't really say).

Because, the characters within the book portray the exact opposite of this. (e.g. only the strongest/smartest/most enlightened survive).

elitism -  ""someone who believes that some things should be controlled or owned only by the richest or best educated people""

Yes, what my knowledge grants me is a clearer view of the world.

I am a cog in this machine of society. This is the only place from which I can attempt to improve it's function.

A cell in an incredibly small part of a human body, and yet it can still wreck havoc or create vast changes upon it's environment.

The belief that you are powerless and worthless and unable to change the world that you live in is defeatism. The rich and powerful tell you to accept the world the way it is. However they do not operate under this assumption themselves. They attempt to manipulate it to their own ends. They have no more power than you do in reality, but your acceptance grants them power over you.

I'm sure that the single celled organisms (humor me, and consider them cognizant) which eventually formed humanity after millions of years felt they were worthless. And in another million years, perhaps we will have colonized different star systems? (We are worthless, but our lives have worth and continue to direct our species, and eventually our species will have an impact on our galaxy, then several galaxies... and then the universe).

The problem is that you're attempting to use the ""big picture analogy"" to invalidate everything. This doesn't work, because you have no idea what your existence will eventually effect. The butterfly effect in action. The kid you smile at in the supermarket may eventually succeed in running for congress and change society because of that smile.

picpez_79,picpez,"So, about the authoritarian elitism...

I can see a book where almost all of the characters are military leaders, who give absolute commands, and the commands are carried out perfectly as authoritarian. And because they live in a universe where death and poison, political intrigue and assassinations are common, they must train themselves to their absolute fullest in order to retain their positions. For all intents and purposes an 'absolute meritocracy' is pure 'elitism'.

“I wrote the Dune series because I had this idea that charismatic leaders ought to come with a warning label on their forehead: ""May be dangerous to your health."" One of the most dangerous presidents we had in this century was John Kennedy because people said ""Yes Sir Mr. Charismatic Leader what do we do next?"" and we wound up in Vietnam. And I think probably the most valuable president of this century was Richard Nixon. Because he taught us to distrust government and he did it by example.” - Frank Herbert

His problem with those in power is that they were elected too long and were usually corrupt, prideful and stupid. In a perfect society, any single person could perform the task of leadership as they'd all be trained perfectly to do so. But we know that society is not perfect, and not everyone is capable.

I would posit that Herbert didn't have a great love for following a singular charismatic ruler blindly. The belief that your own brains and abilities determine how far you go is meritocracy (elitism). And this is the book.

&#x200B;

Why didn't you look at his actual interviews on the subject. Not from others point of view but his direct quotes and interviews. The reason I read fiction is because it provides a perfect point of view of the generation it is written in. And each time a person writes their point of view on a subject, they are espousing the ideals of their generation (myself included).

The Rings of Power, for all of it's attempting to adapt Tolkien to sell it to the new generation, actually shows the current social issues fight between the new generations and the past. (however ridiculous I might find it, it is still there).

""Philosophy and science fiction are two different genres.""

Science fiction and philosophy have been in bed since their inception. You cannot write about a fictional futuristic society without using one philosophy or another. This creates social commentary. Dystopias show flaws in our current society taken to an extreme to show social commentary.

For instance, the authoritarianism in Dune is actually a political philosophy.

""An authoritarian regime has ""a concentration of power in a leader or an elite not constitutionally responsible to the people"". Unlike totalitarian states, they will allow social and economic institutions not under governmental control, and tend to rely on passive mass acceptance rather than active popular support""

Remind you of Dune? How about Star Wars? Starship Troopers? Tolkien?

How often do you read? How many science fiction books have you read? Almost all of them have at least 1 inherent philosophy they are trying to push, almost all of them show multiple. And it's been this way since the dawn of science fiction.

I once threw one of his books against a wall because I didn't know wtf was going on, but it was worth it.

picpez_85,picpez,"ah, Hellsing Ultimate, I'm familiar with it. I liked the story of Vampire Hunter D a little more. And I never could quite understand why Alucard was so freaking powerful. (He faced off against that other older vampire in the show).

ANYWAY.

I hold directors on big budget movies to a high caliber. If you have an insane budget in comparison... why do you get outclassed by B movies? Or far cheaper movies?

I see a movie like Snatch. It's fun, the story is engaging easy and simple.

NO stealing fame from a previous book or title. No characters pulled. All memorable.

10 million budget. Made 83 million. 8x profit.

Or Rocky. Simple story, even the boxing wasn't so great, they shot cheaply and efficiently. Each scene builds to climax and completes. It made so much money that they are still not done making sequels. 47... years... later...

<1 million budget. Made 225 million. 200x profit. (the next 3 sequels are around the same numbers too).

&#x200B;

Dune. 165 million. Made 402 million. less than 2.5 profit. These aren't big numbers in today's box office. 

&#x200B;

Consider Thor: Ragnarok 180 million cost. 855 million profit.

&#x200B;

What does Ragnarok have that Dune is missing? It's based on a book (well, book series). The characters were a bit better known. The prior thor movie wasn't as well received and they didn't have a lot of hope going into it, so not everyone went into the theatre with high hopes... but it was a hit. They made changes to their formulae.

There was a humanity given to Loki and his character actually grew. (What do you know? People actually like 3 dimensional villains today.)

Daredevil on Netflix did great. Cheap to cast and shoot. The Kingpin was a switched to a tortured character and the backstory changed a little but the essence of what he was stuck. (3 dimensional bad guy)

Because Denis removed the guts from Dune, he created cartoon villains. Not even comic book, like pre school Disney villains. Why are you being an evil bastard? ...Because... I look like one. (OMG so insightful).

And every protagonist is only as good as the evil he overcomes. When you have a weak villain you lose a sense of purpose. (The Mandarin ring any bells?)

By cutting out the reason and why and how you reduced a Grandiose evil conniving Baron to a mere fat slob barely even given screen time. Feyd is no longer (let's face it, he was pretty much described as Vega from streetfighter)... he's become an eyebrow-less horror. 

Straight up, if you're richer than sin, you own a planet... are you literally going to make yourself look like some kind of a zombie?

""I think I'll shave my head and eyebrows, bleach my skin and drink ink for a while... that will win over my subjects."" - yeah. totally. naturally.

Evil people are not obvious.

""Where's your costume dear?""

""I don't have a costume. I'm a homicidal maniac; they look just like everyone else.""

People like movies which IMITATE life.

That's why you see Rocky do so well. He didn't even win the freaking match. But he fought the good fight. We've all been used and abused by life.

Have you seen Shall We Dance? The Japanese version? It's freaking beautiful. It did so well it created ballroom dance culture in Japan. 

Altered a people's way of life and culture. If you haven't seen it. Here you go.

It's not even sad and it will make you choke up because you feel for the guy. It shows life, and you connect with the characters on the screen. They didn't even think the guy could do it, because his previous roles were Samurai.

3j3cz7_19,3j3cz7,"As others have stated, the sand worms/trout are an invasive species. Their effects on the environment of Arrakis make life more difficult for every creature. 

Let's also note that one could strongly argue that Herbert was talking about gasoline when he was talking melange (I think he might have even stated this). Melange is a substance mined from the ground, the use of which enables travel and commerce as well as increasing the quality of life of a privileged class.

Conversely, the production, trade and use of melange supports entrenched hierarchies, allowing inept rulers to maintain control. It does not increase innovation and progress, but rather leads to a stagnant and backwards society. This is why the golden path includes the practical destruction of all institutions and why Paul could take down the Padishah emperor so easily. 

The spice is a crutch for a system that would otherwise fall. Systems full of corruption which impede progress and require entire sectors of society to be strictly repressed. Systems that enrich a small group, limit opportunity for all others, and rely on the scarcity of an essential resource to increase wealth. Systems whose hold on power makes a progressive and productive future implausible. 

While Dune doesn't say much about global warming directly, it says a whole lot about gasoline.

3j3cz7_34,3j3cz7,"What is happening on Earth, like on Dune, is far more nuanced than many would like to believe.

- There is clear evidence from climate researchers at ANU that the increased amount of CO2 has clearly contributed to the greening of the planet earth as observed during the past three decades.

- The climate has always varied wildly, and the correlation between our release of gases and increases in temperature is lacking, including a lack of temperature increase right now, and periods during emissions where the temperature has gone down. The very thought that there should be a correlation at all based on lab experiments with CO2 is also dubious, as the earth has a massive self-regulating ecosystem which has dealt with far higher levels of CO2.

- Even if there actually was such a warming effect, would that really be bad? Is our planet at the optimum global temperature now? Probably not, as the increases in economic activity in cold countries seem to be greater when it gets warmer in general, than the decreases in economic activity in already warm countries. In fact, several of these dry, warm places are actually the places where the increase in CO2 is most beneficiary to vegetation, places like Australia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

These are only a few points, there is a large amount of evidence directly contradicting the mainstream idea about anthropogenic global warming, and rather showing a series of other peculiarities, like how more CO2 in the air, barring problems like local pollution, can actually be good.

I personally believe that the science behind the entire ordeal has become severely corrupted by pressure and money from states and other international organizations, and that if anyone were to look at the actual data, like a true scientist, they would discover the same.

Nothing conspiratorial about it, science gets corrupted from time to time in history, and when it happens, it is better to look at the actual data and evidence, and then throw out the wrong hypotheses and theories.",Filostrato,2015-08-31T18:22:56Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,34

Children of Dune is one of my favorite. There are just some scenes that I am really into. Some people don't care for the message and they want the style of the first back. God Emperor is a shit load of dialogue and about half the people who read it get hung out to dry on it, for some they can't enjoy the two books after that at all - IMHO the fourth book is a huge elaboration on some of the choices that a particular character makes between the third and fourth. And Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse are fucking amazing. Miles Teg is a badass and I think the story is pretty damn fun! 

Some people really want some continuity of a sort - but when you're jumping thousands of years between some books, you just got to expect shit to shift, otherwise you will be disappointed. Some people are *only* about the first and, I feel like they're setting a standard that prevents them from enjoying the other aspects that you find in the other books.

If you approach them with an open mind and take them for what it's worth, all six books are a great ride. The commentary and philosophy never leaves his books and his style is amazing to boot.

Sure, it *is* canon according to Frank's son and the publishers. Which is only one level of canon. Everything is canon *to a degree*. We just don't talk on that level. 


Star Wars is a similar set-up, with tiers of what is considered canon and what level they are. Almost all the novels I grew up on used to be considered like second rate canon because it was authorized by Lucasarts, with George's blessing. Now it's all considered Legends because of Disney and none of it is ""true"" anymore. The difference being that the majority of the Star Wars novels are considered Space Operas and aren't quite on the same level as Dune as far as a believable and dedicated universe goes. Seeing as it was all done by one man and there were a great many authors who wrote Star Wars books


So it's mostly because it isn't Frank's work and can scarcely even compare, and certainly doesn't have his stamp of approval. Tolkien's son did it right with Unfinished Tales and Silmarillion, Brian and his co-writer did it wrong with a series of books that could never capture his father's genius.",,2015-09-01T00:56:55Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,68
uo1cmv_1,uo1cmv,"I think Dune benefits a lot from rereading, but part of its charm is that disorientation you feel when first opening it up. I remember thinking during the Gom Jabbar scene, ""Are there animal-people in this world, not just human-people?""--not understanding the philosophical point about the refined instincts of humanity versus the base instincts.

And that disorientation is part of the immersion. Dune does a great job of ""show, don't tell."" There are many contextual clues for the things you were puzzled about, but it's up to you to make sense of them.

I also believe the experience of the novel changes as you, the reader, mature, and can pick up more subtleties of the text. (Or know more about the author's intent).

A first time reader may conclude: ""Paul is the chosen one, a hero, and this is his story.""

A second time reader: ""Paul is the hero, but a false chosen one, and this is his story.""

And a third time: ""Paul is a self-aware protagonist, a false chosen one, trying to stop himself from becoming a hero because that's really a villain, and this is the story of his failure against the inevitability of human instinct.""

>!You gradually piece together that mankind DID have advanced computers and technology, but it became oppressive. The Butlerian Jihad in earlier ages eradicated this technology and set in place the mantra of ""man over machine."" As a result, man turned toward self-improvement and tuning the senses to superhuman levels. The various ""schools"" took different approaches toward improving the mind and body, and compete for influence over the universe. It's in this context that Dune takes place, and all the strange parts of its worldbuilding make sense as a logical extrapolation of this principle.

This is the story of a “great man” at a pivotal moment in his life. The tension doesn’t derive from fear he might die, but that he will fail, and lose his grip on the messianic figure he has become, killing trillions. If you need life or death tension, then it’s there, for the other characters whose fate is not so certain. Many characters die in Dune, usually when the story has run its course with them.

And honestly, the appendix is your friend. There’s basically nothing in their that can spoil the story. Dune is trying to provide a picture of a world unfathomably far in the future, so it would be weird if they did not have concepts that are foreign to us. Plus, some, like Usul and Muad-Dib, are explained the moment they arrive in the text; they’re Paul’s name among his tribe, one personal, one public.

I don’t think Dune is for everyone; it’s kind of supposed to be boring, if you can’t find fascination in the political and religious intrigue or musings on philosophy and fate. The endings are usually explosive because the books painstakingly set up the climaxes from the beginning of the books, many of which are 500+ pages.

And Tolkien’s kind of a bad comparison, because he used concepts that were not only around for thousands of years, but were also popularized by his works.

2) Your LOTR comment. You need to remember when LOTR was released. Reading them in the 21st century gives you the benefit of decades of pop culture knowledge that hasn't really happened for Dune.

OP to answer one of your questions the Spacer Guild, as far as I understood, is the most powerful faction in the Dune Universe. They are in essence the OPEC of the Dune universe in that they are the ones that control the economy via their monopoly on interplanetary travel (much like how OPEC controls much of the economy of the Middle East).

I had largely walked away from A Scanner Darkly by the time I watched the movie, and I was a third of the way through Dune when I watched the remake. Honestly, watching Dune made it a lot easier and more enjoyable to go back to reading the book - less of my mental energy was focused on trying to imagine and keep track of everything, and I was better able to enjoy the much deeper story that the movie skipped over. It's been a while since I watched or picked up A Scanner Darkly, but I'll probably rewatch it (even just in the background while I'm doing other things) before I revisit the book.",,2022-05-12T14:28:48Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,20

Also, I personally find it immersive that the book throws you into the world and doesn't feel the need to invent characters to explain words that in the world (which bad books do all the time, if it were real, wouldn't be explained ever.

The terms are household words to the characters and after that's accepted, reading DUNE becomes amazing because of it. So much criticism is focused on this one element which is actually a story telling strength. And to compare that type of writing with a book using general fantasy terms as a better example of world. building is strange, because it's way more interesting to have a world with new words unfold before you. Why would changing all the names to easily discernible tropes like King, Valuable Cinnamon Fuel/Drug and God Boy be better? 

I wish more readers wouldn't get so caught up on understanding the vocabulary immediately. The point to me is not to understand them and just let the culture of Arrakis surround you.",jilko,2022-05-13T00:31:14Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,32
uo1cmv_33,uo1cmv,"What I love about dune is that Frank Herbert writes it as if the reader is a part of the story. What I mean by that is that the book is written in a way that assumes you know just as much about the universe as the characters do. To me, upon re-reading it, it gives me a deeper understanding of the intense monologues that the characters have. He doesn't bother giving explanations of the things the characters say or think, because they wouldn't stop to explain them.

And as for the idea of a ""chosen one"" character, I think that Paul plays a very unique version of this archetype, especially for the time the book was written. Paul is a very flawed character, and makes poor decisions. He sees a glimpse of the destruction he causes later in the series, thinks ""I should stop that from happening"" and then continues to make decisions that keep him on that path.

In Messiah we see that his revolution has brought war to the entire galaxy, caused a massive death toll, destroyed the Fremen culture and Paul himself is worshiped as a God and he's not happy with the way any of it went. He's not a savior, he almost destroyed everything and spends the book trying to correct his wrongs, which is ultimately paid off in Children of Dune.

xkp8lh_5,xkp8lh,"First off: the book stymied me greatly, and audio books got me through the series. I also found the sequels to be easier to follow as there wasn't the dumping of EVERYTHING on me. Dune has a lot of world to cover, from Landsraad & CHOAM, Bene Gesserits & Mentats, Spacing Guilds & Sarduakar, to all the names of characters, Kwisatz Haderach, Lisan Al Gaib, the Butlerian Jihad, and spice. There's a LOT to take in. Subsequent books, while there's often new stuff, nothing ever hits the same point of overwhelming like the first book IMO.

Secondly: keep going. Take a break if you need it, but continue in the series. Know that while book 1 is a coming of age story, book 2 is a political thriller that turns your opinion of book 1 on it's ear. Things hinted at in the first book are laid clear and the larger themes of the series start to come to the forefront. Book 3, Children of Dune, is where a number of people peace out. I loved book 3, despite some of its stranger bits. It is definitely a culmination of story from the first two, and wraps up just about everything for all characters. However, there's a notable hook at the end for the next book. Spoiler free and vague, sorry 😆. But that hook had me dive headlong into God Emperor of Dune, book 4. Each book gets more weird shit than the last, but imo book 4 is the pinnacle of the series. The tie in with book 3 is astounding, and all the themes of the first books are laid bare, and hammered home. We're given some heady philosophical and political musings, but the whole reason for Paul to have been set in motion is seen. In addition to some delightfully strange shit. For as influential as the series is, I've never seen sci fi do quite what Frank Herbert pulls with God Emperor. That being said, it's funny how many TV/movies etc I've noticed that take some strong elements from it. From Westworld to Loki, Game of Thrones and more.

I'd end there by the way. He wrote 2 more books, and the silly shit kinda outweighs everything in em. Fans like to act like his son's continuation of the series is some great degradation of the books, and while that argument isn't hard to make, dad's last two has lots of needlessly weird shit. From chair dogs (living dogs manipulated genetically into being chairs) and cat-humans, to a race of space nuns who enslave men by administering ""vaginal pulsing"". God Emperor ends with a neat tie up of everything, and without the big hook end that Children had. It really felt like Frank put a period at the end of his thought. Which made the last two feel like after thoughts, full of author insertion, and goofy weird shit. The other books have plenty of weirdness, and there's author insertion, but books 5 and 6 it feels like the scales tipped in the wrong direction.

So yeah, to recap: Audio books are great and the dune series is very well done in audio. Book 1 will change it's color to you as you process books 2 3 and 4. People who only read DUNE miss out on the themes of the series, and will have the wrong impressions of characters. Imagine if there was a book about a struggling artist who finally finds his speaking voice and confidence. Then in book 2 he rises to power and it becomes blatantly clear it's Adolf Hitler. But lots of people didn't progress past book 1, so they view 'Dolf as a hero of his own story.

xkp8lh_12,xkp8lh,"Honestly? I really enjoy the world building and conflict of the beginning, but the ending kind of ruined my ability to see the book as any sort of masterpiece.

The last part felt incredibly rushed compared to the beginning. The time skip disconnects us from all the growing and work it takes Paul to get to the end point of avoiding his Jihad. The sacrifice of Paul’s son felt hollow since we never actually meet the kid. The one slightly interesting tangent in the third part was the poison knife sabotage with the Duke’s heir. 

Also not a fan of the last “History will remember us as wives” line. It’s supposed to be triumphant but it just feels condescending and a strange beat to end on.

xkp8lh_26,xkp8lh,"For my experience I have to go back to the first time I read it. My older brother loved Dune. It was his favorite book and he always would tell me I have to read it. I was never a sci-fi fan. My 2 older brothers would hog the tv and would watch Star trek when it came on and I wanted to watch Happy Days. Yes, I am from another time. So by the time I got around to reading Dune it was 1992. I was just out of the Navy, not working yet and had plenty of time on my hands. I must say, I friggin loved it. I was blown away by it. It was slow going but it had such an intrigue about it. Especially the political aspect. I was expecting hard science but I felt this could have been a story with almost any setting when it came to the cutthroat deceit and then also the Witchery could have been a setting of knights and dragons with different houses. It was all new to me and it did make me a fan of Science Fiction and even fantasy. I used to read mostly nonfiction and Stephen King. Not much else. 

Fast forward several years and I still think very highly of the book. But I have really noticed that generations after my time do not love Dune the way people of my time did. I really feel like a lot of writers were influenced by it and maybe the newer writers have more action in their novels. 

As for the sequels. I think Dune can be a stand alone with a lot of unanswered questions. I thought the next novel was really good though. The 3rd pretty good. The rest of them I’d read with caution. One of them lost me big time. The one where all I could think of was Jaba the Hut and he was a few thousand years old. It got weird.",MattTin56,2022-09-22T21:56:46Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,26

The tie in with book 3 is astounding, and all the themes of the first books are laid bare, and hammered home. We're given some heady philosophical and political musings, but the whole reason for Paul to have been set in motion is seen. In addition to some delightfully strange shit.

xkp8lh_33,xkp8lh,"I did not struggle at all with Frank's writing style. It's definitely a different kind of narrative than I was used to. It was a little bit less about building the mystery through the narrative and more about exploring the mystery of the vast world building. It's also not what I would classify as terribly poetic, and it can feel like quite a slow read at times.

But I also had people try to turn me off of Tolkien because it was ""so slow"" and ""difficult to get through"". I can't tell you how many times I've listened to people lament about the number of paragraphs that were used to describe a tree. And yet I loved nearly every word of Lord of the Rings. Same goes for Dune.

Dune Messiah is a little bit of a departure, still more good than bad, but I experienced the kind of ""slowness"" in Dune Messiah that I think people are talking about with Dune itself. Children of Dune picked up quite a lot for me and I really enjoyed it. I plan on reading the next 3 books here soon, but after 1800 pages of dead serious political-religious-cultural-ecological-family intrigue, I needed to take a bit of a break for other stories.",TheSiegmeyerCatalyst,2022-09-22T20:14:15Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,33
xkp8lh_34,xkp8lh,"I think it depends a lot from what the reader expects or is used to, and how much the reader actually wants to absorb beyond the main plot lines. 

I didn't find the 1st and 2nd book particularly difficult, but they definitely hold the readers hands WAY less than most fictions out there, adult or young. Frank Hebert introduces a lot of concepts without previous explanations, that you just really get familiar as you keep reading. But yet, I didn't find it very complex to understand.

But when it comes to prescient memories and spice trips things can really become quite insane sometimes.

I think FH had an awesome and very smart writing style though. Many things in the plot have bigger meanings and bigger consequences than they apparently do in the first contact... Like, it's crazy to see what happens in CoD and GEoD just based on the first book, and yet everything feels smartly put together.

xkp8lh_36,xkp8lh,"I just kept reading tbh. Children of Dune is probably the heaviest on the prescient memories and other ""supernatural"" stuff, hence why I found it to be the hardest to absorb. It also talks a lot about an structure called qanat that I couldn't quite figure out in my mind how it was suppose to look or work (I have seen what it means irl, and it gave me an idea, but the description that is given in the book looks like something different still).

However it also concludes most of the plot introduced in Dune, and also introduces one of the most interesting characters. Imo, the book gets considerably more interesting halfway through, because it becomes more plot oriented.

You also need it to start God Emperor of Dune, which is quite divisive. Some find GEoD to be one of, if not the best in the series (some consider it the worst though). I adored GEoD and, imho, it was for different reasons as interesting and entertaining to me as the 1st book!

xkp8lh_37,xkp8lh,"The way I try to explain it to people is that Dune is largely about set-up. Dune is 900 pages because he is:

* building the world for you to get lost in
* teaching you all about the individual and group players in that world
* establishing the rules by which the above two operate, and
* giving you the end of the yarn ball to begin tugging on

The mystery is is not expressed through narrative weaving that's designed to make you keep guessing. The mystery exists as a function of the world being so large, with so many moving parts. You're watching action and reaction play out on a massive scale, like a huge Rube Goldberg machine. Pieces of the puzzle aren't exactly hidden from you, but you're always guessing about how exactly the next ""domino"" is going to fall.

In that sense, Dune is a fantastic self contained story in and of itself. But in order to go beyond that, he needed to go back and do some more work building. That's what Dune Messiah and the first half of Children of Dune is all about. He's building a new Rube Goldberg machine using many parts from the original one. And once it is set up, the payoff is immense. You get to watch all the machinery fall into place. The Rube Goldberg machine flies into action once more.",TheSiegmeyerCatalyst,2022-09-22T20:33:19Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,37

I would agree with this, but only with Dune Messiah, which I believe is the shorter book, and indeed not really hard to follow (but you definitely need to have read the 1st book). But I don't mean it as a negative critic to Messiah, because I think it's a brilliant book and for me it was also the most emotive, in a good sense. 

But CoD and GEoD are quite large books and quite unique. And CoD was definitely the hardest one to absorb in my experience.

I've always disagreed with this critique. It's not even that it was supposed to have occurred quickly. It's that it just doesn't matter. To Herbert, violence is an integral part of the political conflict he is exploring, but the details are irrelevant, so why would he belabor them?

Everything else moves relatively slowly, because detail is required to understand the complex political machinations and philosophical ruminations he's exploring. Violence is easy to understand. One side beats the other by either overpowering or outmaneuvering them. The conflict itself rarely reveals anything new about the characters. If you understand the state of things going in, the way things play out is a foregone conclusion.

None of that is to say action is worthless in other types of stories. It can be entertaining in it's own right. Showing characters under duress can be revealing of their nature. It can be important to set the very human stakes of the story's conflict. None of that applies to Dune's final conflict. In many ways it would counter the central theme about the danger of the messiah. The people doing the fighting aren't even people anymore. They won't be people again until they come back from the jihad completely broken and without a soul.",Solesaver,2023-05-02T12:40:36Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,18

All depends on the book and the author's vision :)

135boux_25,135boux,"I think it was explained very thoroughly. It was described how, not just the emperor, but the entire entourage of the imperial court was on the planet's surface, because there was *no possible way* they could be in any danger. It's actually a very common historical pattern that is set up throughout the entire back half of the book.

The Sardaukar couldn't admit how strong the Fremen were, the Harkonnens were actively hiding their losses so the emperor wouldn't turn on them too, and of course *nobody* could admit there was even the tiniest possibility that Paul and Jessica had survived. As far as the emperor was concerned they were just going to be watching the Sardaukar, the most elite soldiers in the empire, executing the local savages who dared to stand up against the mighty empire.

It's not even like they were on the front lines either. There was the largest mountains on the planet between them and the untamed wilderness. They were theoretically in one of the safest locations on the planet.

At its heart, Dune is a book about political intrigue. This makes it very dense at times, but all the information is there. You may disagree with Herbert on what's reasonable for different people to think or do, but he is incredibly rigorous at defining the parameters and philosophies behind all the different faction and character motivations.",Solesaver,2023-05-03T00:38:21Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,25

Absolutely! To further belabor the point, that entire scene does a lot of heavy lifting at the same time. It reveals so much information very efficiently about the individual characters and broader factions. Herbert chose to draw out that scene exactly for that reason.

It was a first contact with the Fremen, it was Paul's turning point into manhood, it was a re-appraisal of Jessica's fear and love as a mother, it was the beginning of Paul's conscious journey towards the terrible jihad, it showed Fremen philosphies around violence and tradition, it showed the division between forward facing and backward looking Fremen mindsets, and so much more.

Correct me if I'm wrong or missing any subtleties on that though, it's been a while since I've read these; may do a reread for the hell of it before the new film is released this year.

On that note since you're a fan and like gushing about Dune what did you think about the recent film adaptation? If you care to share that is.

I actually haven't watched the movie because, despite the rave reviews, I don't think Dune would make a good movie. Either it's going disappoint me by being a bad movie, or it's going to disappoint me by being a bad adaptation. I'll get around to it eventually I'm sure, but I'm pretty resistant.

3. Postquels (Hunters of Dune, Sandworms of Dune)

I like the prequels as a standalone because it is just solid sci-fi about titans and cymeks and all that, but I believe Frank could've shared all the necessary information without the prequels.

I saw a review saying that the characters were thin. But they are thin in the book too. It's the world that is developed. Same with the movie. Paul, Jessica, Stilgar, they are all vehicles for the world building that is Dune. Clearly Paul develops in the book more than anyone else and I'm sure that will happen through the second movie as well. And the world that Herbert built is the real character.

It's like the world is this one massive character that screams impact while letting the side characters do all the talking. 

My one critique is the characters that went awol (its a movie, it happens) . One of the most interesting characters in the book isn't as large in the movie : Gurney Halleck; his hatred of the Harkonnens and his refuge in music. And  Dr Yueh. You miss the behind the scenes knowing looks as Dr Yueh follows through with his betrayal. In the book you know it's happening and you see why at the same time and even feel bad for him.

For me what stuck out was that the story has elements of dynastic/tribal conflict (the Atreides vs Harkonnen) with tropes like the sole survivor (or a small group of survivors) escaping a purge and rebuilding their power and then returning in force. Imperialism/the Emperor is basically in the background, but the real conflict was between the two factions vying for control on the ground.

Given how many governments in the Middle East look like a awful lot like the Harkonnens (defeated another dynasty to take power, rule with an iron fist over the population, have support of a powerful external backer in exchange for a crucial resource, etc) Dune looked kind of like the Middle East’s version of Animal Farm to me.",Kahzootoh,2021-10-22T05:19:43Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,34

Dune is not above reproach, it’s got plenty of flaws.

I think the problem with Dune is that it just doesn’t feel heroic like LotR. It makes you feel conflicted and it’s supposed to. You become more conscious of its flaws as the text invites you question the world it has built and even the one Paul wants to build in its place. 

LotR leaves you content and satisfied. Things were bad and they got better. The heroes complete their journey and their arcs, their intentions are noble and they fix what was broken. You never doubt whether Aragorn ruling  Gondor is wise, or whether the Elves should journey to the undying lands.

Everyone thinks about these concepts differently (if at all) and exploring them in fiction can be difficult to do in away that's approachable to audiences. Then tack on the limiting factors of film as a medium and you have a product that is ripe to divide critics and loose its plot in the attempts to convey the atmosphere of the literature through cinematography, art, music, and sound.

Also the world building is *super* dense and there's really no strong way to mitigate how much that can limit a plot.

The world building is nearly unrivaled. There's good reason why many authors have ""borrowed"" (or outright copied) from the world of Dune.

The pacing is horrid. At times it grinds to halt, and lingers in areas where it simply doesn't need too, and frankly shouldn't. To me, this is the books biggest problem.

On a side note, I still believe the 80's movie scares people away from reading the book, due to how absolutely bonkers it is. I enjoy pieces of it, for the absurdity, but it is not a good representation of the book.

It's core message of ""beware the hero"" is quite a subversive one compared to basically every myth/ legend ever (which were basically the ancestors to modern fantasy & SF tbh), which I think inherently causes readers to feel conflicted just like you were saying, and thus I think inherently will draw more flak from readers precisely because we don't come away feeling as good at the end of it",jaghataikhan,2021-10-22T03:56:02Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,57

By and large a movie paced like this isn’t the mainstream way to direct a movie not because it’s bad but because the masses want something fast and broken up by non stop action and comedy. So if you’re optimizing for money (which most movies try to). You don’t get as many movies that can take themselves seriously or have long drawn out scenes or spend time on a movies tone. That’s why by and large movies like the newer Star Wars movies, marvel movies, etc follow the same format as each other and share a lot of similar themes even when it detracts from the movie as a whole. 


But I think for dune this was a match made in heaven. The pacing of this part of the book is pretty much the same as the movie.

Apart from that, I think you can consider the 4th book, God Emperor of Dune, worth of a try. There is no need to read 2nd and 3rd books as the 4th includes a prologue.

111494d_16,111494d,"I read Frank's work in entirety at least 16 times - the first 3 books several more times than that... and the last 2 also several more times. 

Dune (book 1) is a stand-alone masterpiece. My preference of which sequel books are ""best"" has changed over the years. I used to despise God Emporer in my teens, then fell in love with the last two books (in all their weirdness) in my 20's - and now (rude to ask how old) I really enjoy God Emporer, the story is critical to the Dune universe, and has some fantastic insights. 

But - I will say that the first 3 books I think of as 1 story - God Emporer is the second story, and Chapter House & Heretics are part of the 3rd (unfinished - he was working on the final book 7 when he passed) story. I find that people who love the first story don't often like the 2nd and 3rd story - and people who love story 2 (God Emporer) typically are only ok with the first story, and loathe the third. 

Regarding Brian's work - the prequels - are supposed to have been written from Frank's world-building notes - were fun to read, and people who are fanatics of the whole series (like myself) found it fulfilling to have different houses explained, read about the Butlerian Jihad, and make connections where previously there had only been guesses or nuanced hints. Just don't expect Brian to be Frank - lower the expectation bar - and just have fun with those, if you're even interested at all after reading the first 6.

It succeeds. Messiah shows that the arc for Paul, all along, wasn't just tragic but *galactically* tragic for completely unexpected reasons. It rocks.

They were one-and-done works which suddenly wildly exceeded the expectations of the author, and they hurriedly rushed out more content to cash in on their sudden surge in popularity.

1. First book is great. But Dune Messiah really underscores Herbert's main thesis on power, and should be considered a required addendum to the series.   
2. Dune Messiah - See above  
3. Children of Dune - A good followup that maintains the energy and pace of the original book, while expanding the series in interesting ways and providing suitable closure to the initial atreides line.   
4. God Emperor of Dune: I always call it My Dinner with Andre with a giant spaceworm, because that's what it feels like. I might like it if I tried again, but it was at this point that herbert's writing took a notable shift in quality and tone.   
5. Heretics of Dune: this is where I got profoundly bored. I found none of the batch of new characters were nearly as compelling as the original cast, and the conflict between the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit was by turns confusing, disturbing, and a little too perverse for my taste (see: 12 year old sexually dominates an older woman using magical kama sutra. Shit was weird).   
6. Chapterhouse Dune: Even more boring, but also the fact that Herbert had a plot element straight out spaceballs (Jews in SPACE) was the final nail in the coffin for this one. I read this one purely out of internal obligation.   


Now I don't know if you count the herbert/anderson books, but if you do>   
7. Hunters of Dune: frustrating, poorly written, weirdly paced and ultimately directionless, relying on cheap fanservice to push the story rather than genuine need for closure. Also has an ending so generic and silly I got concerned.   


8. Sandworms of Dune: legitimately hated this book with every fiber of my being. The entire ending was clearly planned by Herbert - there are hints that this is the ultimate endgame throughout the series - but Herbert the younger and Anderson wrote it in such a way that they totally missed the point of the preceding six volumes to send a message that is totally counter to the first two books very explicit Anti-messiah message and it felt like a disneyfied ending to a very complicated series.

It's been like 20 thousand years since anyone inhabited Earth, why would anyone remember or care about some 20th century Earth figure? Yeah, yeah, ancestral memory and whatever, but it feels cheap in a ""you the reader know who this is, so I don't have to describe him"" sort of way. Paul then wanders off into the desert after being blinded.!<

*Children of Dune:* >!Sort of a weaker version of Dune, with Paul's two kids. It's the closest of the sequels to feeling like the original novel, but it's around here that Herbert starts getting his own continuity mixed up and some details start to not make sense. Alia has the genetic memory of a *male* ancestor (even for abominations, that's been established as not possible - that was the entire point of the Kwisatz Haderach and she isn't that), and Herbert mixes up Duncan Idaho's and Gurney Halleck's backstory and attributes Gurney's to Duncan. This stays wrong throughout the rest of the series and is compounded by the later ones because it's directly relevant to the plot of the last two novels. There's some weird blind street preacher that could be Paul. He seems like Paul, kind of hints at being Paul, and has abilities like Paul. Is it Paul? Eh, who cares, he gets shanked by some dude. Alia completely loses her shit because she has been taken over by the memories of Baron Harkonnen for some reason, but she bites it as well. Leto II decides fuck it, I'm going to be a worm now and wraps himself up in sandtrout because sure why not.!<

*God Emperor of Dune:* >!Now this is a weird one. It's nothing like the preceding novels, or the ones that follow. It's mostly philosophical ruminations by now-sandwormed Leto II over a couple thousand years later, Arrakis is mostly terraformed, and Leto II having a worm-boner for a perfect woman engineered to be his type (while being frustrated that his man-junk has been missing for hundreds of years due to the worm transformation). From what I have read outside of the novel, it appears that Herbert wrote this during the period when his wife was dying and he quickly remarried after her death, so Leto II is just him transferring his sexual frustrations to paper. Leto II ends up falling off a bridge into the *Idaho* River (because fuck you that's why) and he dies after the worm explodes and the sandtrout get the fuck out of dodge. So much for terraforming, the worms are back.!<

*Heretics of Dune:* >!Holy fuck what did I read. This is when things start to really go off the rails and make no fucking sense. Set 1500 years after the reign of Leto II, you get an entirely new set of characters. And Duncan fucking Idaho. Because of course you do. And guess what? He might be the next Kwisatz Haderach. Because of course he is. And if you thought the Bene Gesserit were cool and interesting in the early novels, you can give up on that here because shit just gets stupid. And say hello to the Honored Matres, the *other* sex witches. At this point Arrakis (ahem, ""Rakis"") starts to just become a footnote, and you can say goodbye to the whole damn planet by the end of the novel, but not before swiping some sandworms and the one random person (Sheeana) who can somehow talk to the damn things.!<

*Chapterhouse: Dune:* >!Picks up where the last one left off, and I guess we need a new Arrakis now, so time to totally fuck up the Bene Gesserit home planet. I guess those worms and Sheeana the wormspeaker will come in handy. Also an inordinate amount of time is given to Duncan Idaho constantly fucking a captured Honored Matre. Sheeana gets in a lot of fuck time as well. Miles Teg, the only decent character from Heretics, makes a reappearance as a ghola (clone) because of course he does, and we get introduced to *JEWS IN SPACE*, and not even in that sort of weird mixing of religions thing Herbert did with the Fremen Zensunni wanderers and whatnot. Just straight oldschool real-world Judaism 20k+ years in the future.  It feels too... mundane for Dune, and unrealistic that religious traditions would not have changed at all in twenty thousand years like every other religion we are introduced to. What relevance does their introduction have to anything? Fuck if I know. They barely play much of a role, and Herbert never got to write what was going to be the last novel so if they did have significance it does not get explored.!<",Ezekiel-Grey,2023-02-13T21:12:29Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,49

There are also aesthetic elements that make it haunting, and the contrast between the size of machines and humans (who look like ants next to the machines and armies) is a great device that tells something about how individuals are powerlessly shaped by forces of history and political forces.

111494d_71,111494d,"Yeah the first book isn’t a white savior narrative, but you need to read between the lines a little bit more than in Messiah and Children where it’s basically directly stated. 

In Dune, Jessica basically admits that the Bene Gesserit have been to Dune before to sow this “savior” narrative for Paul to fit into. Every move Jessica makes in interacting with the Fremen is calculated to fit into this prophecy that she knows the Bene Gesserit implanted in their culture. Beyond the movies, one of the other arguments for the “white savior” narrative could be that the Fremen view Paul as a savior because of this prophecy, but the book has a few lines to indicate to you that this manipulation was just set up before Paul even arrived.

You also have the fact that many Fremen die in the fight against the Sardauakar up until the end of the first book. Paul is having visions of causing destruction, not being a savior.

But the big differences is you actually see more of the fallout from this in Messiah and Children so they bring Paul’s story full circle so show his rise and fall. 

So you’re 100% correct and I agree, but Messiah and Children are great to read just to see the seeds that Frank Herbert sowed in the first book about Paul not really being the savior people think he is to come to fruition.",canne19,2023-02-13T14:05:46Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,71

111494d_74,111494d,">The Fremen don't need to be saved. They are doing just fine on their own

The book makes it abundantly clear that this is not the case, that the Fremen are being slaughtered and oppressed. The entire prophecy is about being saved from oppression and it finds fruitful ground in the society of the Fremen because they are oppressed and have not saved themselves for the last thousands of years. 

There is a reason Dune, The last Samurai and Spielbergs Avatar can be generally summarized with the exact same text. Its because they follow the same story, also called ""the white savior"" which in itself is anti-imperialist and has always been. 

You seem to be making a step in your logic that is incorrect. 

""Man from oppressing Society finds himself in the care of the oppressed, learns the merit of their ways, begins to live and succeed in their society, fucks the chieftains daughter, and then helps them defeat his former home society usually by combining knowledge and technology from both worlds.""

Thats the white savior in a nutshell, and there are a couple of things you seem to imply which are niot necessarily true. As in the oppressed don't have to be complete savages, but its completely normal for them better attuned to their environment than the oppressors. Also being depicted as somewhat Noble against the debauchery of the opposition is usual. It does not automatically agree with the white mans burden. And is basically always anti-colonialist. 

The white Savior is just a set of Tropes and Plot Points - not a question of Quality or Opinion the text must espouse. Just like a Detective Drama starts with a crime, early investigation, a false lead in the middle, a race to time at the end and then a reveal at the end. Even if it turns out that the Detective was the murderer all along, its still a Detective Story. As is Dune a white savior story, even if it turns out that he's a test tube baby following a false prophecy and his saving will ultimately, but after the first book ends, end in a lot of misery for a lot of people, but not the fremen who he saved from the oppression of the Harkonnen. 

And that is by design, because the Author picked a story-structure he knew most of his audience would be easily familiar with so that he could write around those common tropes without immediately alienating everyone.",Daihatschi,2023-02-13T19:26:08Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,74

111494d_81,111494d,"""The white savior is a cinematic trope in which a white central character rescues non-white (often less prominent) characters from unfortunate circumstances.""
-Wikipedia

Avatar? Yes, I agree with you that it's definitely a white savior narrative. No question.

The Last Samurai? Partially, though Tom Cruise doesn't save the samurai. He witnesses their final defeat. The movie is about the tragedy of a lost way of life, not about saving it. I will grant that it has ""white savior"" elements, though.

However, I *strongly* disagree that Dune is a white savior narrative. A surface reading suggests similar plot points to the white savior narrative, but a full reading indicates that Herbert uses the surface tropes of the white savior narrative to create expectations in the reader and then undermine them. 

1. I already mentioned that the author pointedly reveals that the Bene Gesserit planted the white savior narrative as part of their cynical political machinations. You say the ""prophesy"" is about saving the Fremen, but that's literally the Bene Gesserit's planted story. Herbert is showing the contrast between what something appears to be on the surface versus what it really is. He's literally telling you that the white savior narrative it seems like he is starting is not at all the true story.

2. While Paul's visions are confusing, they reveal that he may be leading the Fremen away from their traditional society and values and on to a murderous galactic jihad with people like Stilgar becoming mere instruments of oppression. This is portrayed as horrific. 

3. The Fremen ARE doing well on their own and value their independence. Yes, the city people are oppressed by the Harrkonens, and the sietch Fremen have to fight the Harrkonens from time to time, but the Harrkonens underestimate them. They have no idea how many sietch Fremen there are, that they can ride sandworms, and that they have a tremendous amount of water saved up. The off-worlders are confined to just a fraction of Arrakis and rarely stray into the deep desert. Not only that, but the Fremen are sophisticated enough to secretly pay the Spacing Guild to prevent anyone from spying on them from space, thereby concealing their true numbers, their movements, and their ability to control sandworms.

I understand why a shallow reading of Dune may lead some to think it is a white savior narrative, but I hope I have convinced you that it is the opposite.",sailing_by_the_lee,2023-02-13T20:30:18Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,81

111494d_84,111494d,"Tbh I’ve met or heard about a few people who read the first Dune and still viewed it more of a typical “Hero’s journey” story. They might view it as more “reluctant savior” but they still think his ultimate actions bring a net positive because the emperor and Harkonens are gone so they still view him as a savior because they don’t know what Paul’s empire is like. (Of course, many of these people might not be as avid readers as the people on r/books who typically search for underlying themes but the point still stands many people view the main plot as overthrowing an evil emperor because that is what drives the plot in the first book.)

I also think the only part about the next two that really make it heavy handed is that in general later down the series, Frank Herbert likes to have his characters directly discuss philosophy, religion, politics etc so in those discussions it’s heavy handed because they’re basically lecturing at each other. I would argue that this is what people dislike about the later books more so than plot elements being heavy handed. It’s a bit “tell don’t show.”

I don’t think showing the fall out from Paul’s actions and Fremen culture being destroyed is heavy handed. Maybe a little bit, but I always viewed Paul’s story as meant to parallel the Aristotelian concept of a tragic hero so without seeing his downfall, the story feels kind of incomplete.

111494d_85,111494d,"Even if the Detective ends up being the bad guy, the story is a detective story. 

Even if the savior ends up being the bad guy, the story is still a savior story. 

Flipping a Story Beat on its head - as literally an unexpected twist for the reader - is still using the Story Beat. 

Tom Cruise doesn't literally save all the Samurai's lives, but he helps them go down in glory, makes the emperor cry and changes his heart. That's still the same beat, but with flourishes around it. To create something unique out of a known formula. Like most stories do. 

Frank Herbert uses the white savior narrative for his plot, and then changes the lore around these common tropes to say something interesting about the tropes. 

That's not a shallow read. Dune is a white savior narrative criticising white savior narratives. 

And it must be, or it wouldn't be able to make its point. 

Somehow you jump to the conclusion that its impossible to comment on the genre while portraying that genre. 

**I am not saying the critique isn't there. I am saying Dune criticises from within the genre and has to, or else it would ring entirely hollow.** 

>He's literally telling you that the white savior narrative it seems like he is starting is not at all the true story.

So he creates an expectation in the reader, based on the readers knowledge of common white savior tropes and then subverts them. But subverting is still using. 

>The Fremen ARE doing well on their own and value their independence.

As are the Samurai in their small village and the blue people in Avatar. And the generals in The Last Samurai believe it'll be super easy to smoke them out because they have gunpowders and those savages only bows. The oppressor is always wrong about their assumptions, only this way the protagonist can learn the error of their previous ways. That just IS the trope. 

And also, the entirety of the plot hinges on the fact that the fremen are desperate enough all of the support and power, which he later fails to properly control. A happy, non-oppressed society doesn't do that. 

The whole point of Lawrence of Arabia, is that he starts by telling the locals ""You silly people and your primitive ways"" (when his guide is shot over a water dispute) and then learns over the story how utterly wrong he was. And he, too, wouldn't have been able to survive without their help. 

I don't understand how your third point is an argument for anything. You are literally describing how the trope goes on all other white savior narratives as well.",Daihatschi,2023-02-14T13:41:03Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,85

No.

xa1r9g_5,xa1r9g,"A few things :
- If you're are a peraon who doesn't mind watching the movie version of the book then watch dune. The movie only adapts about 300 pages of the books so you'd still have alot to read to complete the novel, also the book version of the events are far far more detailed than in the movie. However, it will give you a basic understanding of the plot and world of dune.

- if you want to not watch the movie then a helpful tip is to listen to the audiobook while your reading (mainly for the pronouncation of the names and places)

- Another thing that might help is Reading Dune Podcast on YouTube or wherever. Two guys one who hasn't read any dune book the other is an avid fan discus chapter by chapter. They're great for comprehending the first half of the novel, if you don't want to do any major googling.

Alot of people will just tell you to read through it and it will be explained later, but it doesn't help when you don't like being confused so i found these stuff to help me. It really is a great story although the sequels are incomparable to dune book 1. They're so good.

Dune is definitely tough because it just dumps you in & you learn as you go through context clues. You could try watching the movie?

xa1r9g_14,xa1r9g,"Don't worry about not understanding. Dune has A LOT of layers and even after a third reading you'd still be discovering layers, hints, links, plots and foreshadowing. At the risk of sounding elitist, Dune is a lot more complex and has a lot more going on than the average modern book, or at least it seems so from what I've been reading since reading Dune. 

It also doesn't help that Frank Herbert is cramming so much information in so little text. You'll have passages that hint at five or more very different, nuanced, but important details of the world and/or story that you don't even realize at the time, only to plant seeds as you go along and slowly grow with your understanding of the world grows as you progress through the books. 

It also covers some very heavy topics like religion, propaganda, education, family, duty, justice (or the illusion thereof), ecology, and so much more. I may be biased because this book was a formative experience for me, allowing me to understand religion in my teen years and helping me come to terms with my position as an atheist in a Christian environment, but this book is more than just a ""boy gets revenge for his father's murder"" plot. 

My advice is: make peace with the thought that you probably won't understand it, but try to open your mind and explore the details as you go through the experience of reading it. I highly recommend reading the subsequent 5 books in the series and then returning to the first one and re-reading it after a while with the familiarity you then have of Frank Herbert's writing style and philosophy. It should make much more sense then. That doesn't mean this is the kind of book that only gets good later or after re-reading it, it is already good, it only gets better after re-reading.",dragonatorul,2022-09-09T20:49:10Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,14

If it’s too much, you could always try again in a year or two. 

There’s a lot of more accessible SciFi out there that you can read next. 

- The Ender’s game series is how I got started. {Ender’s Game} is the first in that series. 
- John Scalzi has a ton ({Old Man’s War} is probably his best)
- {The Saturn Run} is a great standalone SciFi set in the near future. 
- {The Martian} or {Project Hail Mary} are excellent as well, although Project Hail gets pretty heavy into science which I personally liked but might not be for everyone. 
- {Starship Troopers} and {The Forever War} are excellent SciFi war novels (one glorifying war and the other is more anti war). 

There’s probably a ton more out there but this is a good start. Read a few more and then revisit Dune and I think it will be a lot easier to read.",Candid-Mark-606,2022-09-10T00:12:16Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,21

edit - jeez louis - I just realized I made a wall of text  if you want more I can do more, but check this out for defining the funny names. Also, it's in no particular order, I'm just barfing out things as I remember them  


Kwisatz Hadarach - ""the prophecy one"" A superhuman being resulting from \~100 generations of selective breeding by the Bene Gesserit (Paul Atreides)

Bene Gesserit - A group of women who work in the shadows, marry important men (planetary rulers) and possess somewhat superhuman abilities trained into them from a young age (some have sort of telepathy, and they use the voice to temporarily control others. (Jessica Atreides \[Paul's mom\], reverend mother Gaius Helen Mohaim)

Maud-dib - Paul's nickname among the Fremen

laison al gaib - the prophecy one, but in the fremen language - the bene gesserit planted the seed of this prophecy among the fremen before the events of dune

Fremen - native non-city dwelling population of Arrakis

Arrakis - desert planet where spice ""melange"" comes from

Caladan - earth like planet where Atreides were governing before the events of dune

Salusa Secondus - The emperors prison planet, where the emperors super soldiers (Sardaukar) come from

Giede Prime - Harkonnen's home planet

melange - ""the spice"" a drug that gives the universe pretty much everything. It allows the guild navigators to fold space (faster than light travel), it allows Paul to see the future, it extends life spans for humans, 

The guild - a group that has a monopoly on space travel, their navigators are hopped up on spice and can fold space

The emperor - the man that controls all the houses (the emperor is house corrino, I think, and the only other two houses that are important are Atreides \[good guys\] and Harkonnen \[bad guys\])

HArkonen - Baron Vladimir Harkonnen - the main antagonist (the floating fat man)

\- The beast raban - The Baron's nephew, who ran the spice mining operations                           on arrakis immediately prior to the events of dune

\- Piter DeVries - The Harkonnens mentat (advisor)

\- Feyd Rautha - A younger nephew that the Baron hopes will succeed him (he was also a part of the kwisatz hadarach chain - similar to Paul)

Atreides - The Duke Leto - Paul's dad

\- Lady Jessica - Pauls mom, also a member of the bene gesserit

\- Thufir Hawat - Attreides mentat

\- Duncan Idaho - Master at arms or something similar for house atreides

\- Gurney Halleck - Something like duncan idaho - trains paul in swordplay and plays a musical instrument that I dont' remember the name of. (played by motherfuckin Patrick Stewart - holds a pug and sword and charges into battle - at least in the Lynch version)

\- Dr. Yueh - Atriedes royal doctor

\- Shadout Mapes - a fremen housekeeper for the attreides in their new planet

Corrino - The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV - another sort of antagonist

\- princess Irulan - emperor's daughter

\- reverend mother gaius helen mohaim - The emperor's truthteller and a bene gesserit

\- Liet Kynes - the emperors planetologist studying arrakis

Fremen - Stilgar - leader of the fremen at whatever sietch paul ends up at

\- Chani - (I think stilgar's daughter) and some chick that Paul lusts after

\- I Think there is some other significant ones but I can't remember any names, there is a fremen bene gesserit reverend mother, maybe

House - family that controls an entire planet, they are linked together through the empire, and swear fealty to the emperor

Laandsrad - That is the name of the group of houses (kind of like the American senate if each state was a house)

CHOAM - A company that (I think organizes spice shipments) that is kind of like a cartel - I always thought of it like OPEC.

Mentat - human computer - actual computers have been outlawed since something called the butlerian jihad millenia before the events of dune.  

IX - pronouced ""icks"" - a planet with a civilization that produces machines used throughout the empire

sietch - a place where the fremen shelter and make home out in the desert (I think this is usually a cave in a rocky outcropping in the desert)

stilsuit - an outfit that is worn in the desert so that your body's moisture doesn't escape into the air and filters it (so you can drink your pee and sweat)

ornithopter - like a helicopter but with flapping wings

harvester - tank like machine that harvest spice from the desert sands",lazyfacejerk,2022-09-10T00:21:54Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,22

xa1r9g_30,xa1r9g,"Dune has a lot of layers. It might be worth googling what all the groups are so you understand them because the different factions are as important as the house players. I will probably mess some things up. But Mentats are super smart human computers and tacticians that plan for whatever house they are assigned to. Bene Gessey?  I always forget how to spell that are science witches that have infused the galaxy with an almost false religion that is a shroud of science as well. They are trying to create perfect Heirs to rule the kingdom. They are all women because if I understood men really can’t be trusted with that power. Freemen are a ruthless group of indigenous people who live on dune with their own culture. The doctors are trained by kingdom to serve without question and be 100% loyal. Everything is kingdom based and power based with everyone jockeying for influence and more power. But playing within certain rules. House Artrades basically comes to Dune and want to shake things up by breaking some of the previous caste systems and elitism that rules the world. You are mostly right fat dude wants to kill Paul’s dad but mostly so he can absorb his power and influence. The I am not trying to spoil anything so I am trying to keep to where you are in the story. The bene women have created a prophecy that an outsider would come and basically be their savior. So that religion is big on dune. There are other parts like secret communication techniques that families use to talk to each other. Mental control that each person uses to arrive at personal mastery. A lot of the book is about mastery of self, mastery of others, mastery of nature but not being able to master the future despite all this mastery. At least that is my hot take.

The problem is not that Herbert dumps the reader into a universe without too much, if any exposition. Many SF and fantasy authors to and have done that, and it's fine. The problem is that the whole thing simply doesn't work. The villains do not have any traits apart from being evil (note the frequent ""hahaha I'm so evil"" quotes coming directly from them), the main character has zero personality apart from having the whole ""redeemer"" role thrust onto him, and none of the motivations and actions of the characters are even remotely believable. All that is compounded by the unbelievable ""science"", committing the sin of ""calling a rabbit a smeerp"" twenty times per page, and the fact that Herbert is simply not a good sentence-by-sentence writer and the prose is just bad. So while I do like the concept of Dune (desert planet, worms, power struggles), I do not enjoy the actual books.

Most people who thought it was difficult to read talk about not knowing the terms used in the book. They expect there to be exposition right away, while I've been(and still am) fine with things being explained later.

I think this is the part that is making it hard for you.  Herbert uses words that are very similar to real words, but are made up for his universe.  

For example, *Kwisatz Haderach* and *Mentat* and *Bene Gesserit* and *gom jabbar* are all made up words, but it might be hard to tell if they are just English words that you forgot.  *Baliset* is the word for a made up space guitar that definitely seems like it could be an English word. *Hunter-seeker* is a made up word for a device that kills people, but both hunter and seeker are English words.  *Carryall* is another example of an English word that is used, but in Dune it means a kind of aircraft that can pick up and carry spice harvesting machines.

I agree with others that things might be more clear if you first check the Dune glossary before you look up a word in an online dictionary.

xa1r9g_75,xa1r9g,"Different redditor, but I absolutely loved all six of the Frank Herbert set.  Thinking back, and reading the discussions that keep coming up about them, I think some of it boils down to what kinds of things do you enjoy in a story.  I am an absolute fiend for worldbuilding, and Dune delivers in spades there so that alone had me hooked.  Add in that Dune was exploring some ideas that I hadn't seen in much depth and at an age where they were becoming interesting to me and they become kinda formative.  

I suspect the actual advice is that the first two books are a single story.  Dune isn't much of an ending so much as a point where the story changes direction and Messiah more of a stopping point.  (none of them strictly 'end' it's definitely the kind of stories where the world continues beyond the pages) Then you have the two books about the next generation which are very much another set and really should be completed as a pair.  Heretics and Chapterhouse are again connected to each other but much less tightly.

I think it ultimately works for Dune because so much of the storytelling occurs inside characters heads and their subtle observations (and the way their subtle observations play off each other) that it would be impossible to write it effectively in a Game of Thrones style for example, where the author is switching between established viewpoints and exploring their biases and experiences separate from other elements of the story, but it definitely takes some getting used to.",Betteroni,2022-10-02T09:30:14Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,78

Dune has a companion book, but it's a little easier to tell what the terms mean by context.

Even if you don't agree with all of Jodorosky's ideas for how the Dune universe would look, you get the sense of the wide reach of HIS vision, and the much wider reach of Herbert's vision, too.

iv1gxf_35,iv1gxf,"Dune has some of the most remarkable characters and character moments.  They sneak up on you, you’re with the characters for a while and don’t think much of it until they do something or something happens to them that SHATTERS them.  And sometimes it’s willingly.  In those moments you really feel the hard edge of their world, and the determination in their intent.

The first Dune book can easily be read standalone, and you’ll know enough Dune to know what Dune is.

But since you seem to be enjoying it, read the second and third books as well.  (The second will slow at times, it’s more intent on wrestling with the consequences of the first book and its characters than with serving up action per se, but it will also punch you with a few of those “WHOA” moments I mentioned.)

And then at the end of the third, you’ll probably want to know the consequences and read the fourth (God Emperor of Dune) as well if you’ve enjoyed it this far...

The rest you can probably leave alone unless you’re just an unrepentant Dune Nerd by then, but if so by all means enjoy the really weird stuff!",RandomWyrd,2020-09-18T20:28:18Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,35

I feel like this is a common experience. The book throws you into a vast universe of lore with little explanation. If you're lucky, you have a glossary or even the Dune encyclopedia at hand to get through it all. It can be overwhelming!

I also think many have an easier time with the 2nd half of the book than the 1st. The first time I read Dune, I was trying to get back into reading generally. My reading speed slowly ramped up as I progressed through the book, and I think part of that is due to the density of the book's ideas.

jbrmj7_20,jbrmj7,"I want to love Dune but I have a hard time reconciling some very heavy misogynistic overtones in the novel. Every character has such depth except for the female ones and honestly it’s frustrating to read as a result. I enjoy the universe and I like the rich tapestry of characters and their stories, but the disparity in depth between the sexes makes this novel very dated to me. The last line is a perfect example of what I mean. 

It’s a shame too because the writing style is fantastic. I only wish that the attention to detail and a sense of ambition was put into those characters.",PolywogowyloP,2020-10-15T22:06:55Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,20
jbrmj7_21,jbrmj7,"I think ""Dune"" is pretty good. If Herbert had stopped after ""Dune"", it would be even more highly regarded than it is now. Unfortunately, the later books get progressively worse, but he was clearly hooked on the money the sequels generated and just went on churning them out. By the time you get to ""Chapterhouse: Dune"" you're just praying for the boredom and the ever-thinner plotlines to be over.

(Obviously it doesn't end there: Herbert's son spotted the money-tree his father had left him and enlisted the world's worst SF writer to help him shake it. Like most people, I don't believe the story about Frank Herbert leaving notes, because (like everyone except Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson) I haven't actually seen them. (It's almost as if they don't exist!) Anyway, these later books are utter drivel, and badly-written to boot.)",TelescopiumHerscheli,2020-10-15T21:47:48Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,21

jbrmj7_33,jbrmj7,"My feelings on Dune are mixed. There are some interesting things that I really like in it. The world-building is cool. Having Paul be a deconstruction of the Hero's Journey is interesting.

As far as characters go, most of them came off pretty bland. Paul, like I said, is interesting in concept - a hero who's powers are kind of a curse and who will inevitably cause terrible atrocities - but he himself isn't that interesting. Everything comes fairly easy to him and even his thoughts about his role in the coming Jihad come off as really detached and almost academic. A lot of the side characters could have been interesting, but ultimately don't have much to do in the book.

And then there's Chani. Chani must be one of the most boring characters I've ever read. Her main defining character trait seems to be being Paul's love interest. Not only are we given no reason to like her individually, we're given no reason to be invested in her relationship with Paul. Their relationship develops almost entirely in a timeskip. IIRC, we literally go from them meeting each other to them already having a kid together (A kid btw who is introduced offscreen and killed all over the course of a chapter. I'm not sure if readers are supposed to care that this happened, but I'm not sure how any reader could). Being unable to invest in Chani in any way is less of a problem in the first book than it is for the second book, where the entire plot revolves around people trying to kill her.

I know that the political intrigue isn't really the type of story that Herbert is trying to tell in Dune, but it just falls flat. There are so many plans that either just work immediately or are completely dropped. Thufir Hawat spends a few chapters plotting against the Harkonens, but literally nothing ever comes of this. Gurney Halleck is a smuggler, but nothing that he does matters either. The Harkonen plot to defeat Duke Leto just works. No real kinks. No need to adjust the plan. No real counterstrokes by Duke Leto. Same for Paul's plan to retake the city. Everything goes according to plan. The book spends a lot of time building up the emperor as this mysterious powerful figure, but then he's beaten with little no difficulty.

There's a lot about the book to enjoy, but some of the weaker points just really irked me while reading.",BernankesBeard,2020-10-15T22:39:57Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,33

So I took out Dune, one of the old early reprints without a revealing cover. I’d already passed over it before because the copy was yellowed and old but decided to give it a shot. 

The interspersed arabic words and phrases threw me off. I also had to double back here and there to fully understand the subtleties and nuances being conveyed. It was most definitely philosophical and atmospheric, requiring of my full attention. This meant that it was a bit of a slog getting through it at first.

jbrmj7_46,jbrmj7,"I was so excited to read dune this year before the movie. I really, really struggled with it. 

I found the book to be, generally, just very confusing. I thought the world and the landscapes and the creatures were amazing, but the characters and their development felt really random and haphazard to me the entire time I was reading. 

It was difficult to track with / follow / understand pauls development. The dreams didn’t feel like they were culminating into anything. The coming ‘jihad’ just sort amounted to a battle. I dunno it all felt a bit flat to me. 

I watched David Lynch’s DUNE immediately after and although I felt the movie was generally terrible as well it actually helped me understand more clearly some of the storylines and arcs in the book. Also some of the characters - like the baron - took on a more wild and crazy persona which was exciting. 

I’m still really excited for Dennis’s Version (my favorite director by a long shot) and hoping he can bring that world to life for me even more. Might give it a re read after that and hopefully see what I missed out on the first time around!",DFMO,2020-10-16T01:24:53Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,46

In a similar way that god emperor bolstered my opinion of children. Seeing what each was working towards and experiencing them for the second time when you know what the prescient visions mean, and what terrible consequence is, etc..

But purely mechanically, his writing is hard to read. It's the same for all his books, great ideas, mediocre ability to put those ideas on a page in a way that is easy and engaging to read. IMO, his best work is when that sense of bewilderment at what is actually going on meshes perfectly with the tone that the book is trying to set (see Whipping Star and the Dosadi Experiment, where the lack of understanding is largely shared by the protagonist).

I see it a bit like Star Wars and George Lucas. Amazing series for many of the same reasons as Dune, but we all still agree that Lucas can't write plausible dialogue to save his own life.

Oof, disagree.

The entire plot of the series (as far as I've read) rests on the conflict between Paul being *fated* (for lack of a better word) to be the ""chosen one"" and him having to find ways to sort of undo that. It's not just that he doesn't want it, which is a trope in itself, but that he feels he absolutely needs to avoid it, but avoiding it would also cause problems.

Paul is in a real catch-22, and the conflict of the story only exists because he is the ""chosen one"". I don't think I know of another ""chosen one"" story like Dune in this respect, and reducing it to *just* ""it's a chosen-one story"" is unhelpful, in my opinion.",DonaldPShimoda,2020-10-15T22:26:44Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,129

That's almost all 3 does. Anyways, I just finished 3 and picked up 4... pretty sure I'm gonna stop there since, in spite of me loving the first 2, 3 felt like a chore to finish reading.

y4zzsn_87,y4zzsn,"I kind of understand your point of view but the analogy to Monte Cristo doesn't really work for me.

That book was mainly about the story and how the circumstances influence the main character. 
In Dune it's more about ideas and philosophies Herbert was interested in wrapped in a story that serves as a device through which those ideas can be explored. Since a lot of those ideas are fairly deep and there is a quite many of them in the first book they are often only hinted at and cannot be put under a microscope because you are also introduced to all the characters and locations at the same time. Therefore the first book works better as a story. The rest of the books are not chained by that because you already know many characters and locations so it delves more deeply into the themes and ideas.

So in my eyes the misconception about the sequel lies mostly with the readers because Herbert seemed to know what he wanted to do exactly and if it's not your cup of tea than there is no reason to go through all the books. Just enjoy the first one which was sort of a side product almost but ended up being the best one - being well balanced with the story while offering many interesting themes, ideas and tendencies about bott the past as well as the future you can think about while not being overwhelmed by exploring them in too much detail.",set4bet,2022-10-16T15:24:33Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,87

12sqot_1,12sqot,"Dune tied for my second favorite series of all time and I got into it in ninth grade: perfect timing to really associate heavily with the main character while reading.

If anyone cares, it's tied with Stephen King's ""*Dark Tower*"" series for me in level of awesomeness. Rounding out the 4th and 5th positions would be Tolkien and Terry Pratchett. Not sure about the order there, I'm just getting into the Discworld series and it's pretty effing wonderful (and JEEBUS there are a lot of books).

My number one favorite Fiction series so far is the ""*Prince of Nothing*"" series by R. Scott Bakker. [Book One - *the darkness that comes before*](http://www.amazon.com/Darkness-That-Comes-Before-Nothing/dp/1841494089). The way the author describes magic is probably the coolest I've ever read and the closest to what I've imagined. That plus the detailed battle scenes, the tides of political and religious influences in clashing nations, and great character development.

*2 minute later edit* - In reading the wikipedia page for the prince of nothing series I just found this tidbit that made me laugh after writing that list out:

> Bakker has mentioned that this series was primarily influenced by the works of Tolkien and Frank Herbert.

12sqot_11,12sqot,"I read it recently as an adult and hated it. In fact, let me dig up what I wrote when I finished it, two years ago. Here it is:

------------
I just finished reading Dune today. Man, that book sucked.

On page 5 or so, there's a sentence ""But could he really be the one?"" When you see such a sentence so early in the book, you just know it's not going well. 

...it's so awfully written. The characters are so incredibly flat and cartoonish. The action moves by jerks and spasms. Nothing is believable, everything is wooden. Most characters have a ""thing"" that follows them everywhere; if this guy's in a scene, the ""inkvine scar on his jaw"" will ""ripple"". So freaking bored with this rippling scar, sheesh.

But the worst thing is, Herbert can't manage information to save his life. Everyone learns facts by staring into space and having an important epiphany - everyone, not just the main character the prophet. Right at the beginning of the book, there's a scene where the main bad guy talks to his henchman and nephew and carefully explains to the reader everything about the upcoming intrigue. This is done under the guise of explaining it to the nephew, and is as artless and stupid way to infodump plot on the reader as I've seen in a long while.

The hero's mind is frequently filled with his _terrible purpose_. He doesn't know what the terrible purpose is, but he sure can feel when something important's happening. Someone says something that's kind of a clue to what the hell's going on, but what if the stupid reader misses the clue? Wait, I know, Paul will feel a tugging of his _terrible purpose_ at hearing those words. Pretty convenient, that. 

The main bad guy is the master of intrigue and deception, holds the planet for 80 years, knows everything about everyone, but somehow believes until the end of the book that the Fremen are a tiny bunch of inconsequential rag-men - even though they're unbelievably hardened killers that have been killing his people by the thousands constantly, always taking at least 3 enemies for every one of their own. Again, can't manage information.

Gah, I just can't believe how awful that book turned out to be.",anatoly,2012-11-08T01:07:21Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,11

But I always have to suspend a little disbelief (for lack of a better term) because so much of it lives within a world of ""good and evil"" which to me doesn't reflect the complicated condition of our world.

The beauty of Dune isn't in how it imagined the universe, but how it imagined people's evolution within it.  If there's one thing that Dune taught me (admittedly as a teenager) it's that even the omniscient are blinded by their personal realities.  

The greatest thinkers in the world are those who see both in the singular and collective.  Who realize that the world can have rules without being locked down by them.  More importantly, prescience and power do not equal the whole of truth of reality, only the part that you desire.  ",Kangrave,2012-11-07T22:53:05Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,18
12sqot_19,12sqot,"If you want me to be specific...

""Could he really be the one?""- There is a prophesy, he could be the prophesied one. This is relevant information.

The characters are anything but ""flat and cartoonish""- Every character has a unique backstory and they learn and adapt to the situations they encounter, or they die.  Gurney Halleck is a badass, you should feel honored to hear so much about his rippling scar (the story of how he got it is pretty good too).

Considering the fact that the Harkonnen plot to remove the Atreides was decades in the planning and he had just brought his young nephew in on it, a little explanation may have been in order.

The inner monologue is pretty thick in the Dune books, this also tells you how heavily decisions weigh on their makers minds.

Baron Harkonnen is not a master of intrigue or deception, he's a tool being used by the Emperor.  But even if he were he still couldn't have infiltrated the Fremen communities; they are too insular.  And the Fremen weren't killing Harkonnens men by the thousands, not until the Jihad started.",h3rp3r,2012-11-08T02:45:41Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,19
12sqot_20,12sqot,"At the risk of incurring the wrath of Dune-lovers, here you go.

The simplest way of explaining why I hated Dune is to say that Frank Herbert doesn't know what his strengths are.  Dune's greatest achievement is its universe, particularly the planet itself - expansive, mysterious, dangerous.  The most exciting through-line is the ecology of the planet, the most exciting passages unveil pieces of the mystery of the sandworms.  Herbert, however, treats this world only as a backdrop for what he thought was a taught political thriller.  He spends astonishingly little time on the worms and spends a huge chunk of the book endlessly rehashing Bene Gesserit prophecies, clan family interactions, and Paul's growing Messiah-hood.  

All that political intrigue could have been interesting, except his characters have so little dimension - Leto Atreides is good, oh-so-good (Damn the profits, save those men!) and the Baron is bad, oh-so-bad (Bring me more drugged slave-boys to rape!).  It's deeply irritating to have character so good he's Messianic and Herbert knows this, but his solution (Paul can't help it!  It's prophecy!) is hollow and self-serving.  The result is endless talking, talking, talking about prophecy and power, when there are these **huge goddamn worms** that no one has explained yet, why can't we see more of those?   I have a hunch he explains more about the ecology of the planet in the future books, and I think the worm passages stick in your mind, so I think the memories of those who loved this (these) book(s) as a teenager are a bit distorted.  You may remember the action and mystery being there, but the ratio of action and mystery to political droning is way, way off.

Also not among Herbert's strengths are poetry, phrasing, and dialogue.  The poetry and songs are trite, and the axioms have no ring to them.  At one point, Lady Jessica says something like ""We have a Bene Gesserit saying..."" and proceeds to rattle off a paragraph of un-rememberable gibberish.  It's a far cry from creating a real axiom in fiction, like Tolkien's ""Not all who wander are lost"".  And did you notice nearly all the characters speak the exact same way - in wordy, overly formal sentences?  In good dialogue, characters should use totally different voices, even if conveying similar information.  I bet you'd have an impossible time identifying unattributed speech by Paul or Lady Jessica or even the Baron out of context.  Unless the speech said ""Woe is me, it's so hard being the Messiah"" or ""bring me more boys to rape!"", of course.

He's a pawn, and he's only revealing a sub-plot. As to the revelations, it's not a plot device, it's the point of the books. They're about the evolution of the human intellect and involves extremes of mental computation. For instance, Paul's prescience is often called magic or fantasy, and while it is fairly absurd it works within the rules Dune lays out. Paul isn't magic, he is a perfect human computer capable of calculating probability to extraordinary lengths. He's a combination of the Sisterhood's breeding program and the Mentat training program. Most of the main characters share this ability to some length as they've all been part of the breeding program meant to bring this about. Once again, this isn't plot device, it's the point of the books. ",Lampmonster1,2012-11-08T02:59:29Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,25

12sqot_28,12sqot,"As did I.  And it is clear here as to why.  
  
I do not particularly like dialogue or characters or character development. I strongly prefer to read a Wikipedia plot synopsis that removes all these things.  
  
What I like are BIG ideas.  Book 4 has the biggest idea I've ever read in fiction.  ""Is humanity doomed?  Is there anything we can do to stave off our extinction?  What would it take to actually cause us to survive as a species?""  
  
Dune 4 considers that our will to live is too weak, and that all our history has trained us to fail and collapse.  The protagonist of book 4 is semi-immortal and can see every possible future.  Seeing this fact about humanity he sees the only path to our survival.  To induce such a horrific trauma on humanity, one that is SO bad that our reaction to it comes to define us as a species, for forever.  Like a child who was overly controlled by parents and so is eager to move out of their house, Herbert envisions a way to save humanity that is unlike any salvation I'd before imagined.  
  
The God Emperor of Dune creates a perfect universal societal system, with little/no problems for anyone.  Thus no one has anything to solve, no way to be creative or empowered, no way to be in control, he squashes all uprisings or desire to vent or act out.  It it insufferable, unbearable, and yet ALL of humanity must suffer it for countless generations.  This is the single worst thing to happen to humanity ever.  It rankles everyone to the core of their being.  So when the God-emperor finally dies, everyone realizes that they are free - free but now subject to each other - and the idea of ever being dominated by an ""other"" again is SO terrifying, and freedom is held as being unimaginably precious, that EVERYONE wants nothing but to fly off in every direction and get as far away as possible.  Ultimately this means that even if the vast majority of humans die off, somewhere out there will be others.  Our race will survive.  
  
Man, I don't care how wooden the dialogue is.  I love ideas like these.  Herbert made this concept so alive and vivid for me that it still dances in my imagination.",mahdroo,2012-11-16T19:01:45Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,28

The one thing which has helped me throughout my life ever since I started reading the basic trilogy back in the 1970ies is the Bene Gesserit ""Litany against fear"". I have memorized it and it has helped me, I mean REALLY helped me, in many extreme circumstances in my life. 

It is a wonderful invention of fiction which has made the crossover into real life and as a philosophical anchor offers something beyond just literature. It is a huge improvement over what every other faith out there can bring to the table. It works by not relying on some imaginary deity (or even son of-) or group of deïties but on ones own strength and resolve and on the importance of keeping a clear mind no matter what.

The last time I used the Litany over and over again was some 3+ years ago when my son died at 22 years of age and panic was peeking around every corner in my life. The Litany kept me sane.

nu62gk_5,nu62gk,"Dune is still my favorite novel of all time, and the first time I read it was in High School.  It's a landmark achievement in world building, right up there with LotR in my opinion.   I was listening to a podcast about it one day, and someone said that it was dry.  Maybe that's true, but there's something about the slow, thoughtful burn of Dune that has stayed with me for years.

The fact that there are so few actions scenes, but can still grip me by the strength of the worldbuilding, characters and scope is a testament to how well written it is.  I think there's a good lesson to be learned there for fiction writers.  You can tell a good story without relying on gimmicks, sensationalism or shock value.  

Dune still manages to be pretty edgy, especially what it leaves up to the imagination.  I don't know you could publish Dune today if it left in some of the elements between Feyd and the Baron for instance.",,2021-06-07T10:22:58Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,5

I've read that his work is set out as an allegory of the Middle East under British (Harkonnen) and American (Atreides), but it's pretty clear that the real world is left behind as Herbert's imagination and world-building creates a fabric of a universe culturally familiar to our own, but technologically and politically very different.

After *Dune* comes *Dune Messiah,* then *Children of Dune.*

Frank Herbert finished three more books in the series, and after he passed away, his son and Anderson wrote the other books based on notes found ten years later.

I'm old enough that I read *Dune* and *Dune Messiah* a few years after they were first published, and *Children of Dune* when it was published--I was looking for more by Herbert by then. It was a long wait for *God Emperor of Dune* IIRC; after that I'd moved on to other series and didn't keep up with the rest of the stories.

I was pretty satisfied with those four, to be honest. The scope of the story is vast. 

It's nice that for new readers, all those books that flesh out the story are available to read at their own pace.

That does require a specific kind of buy-in that not everyone will give it, nor would they all enjoy it if they did, but if you do it really changes the work.  You probably won't enjoy the sequels unless / until the original clicks for you and you happen to like what it's doing.  The books actually get more wordy and dense, if anything.

If a kid picks up a book that has more than 5 words she doesn't understand on the first page, that book is too hard and she should choose a different one.

He's not using the culture, he's speaking up for it, from a relative position of privilege, and he did it fifty years ago.

8pyjt8_9,8pyjt8,"For me, book 1, 3, 5 were what rly kept me going throughout the series, whereas in between were relatively.. okay. But yes, Dune is an extraordinary piece of literature for sure. Love, love, love its quotes. So many good quotes. Some of my fave quotes from the books:

>”I’m a figurehead. When godhead’s given, that’s the one thing the so-called god no longer controls.” - Paul Maud’Dib


>”Good government never depends upon laws, but upon the personal qualities of those who govern. The machinery government is always subordinate to the will of those who administer that machinery. The most important element of government, therefore, is the method of choosing leaders.” - Law and Governance; The Spacing Guild Manual


>”This is the age of the shrug. He knows I’ve heard all the stories about him and he doesn’t care. Our civilization could well die of indifference within it before succumbing to external attack.” - Lady Jessica


>""The child who refuses to travel in the father's harness, this is the symbol of man's most unique capability. 'I do not have to be what my father was. I do not have to obey my father's rules or even believe everything he believed. It is my strength as a human that I can make my own choices of what to believe and what not to believe, of what to be and what not to be.'"" - Leto Atreides II, The Harg al-Ada Biography

8pyjt8_10,8pyjt8,"The second arc (children of dune / god emperor) is my favorite. Definitely keep reading! There is less going on but it’s a lot deeper, emotional, philosophical. By the time you’re done with the entire series you’ll miss the old muad dib days and you’ll want to read it again, and you will. Each time I read it I get something new out of it, or interpret it in a different way. When I was a kid I used to love the god like status of Paul, the awesome worms and fight scenes, but was bored by the politics. Later on I was really moved by the love stories, cried while reading the descriptions of the desert at night. On another read I was captivated by the bene gesserit’s plans, another time I was struck by the parallels with our oil driven economy, etc. I grew up reading dune and my understanding of it grew at the same time.

Over the next six months, I read every thing written by Frank Herbert and Tolkien. At about the same time the movie of Dune was released and disappointed so much. I started reading Heinlein, Asimov, Donaldson etc.. and haven't looked back since.

That was about 35 years ago and I don't think there has been a day where I have not been reading a novel or two. I don't get the same immersive feeling from movies or TV, there is just nothing like drifting off into a great book.

Dune is great and all, but it’s the War and Peace of sci-fi and I would have recommended something a bit less dense.

But I’m glad you liked it. Most people get through the first part (Paul joining the Fremen) and burn out pretty quickly thanks to all the interplanetary politics and economics. 

Now you should try **To Your Scattered Bodies Go** by *Phillip Jose Farmer* as a palate cleansing aperatif. It’s the start of a great series too, and involves celebrity main characters like Sir Richard Francis Burton the explorer, Sam Clemens, Manfred Von Richthofen, and Alice (In Wonderland) Hargreaves.

For more Sc-Fi:

**Isaac Asimov**: The Foundation series, Nightfall, and check out his short stories. One of my favourite writers of all time. His style is a bit ""plain"", but I think it works in the context of what he writes (robots).

**Arthur C Clarke**: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Childhood's End. They both kind of deal with existential type questions or questions about what's next for humanity.

**Douglas Adams**: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series (the publisher added an additional one after his passing written by Eoin Colfer [Artemis Fowl] which is pretty good too). These are comedy, and not to everyone's liking as the style is very British. If you like Monty Python or Doctor Who or British comedy, you'll love them.

**Orson Scott Card**: Ender's Game and the Ender's Shadow series. The Ender (main) series gets light on the action and heavy on the philosophy/discussion, the Shadow series stay in the same vein as the original Ender book and are more focused on the action/plot. I love both.

**Robert A Heinlein**: The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Stranger in a Strange Land. Both kind of deal with understanding others, how we interact, and how difficult it is to understand or see things from the viewpoint of others.

The books have shaped my thinking on all sorts of things from politics to ecology, every time I read them I get something new, they are so dense, that really unless you have read them all a couple of times you are really not getting all there is to get.  I have also noticed that as you age you get different things from them.  Really god damn good books.

You absolutely should read the rest of the frank Herbert books.  The sons books are horrible.  They hark back to a time of cheesy pulp sci-fi, all robots and lasers and no real depth.

You will be terribly disappointed if you have fallen in love with the dune universe and then see what Brian Herbert has done to it.

That said, it is one of the most rewarding series of books I have read. It is like *The Prince* in space on steroids with more of the nitty-gritty.

Different strokes for different folks—you can generally find opinions on these things all across the spectrum, but none of them is a substitute for the experience. (I'm probably just getting hung up on the ""worth the time"" phrasing—I think sharing opinions on books is a great way to gain exposure to new authors and worlds.)

Personally, I liked all of Frank Herbert's Dune books (I also liked his novel ""The White Plague""). I read a few of the ones that his son co-wrote and found them to be poor imitations. The stories weren't bad, but there was no style.

If you're doing the classics of sci-fi, you should delve into Asimov's Foundation series. Arthur Clarke's Rama series is also pretty good, as is Dan Simmons' Hyperion duology. If you want something really mind-bending, you could check out Gene Wolfe, although his prose is dense. If you like PKD, he has many other good books: My personal favorites are ""Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said,"" ""We Can Build You,"" and ""A Scanner Darkly"" (his short story collections are also good—if you read enough of them, you begin to realize how many of his ideas were adapted directly or borrowed in sci-fi over the last couple of decades). Finally, something new and epic—action movie meets noir: James SA Corey's The Expanse Series. Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy is also quite excellent and has some of the same sociopolitical themes as Dune, although over a shorter time frame.

The book is a lot of dialogue, but then again you have to help catch people up after a long time lapse in the series.  The 6th ends with a cliffhanger.

Recently, I bought the last two books written by his son that are supposed to finish up the original series. I've read the first one but realized I needed to read the original 3 in the timeline (Butlierian Jihad, Machine Crusade and Battle of Corrin) to make sure I knew the background for the last book.  I'm half way through Machine Crusade and having a hard time staying interested.  It's more action oriented but a lot of it seems like filler.  

Previously, I had read the house series by Brian and enjoyed it.  It's not the original by any means, but it was neat to see the main characters in Dune develop even if there were some inconsistencies.   The 3 I'm reading now explain the origins of the BG, guild and Ginaz mercenaries.  It's nice I guess but I feel like I was kind of suckered into buying those books to fully understand what is going on in the end.  They say it was Frank's outline they were working off of.

As far as the books his son wrote, that's a different story.  Some people love them and some people don't.  In general I have found that most people who really loved Frank's books didn't like his son's continuation of the universe.  Those who found Frank's books so so, loved the son's books.  

The main thing that makes me love Frank's writing and not his son's is in Frank's books hundreds of years can pass between books.  So many things have changed and the reader is left trying to figure out how they have changed via the politics and undercurrents between the characters.  In many cases, you truly never learn what changes there have been in society.  You know things changed, but you never quite know why they changed or what caused them and that mystery made the world interesting.  Brian spells almost everything out for the reader and removed that aura of the unknown; he also seems to completely define all the characters so there is no unknown thing about them.  For instance, he completely ruined the mystery around Duncan.  To me, he ruined Duncan; to other readers, they loved that aura around Duncan being defined.  So its all in the eye of the beholder.

With that said, Brian's books are more action packed and many people love his continuation of the Dune story.",Manetheren_TR,2014-04-15T14:25:18Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,19
232z62_20,232z62,"I'm going to do something that is rarely done and that is to defend Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson.

Brian and Kevin never claimed to try and recreate or even mimic what Frank did with the original Dune series. They were expanding it with their own style. It certainly isn't as cerebral and for many not necessary but if you enjoy the universe and want to explore what lies within it's truly fascinating. I'm also finding the more recent stuff better than the earlier stuff they were writing.

***HUGE SPOILER CONCERNING DUNE 7***
[Spoiler](/s ""Think of what even I consider a very dissatisfying ending where the Oracle of Time suddenly appears and zaps Omnius out of the universe. Duncan becomes the Kwisatz Haderach infused with machines, a 'machine god'. So the ending is a deus ex machina on several levels. The plot device where all the struggles of our protagonists are suddenly solved by the Oracle of Time. Omnius, the 'god of the machines' is defeated and the new god, Duncan, is now a machine. No matter how much I dislike the Oracle of Times DEM I can't help but give it an 'I see what you did there'. These guys aren't fools, they just have a different style."")

I'm a huge Dune nerd and a fool with an English degree. I've played for years on DuneMUD and soon I will be coding all the planets and inhabitants within for a MUD called 3Scapes. That requires me to deal with a lot of the expanded universe. I can't thank Brian and Kevin enough for what they done while a large portion of the fan base comes at them with knives drawn. It's because of their efforts every few years I can return to the Dune universe for another adventure.

Some great characters, great story... I think people sometimes expect a certain thing. The differing opinions have been my experience in talking with other fans who have read... and I should read more before slowly writing a response,  but fuck it!

Not the same way a bible is to others, necessarily,  but there is *something* within the story - of the six (original 'Dunes' by Frank) - that really grabs my attention. There is much in there, perhaps the patterns within patterns have a exponential influence over me, I do not know how to say it without many words and rambling at this time.

If you want a one off and like the writing of Dune but don't want to go all Dunesville, check out Destination Void. It's a one off about Artificial Consciousness. It's awesome!

book four is a good book but It's a stand alone story. (With it's back story in the trilogy of the first three books.)

I know a lot of people here say that they enjoyed the last two dune books, which are linked stories. I personally however never enjoyed them.  (I do plan to reread them some day just to see if it was me.)I feel like Mr. Herbert left the end of his story unfinished. And from what I've read from reviews, I don't want to go to the dark place that is the extended dune universe to find out where he might have wanted to go.

tldr: I would stop at book four. 

On a side Note: one of the few great things about getting old is being able to go back and reread books with new eyes after being away from the plot for years. I read dune in my late teen years; I'm now thirty and I've been rereading Dune. The one thing that jumps out at me, now that I'm older, is Frank Herbert had bigger ideas than he had writing skills.

Vested in the story/characters? Children of Dune may be worthwhile but  you may find you have sailed off the edge of the map.

In a similar vein, I would suggest Asimov's Foundation and Robot series. There's some damned good world-building there. 

Clarke's *Rendezvous with Rama* is a good one that is reminiscent of Verne, Wells and Doyle, but the follow-ups disappoint. *2001* and its sequels are interesting as well.

You almost can't go wrong with Phil Dick. He did go through a mystic/paranoiac phase toward the end that puts a lot of people off, but his experiments with unreliable narration (and reality) reward the contemplative reader. *Man in the High Castle* is among the first alternate history novels published, and the only one of his to win a Hugo, IIRC.

Huxley's *Brave New World* is a necessary companion to *1984* that many say more accurately describes the dark Utopia that we have actually built for ourselves. Put it at the top of your list if you haven't read it.

Of course there's always Vonnegut, who was always conflicted about being called a sci-fi writer (he wasn't one, really). *Slaughterhouse Five*, *Cat's Cradle*, *Galapagos*, *Player Piano*, and *Sirens of Titan* all qualify as top-notch sci-fi in that unique Vonnegut sort of way.

Of course, canon issues aside, I also really enjoyed the Butlerian Jihad trilogy. If you are willing to endure some slow books, then the ending is well worth your wait, and even better if you read the butlerian Jihad before you get there.

None is as good as the Dune series but Dragon in the Sea, The Dosadi Experiment, Destination Void, and others are extremely good sci-fi books. The treatment of science makes them borderline hard sci-fi but Herbert's focus on psychology and human actions under intense pressure are masterful. There's some silliness and Herbert's trademark complexity is all there so if you like Dune I'd highly recommend any of three.

Dragon in the Sea - His first novel set entirely on a submarine and focusing on the unraveling psyches of the small crew

Dosadi Experiment - Set in a world designed to be as awful as possible the characters are basically all super human since they need to be just to survive such a difficult world (think the Fremen.)

Destination Void - A pretty abstract look at artificial intelligence and human potential. Four scientists are basically trained up to be incredibly competent (a Herbert theme if ever there was one) and then put in a situation in which success is statistically impossible. The only way out is for them to basically transcend.

He's also got novels about sentient stars, a plague that wipes out almost all the women on present day Earth, and insects that band together to create communal organisms that look like people.

It is less about who the characters are and more about what they do, it's not much about how they interact with the world and more about how they act on it.

Brian Herbert's book are just bad: he completely misses the point of the original novels.

I liked it enough that when his son began expanding on the universe I was excited to read about how the atreides and Harkonen became hated enemies. I liked finding out about the Butlerian Jihad. 
While Brian does not have his fathers skill and while many will call his work fanfiction I was happy to get a peek at the larger universe of Dune.

The thing is that you will find different things to like in the later series.

Dune 1 is an exciting adventure with what feels like hyperintelligent and calculating cast of characters.  The feeling of newness and exploration of culture are what I love about the book

Dune 2-3 struggle because they don't have that special draw to the plot or characters

Dune 4 is possibly my favorite book.  The emphasis is entirely on political and cultural philopsophy, and you feel compassion and pain for your main character- one who I feel is as interesting as Paul in the first book.  You see the clash between the span of human life vs the thousands of years living as a god.  A great dialogue-based book.

Dune 5-6 again lose their main character, but gain some interesting and epic storylines.   

And the new dune books took all of the beloved choppy and actiony writing style out and replaced it with loooooooooooong looooooooong sentences laden with descriptions.

I read the Butlerian Jihad series, and found it nominally interesting but the problems with their writing become worse.

Sandworms of Dune and Hunters of Dune are supposed to be the series finale intended by Frank Herbert (I kind of doubt it), but I did like them a little more than the Butlerian Jihad ones.

In all, many of the books that followed gave more weight to the women of Dune, and actually helped build their characters better.  Developing good role model characters who are also female (instead of looking at women as uninteresting objects) determines for me if I'll stick with a series or not.

The theme of Dune is repeated in the next four books.  With a few changes mind you, but essentially repeated.  The fourth one is slightly interesting as the perspective of the book is different (that of almost solely Leto Atriedes) but it's the same recipe.

On a deeper note, his entire Dune-universe is depressing.  It's a low-technology nightmare with innumerable Middle-Eastern overtones.  The society is primitively feudalistic with no real structure.  Certainly not that expected of a sci-fi world.  One would expect, at the least, a universe where one could ask a BeanMachine for a hot cup of coffee.  Instead, BeanMachines are outlawed by this ridiculous Butlerian Jihad mode of thought.  The mere use of the word ""Jihad"" has so many overtones of religion that it destroys the entire framework for me.

By the time I actually hit Dune I was already invested in and enjoying the series. It wasn't the best I've read, but it was all pretty good. But when I actually started reading the original, I was blown away by just how much better it was both it terms of writing style and character development. Frank Herberts language seemed so much more evolved and thought provoking. It was on a completely different level than everything I had already read. The only downside to Frank Herberts writing is that when it was over, I lost interest with the other books his son had wrote that continued the story.

Sadly, of these, the second one Dune Messiah, was the weakest by a long way. I found Children of Dune (the third) to be one of the best but also the last two are pretty good too. 

It's just that, with Dune Messiah there is so much tying up of the loose ends from Dune itself, that there is not all that much plot of its own so it drags a bit.

232z62_165,232z62,"Well, I'll give it a go, even though by the time things hit the front page they're done to death. Dune was a masterpiece of it's time had even had some serious prescience (giggle) toward our own times. It speaks of a single-source dependent economy mixed with a religion that is outcast and beaten down. It speaks of a people who would rather destroy wealth than be enslaved to it. It has several obvious modern parallels but speaking from a more psychological perspective it also bleeds some teenage angst. Think about it from a teenagers perspective. Hereditary authority? Check. Dissatisfaction with the economic policies of the times? Check. Frustration with own lot in life? Check. Dreaming of unborn greatness? Check. Feelings of hidden talent and suppressed knowledge? This book was totally written toward a young generation which is why we're all engrossed with it in high-school but the feelings age as time goes on. The use of medieval weapons like knives is explained by shields that only let in slow moves. What teenage (male) didn't have a fascination with knives and swords at some point in life? My six-year-old is building light-sabers and he's only seen Star Wars once. Honestly, this book has so many new ideas, but... I'm going to get a lot of hate for this and I know it but I'm backed up by several thousand dollars in sci-fi literture and years spent turning pages: Frank Herbert really isn't that amazing a writer. He's an amazing thinker. He had ideas waaaay beyond his time in many ways (and in many other books) but he's an unbalanced writer. Pick a random sentence from Duncan, Leto, Jessica, Yueh, or Paul. Jumble them up and who says what? Do it with a whole script of dialogue. The man was genius, yes, but he cannot write succinct or definite characters. It actually traces through all his books. Amazing ideas that manage to transcend what comes across as rather single minded. The best he did was The Green Brain, and even that is masochistic as the old testament. I am a big Herbert fan, but lets not build monuments, he needed some help. The job he did in The White Plague was actually sort of offensive and I recognized that when I read it at 9.

In actual answer to your question, yes read the rest of the books. Up to Chapterhouse is exactly what you'd expect. As for the prequels and sequels -for Christs' sake it's not the  Necronomicon! Look, read the front cover and you'll see, it's not the same guy. This is like people who were offended when Brian Sanderson took over from Robert Jordan. Jesus folks, the author is DEAD. Quit whining and be grateful that you finally understood part of what was going on. Brian Herbert had access to the notes for what Frank thought the battle of Corrin was about and what The Enemy actually was. Truth be told I always felt like Dune was supposed to sell a script while the rest of the books were actually Frank's way of telling a story. It was only the middle of the story and there are GIANT gaps even there. What actually happens during the two years in the dessert? Where did the Jihad first go wrong between Dune and Children? Brian had a few bones and built a body out of it. Is he milking it? Of course he is. He's an author for God's sake. It's his job to write and make money....just like his dad!",,2014-04-16T02:11:47Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,165

That can be hard to take after Paul's hero's journey arc to dominate the Imperium by the end of *Dune*.

After Children, he basically got checks that any of us could retire on to write more Dune novels, and that's the other 3. After his death his son decided to pillage the corpse, supposedly with a box of notes in a shed previously undisclosed, that forms the basis for his sequel/prequel tinkering.

Think of Dune, and this is a bit apostasy, as Lucas taking 'the most filmable act' of the 12 part journal of the whills saga, and making that into Star Wars. Then after its success, they continued the arc and resolved the initial storyline in ROTJ. THat's now how it really went but its a good enough analogy for Herbert's story.

232z62_199,232z62,"I enjoyed all Dune books so far, in very different ways.  Frank Herbert's novels are like poetry.  It's a beautifully woven mesmerizing landscape populated by very memorable characters.

The sequels written by the son and the other guy?  They're decent space opera stories - completely different in every shape, way, and form, from the originals, aside from the characters and the setting.

So if you go into the seq/prequels hoping to read more Frank Herbert, you will be disappointed and you will likely end up throwing the book out your window.  If you go in expecting a light space opera read, you might actually enjoy it.  I know I did!  The house books were kind of meh, but I was glued to the Butlerian Jihad trilogy, even though the dialogue was at times a bit wooden.  The books they've released since then got better - dialgoue improved, characters improved, and the stories got more concise.

I get all the hate, but if you go into something expecting something else, you are going to have a bad time.  You can enjoy the books, if you're into softish space opera like stuff.

As for the originals, yes, they are very worth reading!  Although personally I am not a big fan of Dune Messiah.  I rate it very low, but that's my own personal opinion.

It's a necessary tale: the fall of an all-powerful messiah trapped by his own omniscience, with overtones of Hamlet and Julius Caesar. Every major faction conspires against him, he can see the possible deaths of everything and everyone he loves, the dismantling of his Godhood, and how the righteous jihad he started will bring chaos to the known universe. Everything that made Paul a hero in the first book becomes the instrument of his own destruction. I can't think of a more powerful ending to his story -- even his ""death"" is ignoble.

Finally, Messiah sets the stage for God Emperor, where Leto II puts himself in the same position -- a contrast between morality trap of his father and the image of the immortal, inhuman despot he portrays.

It's better than the David Lynch movie, but production design felt marred by a small budget & the acting felt too theatrical. Special Effects weren't there yet, Game Of Thrones has proven that a television budget can accomplish those things now. Dune doesn't have a chance as a movie, it's too slow and its story arc takes place over too long a time.

In Paul of Dune, [it is revealed that the events in the original Dune books are an unreliable history written by Irulan.](/spoiler) This conveniently solves the problem of reconciling the characters written by Brian and Kevin with their conspicuous absence in the originals.

I honestly think Brian is a good author. His novel with his father was great, and I've read some of his other works and they're really interesting. However, I think Anderson has the primary voice in the prequels, and he is straight scifi pulp. I even heard him say at a signing that he writes by taking long walks and talking into a voice recorder, then transcribing with some editing. This may work for his normal fare, but it accounts for how loose and bland his narrative is, and how packed full of vapid action it is compared to FH (who would blatantly skip that crap).",,2014-04-16T01:44:12Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,239

Atreide is easy because when you play them you don't have to play against them, and sonic tanks are just a pain in the ass, let alone dealing with the shitton of freemen they'll pop on your ass during the later missions.
Harkonen is med because you still get the nuke, but have weak race unit.

* OK at best: Paul of Dune, Butlerian Jihad, Winds of Dune


I haven't read any of the others so they may have taken a downturn at this point. I really loved how they wrote Sandworms to be honest but it really feels like they're just milking a cash cow at this point. I did however like the prequels for what they were, they added interesting backstory (after I had read the original 6) and made reading the original 6 interesting in a different way. I will say that going from House Corrino to Dune feels a little like going from watching a Star Wars prequel to watching the Original (the Dune prequels however are not nearly as laughably bad, if enjoyable).

I was in a philosophy class in college when I read *God Emperor* and the teacher brought up the argument that the ideal theoretical ruler was an infinitely wise tyrant with absolute power. And I had *GEoD* fresh in mind and saw so many flaws in that argument...

Like I must not read books just because this one particular book isn't clicking with me just yet lol. That said, I hadn't heard of Dune until a few years ago when my mom talked about seeing the 80's film when it came out and how she was weirded out by it. So naturally I forced her to rewatch it as I watched it for the first time. She liked the film better the second time around.

Regardless of all that, so far I'm just not a fan of the writing style, that's it. A couple other commenters are under the impression that I don't understand it, which is not the case. I understand it just fine. I just feel there is way too much exposition, and maybe some of this stuff within the first 200 or so pages could have been explained in tandem with the main story instead of essentially being, in my mind, a wiki-style prose in preparation for what is to come. I honestly feel like I haven't even started reading the actual book yet even though I have, if that makes sense.

I really want to get to the meat of the story but so far it is a slog for me. It could be because I subconsciously had different expectations, but I don't know. I don't want to give up just yet because I'm still interested in seeing what's to come, but I might have to pace myself even more because I am just not that engaged at this moment.",dothebork,2022-11-04T22:06:05Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,21

I speak a few languages. But, I don't speak French. So if I stared at a really good french language book trying to ""get the experience,"" I'm clearly not getting it.

And in the same way, what other people are getting out of the book, like Dune, that leaps off the page for them, the insights, the observations, the societal metaphors - if that's not leaping off the page for you - then you're not getting it - and forcing your self to read all the words so you can say you moved your eyeballs across all the words is just bluster-muster then, yeah?

Surely, you sometimes drop in to some sub-reddit, maybe it's /r/programmerhumor or maybe it's some teen-humor, or gardener-memes - but you've been somewhere that you just realize, the jokes that are clearly full of meaning to THEM don't ring with me because I don't have enough contextual understanding for this to provide me with the experience that it provides them with.

**TL:DR - I agree, it's not all ""pleasure reading,"" but if the book isn't engaging you, it's a good sign you're not getting the value that's laid down on the page anyway - so you're better off picking up books that allow you to pick up the content.**",,2022-11-05T03:56:10Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,23

Yeah, I know, the Brian/Kevin novels have a much different (arguably lower) style than the original Frank Herbert works.  But I'm not a purist or a Frank Herbert loyalist, so that's not an issue for me.  I am, however, a completist, so I've been reading all those novels as they've been published.

Brian and Kevin started, but haven't finished, a series of four novels under the series title ""Heroes of Dune"" that take place between the first and second Frank Herbert novels.  About a decade ago they published the first two of these four novels (""Paul of Dune"" and ""The Winds of Dune"") -- but then the last two were postponed in favor of the far-distant-past prequels.

Which have now been finished.  Do Brian and Frank have any plans to go back and publish the last two books in the Heroes series?

For anyone else wondering about the same, there are a few great stopping points before hitting the awful Brian Herbert & Kevin J Anderson novels:

- Just read the original *Dune*. Works well as a standalone.
- Continue on to *Dune Messiah & Children of Dune*. The story of Paul Atreides and his children is continued and everything established in Dune is pretty much concluded.
- Continue on to *God Emperor of Dune*, it continues over three thousand years after the events of original trilogy. Works as a great conclusion to the whole saga, as it resolves some plot points that were still left hanging after *Children of Dune*. Along with Dune, this one is a clear favourite of many.
- Continue on to *Heretics of Dune & Chapterhouse: Dune.* These two start a new story about a thousand years after God Emperor. Ends with a cliffhanger and the story of these two is only concluded in the mostly disliked Brian Herbert + Kevin J Anderson books *Hunters of Dune & Sandworms of Dune.*",deboocha,2018-02-05T12:23:12Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,42

In, in general,articularly like the read-as you go approach (someone else here in books called it that), when you get a ton of information and don't know yet what to do with it. It makes me curious. What I don't like is when the story reaches a natural culmination, i.e. story arcs are closed, and the series continues because it was succesful.

Dune is special to me because it focuses so heavily on philosophy, morality and power. Herbert does this not in an abstract way but in a very real and harsh manner. I understand that for some or a lot of people this seems like endless rambling but I liked it a lot which is why I also liked God Emperor.

One of my biggest gripes with modern stories are soft characters that are not punished for their softness. Humans are humans and humanity has forever been and will likely forever been a ruthless powerstruggle.

As another example I appreciated I'd like to mention The three body problem which also taps into power dynamics as it's main topic.",Round-Region-5383,2023-12-30T10:13:53Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2

Well, I thought the overall story was fairly pointless and annoying. It's about a prescient whose prescience fails at every moment where there is dramatic tension. He's driven more by those visions than he is by the revenge story that actually happens in the novel.

Well, I thought the characters were boring caricatures with very little depth. The villains were gratuitously villainous for cliched reasons. The heroes spent more time having dialog about their emotions than actually emoting.

Well, I didn't care for the world building. The sand worms and mission protectiva were kinda cool, if not the most believable of things. None of the other setting elements really captured my imagination. A lot of them felt extremely artificial (e.g. I want to write about sword fighting, so shields require ""attack slow, defend quickly""), and many elements were introduced and only really relevant for one or two scenes (the whole gladiator fight, antigravity suspenders).

So, upon reflection I didn't like Dune. It was a strange realization, as I read the whole thing cover-to-cover in about two weeks, and at no point did I feel I was reading a book I didn't like.",AceOfFools,2015-12-29T07:43:38Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,5

The author could have easily made this a fantasy book without changing the story - the Bene Geserit would be wizards/witches, the worms would be magical creatures.

Even the main hero covering himself with worm blood and gaining superpowers would have made more sense in a fantasy novel than in science fiction.

No need for other planets - just make the desert some far off land in the same planet.

I love sci-fi.  I love fantasy.  It seems like a great mingling of the two and everyone loves it, but it's just brutalizing me.

I'm mostly giving it a shot again because I enjoyed Mad Max: Fury Road.  Once again, a movie that has everything that doesn't appeal to me... post-apoc/post-nuke, cars, deserts.  But I was literally overwhelmed by how much I enjoyed that movie.

I guess I just keep hoping Dune will catch me at some point, but I find it just as much a chore each time I try.  Paul seems like an insufferable Mary Sue.  Vlad Harkonnen seems like an absolute stereotype of everything bad about a one-dimentional antagonist.

Then *Children Of Dune* takes you someplace unexpected and is pretty thought-provoking.  *God Emperor of Dune*, though, becomes something completely different and now you're in this world, but as you're reading sci-fi, you're also reading a sweeping political science thesis.

We were discussing how in the book Dune, they don't give you the explanations for everything in the universe, and leave it up to the reader whether they want to piece it together from outside sources or just leave some stuff a mystery.  So many people praise the depth of Herbert's world due to this.

Alternatively, Destiny employs a very similar method of laying out their world.  The world can be played entirely in game and there will be gaps in what is explained to the player, but there is a huge amount of background information available if someone wants to go looking for it.

Oddly, while Dune is so highly praised for this, Destiny is again and again berated for it.  Anyway, just thought that was interesting.",jrakosi,2015-12-29T14:20:04Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,32

Here's a great anecdote from Paul Stamets, it fits very well and I would very much like it to be true, but who knows what is and isn't.

>Frank went on to tell me that much of the premise of Dune — the magic spice (spores) that allowed the bending of space (tripping), the giant worms (maggots digesting mushrooms), the eyes of the Freman (the cerulean blue of Psilocybe mushrooms), the mysticism of the female spiritual warriors, the Bene Gesserits (influenced by tales of Maria Sabina and the sacred mushroom cults of Mexico) — came from his perception of the fungal life cycle, and his imagination was stimulated through his experiences with the use of magic mushrooms.",ComradePyro,2015-12-28T19:44:44Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,35

3yjaaa_37,3yjaaa,"Mystery and mysticism are not the same thing, and your confusion of the terms informs my understanding of why we disagree.

Your preference for the technology and science of Dune is interesting, since the technology in the main Dune sequence and in the prequels and sequels is not well-developed. In the original series it's not important - technologies and phenomena such as shields and the Holzmann effect are invented to meet specific needs within the setting and themes, such as the return to hand-to-hand combat and the Mutually Assured Destruction by which the balance of power in the Lansraad is held. Since little of the technology in the books has any root in real-world science, it doesn't really matter how much the Brian & Kevin club expand upon it - it's still just woo-woo to make the original world plausible, and since they have few new ideas the exploration becomes hollow. That's where Frank Herbert's brilliance lies - his setting is unobtrusive and allows concentration on the human themes. In fact the story could be relatively easily transposed into another setting - fantasy being the most obvious - and still work perfectly. The one area that Frank really does integrate tightly with the setting is ecology - and this is an area that doesn't receive detailed attention in the novels by his son. Science fiction that explores technology can be interesting of course - but I'd look to Hard Science Fiction writers to do that.",GeneralStrikeFOV,2015-12-29T09:52:04Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,37

Huge swathes of Hunters and Sandworms of Dune are on par with a Wikipedia breakdown - and didn't need to be there at all. I accidentally read Sandworms first which made it glaringly obvious how little any of Hunters of Dune was needed. 

Everything is explained, characters don't even become caricatures they just become stereotypical good guys/bad guys. Murbella and Duncan Idaho both have hokey rallying speeches for instance, and their motivations are explained as very simple 'need to keep everyone alive!' 'Have to keep fighting out of principle!' which is a huge step out of the universe they were meant to be in. 

Instead of plans within plans everything is shallow, characters explain everything to each other in painful detail, and aside from clichéd writing they use actual clichés a distracting amount.",climbtree,2015-12-29T20:29:50Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,38

The Jedi can use their mind tricks to implant suggestions into people like the Bene Gesserit's voice can. Giant worms feature more than once in the original trilogy, as does a dessert planet. People consume a lot of spice to gain prescience, Jedi embrace the force to get the same thing. 

Things go up a notch when it comes to the prequels, where the Jedi(Bene Gesserit) are looking for their messiah who's a super powerful version of themselves, the think they've got the right guy, Anakin(Paul), but it turns out that they mis-calculated and it's his son Luke(Leto), who also has a twin sister.

3yjaaa_41,3yjaaa,"The Bene Gesserit is using all of humanity in their breeding program, its's a theme of the books. In DUNE Lady Margot Fenring captures Harkonnen genes by seducing Feyd Rautha and it's mentioned some unlucky member of the Bene Gesserit had seduced the Baron himself.

In the last two books the Sisterhood talks openly of wanting to get their hands on the Tleilaxu genes but Waff and the Masters will not allow it.

The Bene Gesserit and the Tleilaxu are running similar breeding programs with different methods to achieve the same ends; to create an all purpose human being who can survive and thrive in any environment to ensure the continuation of humanity. 

The reason the God Emperor oppresses humanity for 3500 years is to ensure there will be an explosive diaspora across the universe when he dies. He breeds Siona and the Duncan's so they are invisible to prescient spying, making them safe and able to hide from predators like the Guild Navigators who would use them and their bloodlines to pressure and control them. The God Emperor is the ultimate Bene Gesserit ally as he expresses to his journals.

In Chapter House Dune we meet Daniel and Marty, shadowy, spectral figures Duncan Idaho can see in his visions. My own personal theory is that they are the Tleilaxu Kwisatz Haderach, two super beings, able to switch genders, change their appearances and holding the entirety of the Bene Tleilax racial and genetic memory. They are survival machines.

The difference in the Gesserit and Tleilax is the the Sisterhood doesn't like external genetic manipulation. The have achieved the female super being in the Reverend Mother. They were searching for the male equivalent, achieving their goal in Paul, Leto, Teg and the Duncans. These male / female pairings would be lifeboats / Noah's Ark for humanity to survive in extremis.

If Frank had written the last book I think we would have seen the Bene Gesserit and Bene Tleilax form an alliance to conquer and seed the universe with life.",whatzzart,2016-01-01T21:08:56Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,41

Dune, and indeed most good SciFi is not really about character building the way the SoIaF is. Epic Fantasy is, generally speaking, about telling a story and taking you to another world. Good SciFi is about presenting ideas and philosophies that are impossible to address in a real-world setting. 

Dune isn't about building relatable characters. It's about the **Melange** (the nature of reality, perception), and **the nature of HUMAN BEINGS**. What makes us human, how we can be whipped up into a Jihad, and how prophets are born.

My only recommendation as to your enjoyment would be don't gloss it - it's a dense, kinda confusing book, and the more awake/active you are when reading, the more you'll enjoy it. If at the end of the book you felt you got all there was to offer and didn't like it, don't bother continuing the series. It only gets weirder from there.

Read what you like. Dune is very, very different from something like Song of Ice and Fire though. You say you can't connect to Paul - you're not necessarily supposed to, but I think you're supposed to be fascinated and bewildered by his mind and his path. Whereas Song of Ice and Fire gives you a plethora of fleshed out, relatable, human characters, in a wide, wide world.

I'd compare Dune more to Sci-fi books like Stranger in a Strange Land or Orson Scott Card's Worthing Saga, which take a really strange person and deify them over the course of the book, as you follow from their point of view.

13g5vt_8,13g5vt,"Absolutely, you should finish it. Dune is one of those novels that I can re-read every 10 years and it will mean something different to me each time. I first read it as a teenager and had about the same assessment of it as you did. The political and religious themes didn't really speak to me. I read it again in my twenties and got fascinated by it.  I read it this last time and shared it with a friend and I finally get it.  I think it actually did a lot to change my view of religion and politics.  Others might attach more to the environmental themes but the book has something for everyone.

The great thing about the first book is that it can be enjoyed as a standalone story with a satisfying ending.  The second and third books introduce Paul's children and give a good picture of how the religion that grows up around him loses its way as corruption seeps in. The fourth book is very heavy with philosophical monologues but fast-forwards the story about 3500 years and makes the Dune universe truly epic in scope as we see how it's evolved. It provides a good conclusion to the story of the Atreides.  

I would recommend stopping there.  The final two books by Herbert were written later in his life and are extremely meditative and tend to wander around a lot. I trudged through them in order to experience the entire series but aside from common elements like the Bene Gesserit, they don't even feel like the same series at times and are extremely dry.

Not everyone will agree with me on this but I really do recommend the two miniseries that the SciFi channel did of the first three books. They're not perfect but it's the best we have so far and it will give you a decent introduction to the world of Dune and help you appreciate the book(s) more.

Don't worry, this fades over time and you learn how to enjoy other things again. As for Dune, you're that far into it then you should finish it. It's pretty great stuff. Hopefully you'll come back to it one day and enjoy it.

You mentioned wanting strong female characters. I wanted to encourage you to think about Princess Irulan from a feminist perspective. Princess Irulan is a historian, and essentially the narrator of Dune--excerpts from her ""books"" are featured as epigraphs to many of the chapters. You haven't reached the end of the book yet, but if/when you do, think about her role as a narrator and why she might have been chosen to be the narrator of the book. What does it say about her as a character & as an attempt to assert agency over the situation/assign herself as the expert on the life of the Muad'dib? It's honestly a very interesting choice.

In an America of plenty, it reminded us of scarcity and of conservation. It was a science-fiction novel that took politics seriously. It conceived of the rejection and downfall of computers even before computers had become ubiquitous. It postulated a world where nuclear weapons were obsolete and the biological sciences, genetics, cloning, were the cutting edge. It reminded us that people, human institutions and their traditions are more powerful than all the shiny gadgets in the universe.

I felt that most of Paul's character growth followed the typical route of adolescent power fantasy, and while he certainly began to grow past that towards the end of the novel, by that point I had lost interest in his character and personal struggle.

That said, I probably still enjoyed it more than you say you're enjoying it. I didn't really hold that part against it, it just made me realize that it was probably a bad book to read as an adult. I thought the main antagonists of the novel, the Harkonnens, were still great, however. They're utterly contemptible, and their potential defeat at Paul's hand, I felt, was more than enough momentum to drag me through the rest of the novel.

I had the same problem with the female characters in the book, though. Most of them seemed to exist basically to either protect Paul or further his greatness. Even his love interest seemed to be largely framed in her ability to provide him with a successor.

Hope that helps you decide whether or not to drop it, and I hope my post doesn't contain anything that might spoil the novel for you, should you continue reading it.

Martin has been writing novels on a part time basis -5 novels between 1977/96- since the seventies none of which set the world on fire although some of his shorts were good -Sandkings springs to mind but Wildcards were pedestrian- and hit it big with Song of Ice etc
And that is not that good, I cannot see it having the same staying power as Dune nor can I see it becoming a classic nor Martin achieving Master status

So, if you wish to stay true to what you like read stuff like Songs of Ice. And really, that is how one should read. But you should always push your boundaries, read outside your comfort zone, your preferred genres

13g5vt_51,13g5vt,"You know how the Star Wars prequel took every mysterious reference, every cool minor character, and FORCED them to fit into a new cash-cow setting? Brian couldn't come up with his own new stuff for his own series, and couldn't come up with new stuff for his dad's series, so he ALTERED HIS FATHER'S WORKS by changing the background of the characters.

FOR INSTANCE:
In Dune, we gradually learn about the ""Old Duke"", Paul's grandfather. In particular, we have the amazing scene where Shadout Mapes and Jessica deal with the stuffed bull. The shreds of information about the Old Duke we learn from that one conversation, decades after his death, by themselves flesh out so much of the man.

There is an artistic virtue called ELEGANCE. Elegance in writing is not the same thing as just reducing word count, or using denser words...it is figuring out how to IMPLY things, how to create emotional associations and moods without heavy-handed and tedious levels of verbiage. It is perfect lossless compression. In the dozen sentences of direct references to the Old Duke, we learn enough about him to understand his essence. Any more information than that is a burden! So when Brian actually uses him as a character, or actually shows Jessica's origins, or the completely ridiculous and drawn out explanation of Leto's spiritually hardened soul, the elegance is gone. 

Sometimes silence on a topic is more information dense than an entire book.

The prequels and sequels could have been good sword-and-planet adventure books if they were not Dune books, but they were transparent attempts to cash in. No artistic value. Frank's books constitute a massive thought experiment about the power of myth, messiahs, interactions between religious systems, Machiavellian realpolitik, and the evolution of human society. Brian takes the mystery and magic out of that. His books use the entire Dune series as source material, so if you read his stuff first, it is like being spoiled on the REAL Dune.

As an aside, the way Brian completely changed the trajectory of the story of Dune though his sequels to be a final confrontation with the robots is one of the most PATHETIC moves I have ever witnessed in the sorry world of sequel cash-cow mania.

Frank's characters are some of the most dynamic I've encountered in science fiction.  Obviously you can have your own opinion, but I disagree.

Some of the series, Dune and God Emperor of Dune (which is easily my favorite from the entire series), focus more on Frank masterfully exploring and developing interesting themes.

What's your point? You read Dune already, and though it is set in a SF universe, in many way it can be considered fantasy too. In fact, I'm pretty sure you can tell the same story in a fantasy world without changing much of it. In fact, Dune has a lot in common with a Song of Fire and Ice, even though it is not the same story. The two talk about political shenanigans in feudal systems with few characters being totally good or bad. And there is some kind of surnatural powers too. Pretty much fantasy stuff.

> they'll be considered classics at least in the fantasy genre.

For a Song of Fire and Ice, only time will tell how it age. Though I would be surprised if it was still around in fifty years. Then again, there are more and more story written, so it's difficult to foresee anything about how the stories of today will be remembered. ",DarfWork,2012-11-20T08:57:30Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,74
13g5vt_75,13g5vt,"- **SPOILERS AHEAD IN THE NAME OF REFUTING FALSEHOODS**

>disgust for overt homosexuality

Contrary to your claims, **Frank Herbert blatantly portrayed Duncan Idaho as antiquated and ignorant in his intolerant views regarding the gay relationships accepted (and encouraged) by Leto II's Fish Speakers** in *God Emperor of Dune*.

>the special place women cannot go or see, that only a male can

He does implicitly play into classic gender roles when he describes the male and female relationships in this context, but I think your understanding of the canon is very rudimentary (and therefore the deeper meanings within the context are probably lost to you).

**First of all, he's speaking about oracles and ""oracular vision"" in particular.** This plays very heavily in the themes about religion in general, but more importantly, if one understands this quote in relation to the events that happen throughout the series (and I'm not speaking about the contributions by his son), you would understand that this is in fact a form of praise for women.

In the *Dune* mythos, Frank Herbert describes the first oracles and religious leaders as women. This is hinted at by the existence of the matriarchal Bene Gesserit, but it is also peppered throughout the entire series. Religious authority was wrested from women when it became a power structure, or in other words, competition from their male counterparts in society. The Bene Gesserit are an allegory of restoring religious authority (*and thus a large contributor to our collective works as a collection of populations*) to women, but for very positive reasons.

In the *Dune* universe, the Bene Gesserit seek the Kwisatz Haderach (aka *a being who would see all possible futures and thus being able to select threads of time to be realized through manipulation*), who will ultimately save humanity and direct it toward the [golden path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Path_(Dune\)), to save humanity from destruction. **The claim to need a male**, *because women cannot ""go"" to the perspective where all future possibilities exist*, **is because a man has an inherent superiority *complex*, not an inherent *superiority*.** He cites males as the first to experiment with psychedelics and dangerous forms of mysticism. He also cites the rash nature of males, who stereotypically put themselves before the greater good of the community, whereas women stereotypically make terrific sacrifices in the name of the greater good. **He's saying that women are not able to travel into the type of prescience which would show them the most evil and horrific future which was necessary to save humanity, only a man could be callous enough to see it and make it happen**, which was Leto II's 3500 year tyranny, where he took control of mankind's destiny and painfully shaped their evolution in order to improve the species as a whole.

**The Bene Gesserit,** (*who are almost entirely unaware of their unconscious-but-collective ambition until well after the death of Leto II*) **are a symbol for both the harbinger of humanity's salvation, but also for opposing** (*and wresting power back from*) **the petty, insignificant empires built from the leadership of men.**

Additionally, **the most hated House in the series is House Harkonnen, who were easily the most misogynistic.** The least misogynistic is arguably House Atreides, or one of its Allies.

Lastly, on this point of gender, **the most egalitarian society in the entire series is also the most revered throughout: the Fremen.** Their women are equivalent in their social standing as men, and both gender roles within the community equally distribute labor.

>effeminate mirror of Paul that is Fenring, but flawed as a eunuch (aka gay).

That is not the definition of a eunuch. Furthermore, in almost every circumstance, eunuchs are metaphorical for either between genders or neither gender, but very rarely are they representative of a homosexual, because the very definition of a eunuch is male with (*all or part of*) his sex organs removed (*or non-functional*). I only mention other examples of their metaphorical use as exemplifying the principle that **you cannot simply equate ""eunuch"" with ""homosexual"".**

Additionally, **Fenring is a eunuch only in a very specific religious context**, related to the lineage of the Bene Gesserit breeding program. Fenring was only a ""eunuch"" in regards to his ability to become or produce a Kwisatz Haderach. In *Dune*, **it specifically mentions that Fenring was married and had an exceptionally beautiful wife.**

Most importantly, Fenring was implicitly given a significant amount of praise at the end of *Dune* when he chose to disobey the Emperor when ordered to murder Muad'Dib when he was vulnerable. It went as far as to hint that he was even more powerful than Paul, because Paul realized his own powerlessness to avoid the future he had built for himself (which were likely the culminating allusions to his whole theme in *Dune Messiah*).

For those who may not know, Frank Herbert died before completing the Dune series (unless you consider Chapterhouse to be a finale, which is fair), and in the early 2000's his son Brian found outlines for a final book. He enlisted Anderson to help write it. They started by writing a number of prequels, then split the last book into 2. 

I was 17-18 when the last 2 came out and hated them as only a teenager can hate new books in a series that deviate too far from what he thinks they should be. I haven't read them since and I'm sure I'd feel differently.

pl8h1d_2,pl8h1d,"I just finished Dune and I wasn’t overly impressed. It was a fine read and I am going to continue on but it just felt very dull. The main things I had a problem with were the characters, the world building, the lack of action, and the reviews I heard about it before reading.

The characters felt boring and one dimensional. I couldn’t relate to any of them. Now, I know this might not have been a focus of Herbert so I can excuse that, it’s just something I personally had a hard time with.

The world building felt very surface level to me. I felt like I was giving a lot of terms and concepts about the tech, the planet, the religion, but very rarely were any of those things actually explored. I still don’t feel like I have a firm grasp on a lot of what was mentioned. Now, I didn’t read the appendices so this one is partially on me, but tbh nothing in the book made me want to read them.

The lack of action is mostly about the final battle. I was expecting a big fight where we really got to see how good the Ferman were as warriors, and instead it felt like we only heard about how great they are. In fact it felt like through the whole book we only heard about how great they were. The only time we see one fight he is bested by an outsider so handily that the spectators thought he was toying with him, and I’m supposed to believe these people are able to kill the Emperor’s best warriors at a rate of 5 to 1? It felt like a lot of time we were just told about fights rather than experiencing them. I will say the 1v1 fights were great, probably my favorite scenes in the book.

My biggest problem was that I had heard from people that this book gets “very philosophical” and that it really explores “philosophical themes”. I love philosophy, and I love philosophy in my fiction, I felt like this book had almost none of it. I cannot recall a time where a philosophical idea was actually explored. Touched on? Sure. Explored, not at all. I was really expecting some philosophical exploration and I feel like I was robbed of that. I read the Three-Body Problem trilogy this year and I felt like those books really explored philosophical themes and I was expecting at least that level from Dune, and I just didn’t get it.

I know these opinions are in the minority so I was hoping someone could try to enlighten me to what I missed. I really am feeling like I am just not getting something, but I don’t even know what I’m not getting. I really want to love this book, or at least see what those who love it see, but right now I just don’t.",,2021-09-22T04:17:04Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2

I always intended to read the books, but instead read a lot of other stuff. With the new movie out, I thought I’d read the source before watching, given how confused I was before.

I have now finished the first book. And I’m not a fan. 

The start is slow and confused. It mixes unnecessary philosophical tangents with undefined neologisms that cannot be inferred from syntax. Characters are referred to with multiple names, forcing the reader to stop and remember who is being referred to.

After the first clash between the pro- and antagonist the story picks up. But it is often blighted by narrator changes mid scene. The passage of time is often not made explicit and only by inference can one tell weeks or years pass between scenes.

The technology of the society is a strange mishmash of anachronisms. Spaceships, force fields and ornithopters, swords and words of power.

I can see what Herbert is trying to do, but I believe he only just makes it. We get hints of a vast, ancient society. We get some political intrigue of a feudal ruling class, some anthropology of desert people, a mix of middle eastern and western cultures and languages, a few weird aliens and an unsatisfactory climax of a battle.

Hi bookish friends,_x000D_  
So I did it: I finished Dune. It took me literal years. I had to restart it twice, and finally, with the new 2021 movie and a bit more gumption under my belt, I finished it. And I am left... perplexed. It was absolutely an enjoyable read. The setting was phenomenal. The characters were fascinating, if deeply flawed. The mix of Bene Gesserit ""magic"" and hardcore futuristic technology created the perfect high-fantasy-scifi drama. But as I got deeper and deeper into the book, and Paul got closer and closer to attaining his demigod-like status, I found a bad taste entering my moth. As the book began, I found the story of young Paul and his mother endearing. In fact, Jessica was my favorite character, followed closely by Chani. But as the book progressed and Paul took up more and more of the center stage, I found the female characters in the book relegated to a hard sideline. Jessica, who was previously a powerhouse of a woman, suddenly became demure and deferential to Paul. While I understand that this might be to pound home the idea that Paul has become significantly more powerful, I can't help feel a sense of loss for Jessica's nuanced character. The final lines of the book felt like a nail in this coffin, as Jessica and Chani looked on at Paul ascending to the throne. The final line of the book comes from Jessica, as she states to Chani,_x000D_  
""While we, Chani, we who carry the name of concubine—history will call us wives.”_x000D_  
To end on this line, this line that suggests that Jessica and Chani's contribution to this story was just to be ""wives,"" was heart wrenching. Here were my two favorite characters watching someone else rise to power, and all they get to do is watch and be ""wives."" I was devastated._x000D_  
_x000D_  
So r/books I'd like to know your take: should I continue with this series? Or am I doomed to be dissapointed? The entire first book was driven by Jessica for me, not Paul. I'd love to see more from Chani or Alia too. In short, do we see these strong female characters contribute in later Dune novels? Or does it stay centered on Paul?_x000D_

They do, at times, seem to be a bit too wordy but I disagree that the new characters aren't any good and contradict Frank's stories. They mostly came from notes Frank wrote before he died for crying out loud! The prequels especially are interesting because they fill in the story of the universe of Dune before the first novel.

Both of them struggle to control the fire of the Jihad and it’s consequences, but yeah, you do see it to some extent. The wars take place and scores of billions die as a result off-screen, so to speak. Paul is aware of this when his path is set before him in the first book, but is pretty callous about its consequences. l like the analogy to the Biblical story of King David: a promising hero at first but eventually becomes a resentful despot. If what you’re looking for is a scene similar to, for instance, Tony Stark getting confronted by the mom of a child he inadvertently killed in Captain America: Civil War, there isn’t anything like that here. Still, there is an attempt to rehabilitate and co-opt his legacy for political goals, so there is still some insightful things the series as a whole has to say about myth-making and charismatic leaders!<

There are more interesting characters to meet later in the books, but my favorite parts are where the plot slows down, or just discusses the ecology or politics of this universe.

1atlh0w_1,1atlh0w,"I mean, the first book is a setup for the downfall in the second book (and really they are, imo one book split into two parts...the rise and fall of Paul), the stuff you complained about seems like you're missing the point. Who gives a shit about the fascist super soldiers losing off screen when it was already made clear the Fremen were better on top of being in their peak environment. The Fremen are supersoldiers produced in an environment intentionally by the powers that be((which is super fucked up)) to produce an army to overrun the existing power paradigm that was entrapping people...however, it lacked the necessary goals of a constructive next step and so the movement in itself is destructive. To destroy evil without a concept of a better world is to produce that same evil on a cycle (and in this case, worse). Nobody, at least me, wants to sit through a fight scene where the inevitable fact of what we know comes true. The Fremen, while oppressed, we know will become the oppressors as we throughout the book find out that Paul's visions are coming true with or without his agency because everything has been put into place for this moment to occur with the knowledge or care about what it will inevitably lead to...a fascistic genocide out of the control of the person in charge.

The Benni Gesserit spent HUNDREDS (maybe it was millenia?) of years preparing the Fremen for Paul and Paul represents their intentions for control, but what really are the Benni Gesserit?

His precients throughout the book is built up to be his knowledge of the world he exists in and the inevitable downfall because of his position that he is unwilling/unable to fight against. In this sense, for me, the novel is in part a horror novel and finding out you are the monster. So Paul maintains himself as protagonist while also being the monster that he cannot stop because he is only what he is.

And in general I think it more accurately reflects the realities of how the thing Herbert is writing about actually comes together. The person who needs the catharsis doesn't get it, the tools they used to take out the threat are double edged, and in the end even when they win we know the reality of what is to come because of this win and how it was obtained through generations of manipulation and cohersion is far more dire.

In its time, Dune was a very scathing criticism of the types of fantasy books that the world was being built around and the ways in which people were bleeding that type of narrative into reality (and fantasy like that still gets made and people still treat individuals as infallible guides to sign off on their violent desires...I mean, look at Trump). Cults of personality allowing people to do terrible things with or without the real intention of the people in charge.

The ending wasn't so much for me the ""victory of Paul"" and was more the beginning of an era of suffering and destruction the likes of which the galaxy has ever seen. It was a horror sequence, Paul is now trapped in his destiny and the inevitable outcome of that destiny Paul has already shown to us and so we know what follows is worse than the systems in which he was fighting against.

(the book series is fairly pessimistic if taken as a philosophy, and I don't think it is. I think it's just a critique of the time and the ways in which fantasy was being written)

For me personally, reading the first book without reading the second book is like cutting off the movie halfway because you thought the mid-point twist wasn't the fantasy you wanted...when it's just the midpoint.

And I wouldn't really call any of this spoilers as Paul himself tells us what will happen in the middle of the book through his visions.",magvadis,2024-02-18T04:33:25Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1
1atlh0w_2,1atlh0w,"Yeah the first part of your criticism is very fair, Frank Herbert isn’t exactly the best at entertaining you with his writing. He could have explored the battles and politics more, in that I agree.

BUT the part of Paul being a Mary Sue couldn’t be less true. My dad once said the entirety of the Dune Series is basically a summary of Paul’s mistakes.

Consider it this way : Paul has his visions, he sees the genocide that will be committed in his name. At first, he convinces himself he must stop it. But as his journey with the Fremen progresses, he simply doesn’t stop. All he has to do is step back and nope out, and it would prevent the genocide because the entire myth around Paul hasn’t been developed yet.

But fundamentally Paul is a weak-willed character, so he remains on his path of destruction. Eventually the myth around him builds up and all of Paul’s visions confirm the genocide. So for his mental sanity, Paul convinces himself the future is set in stone and nothing he could have done would change the outcome.

In the next book, as Paul’s empire collapsed around him, he realises the future is NOT in fact set in stone, and could be molded by one’s actions. But peering too much into the future (as Paul did) basically collapses the universe, it makes that very future the only possible outcome. 

Paul then sees one outcome (which I wont spoil) - an apocalyptic event triggered by his Jihad. To stop that, he has two options : abdicate and leave all the problems to his children or do a certain ritual severely hinted at since book 1 and become a God-Emperor (tyrannical ruler) for tens of thousands of years.

The God Emperor path is living hell for Paul, and being the weak-willed character he is, he chooses the easy way out and abdicates. Much of the later books is basically his children cleaning up after his shit.",SevereBet6785,2024-02-18T05:38:27Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2

> Truly, this is rearing up to be one of the greatest battles in fiction.

The battle isn't the point. It never was. The entire set-up is the moving of chess pieces into place for the actual climax, which is the duel between Paul and Feyd. Neither was supposed to be the culmination of the Bene Gesserit breeding program, but it's noted a few different ways that *either* could *conceivably* have been the Kwisatz Haderach. One more generation of the plan was supposed to be the *for sure* messiah, but Jessica made that impossible. The fate and future that Paul sees is murky at this critical hinge point, where it could all end, or could all progress exactly as he has seen it unfold. The outcome of the duel between two near messiahs cannot be foretold, and the entire breeding program and fate of humanity hangs in the balance: the death of Paul ends the breeding program forever and humanity stagnates as foretold by the Bene Gesserit, or Feyd dies and humanity must walk the path of the Kwisatz Haderach who should not yet be.

Herbert never once focused on 'battles' save as backdrops for character building, and the entire book eschews grand battles. It always laser focuses on the characters, the politics, the statecraft, the power structures at play. Any large battle of any sort is glossed over to focus on the import the battle has on the main characters involved. He does this by design.

> Baron Harkonnen is killed by Alia, a character who has no motivation to kill the man

Alia has the genetic memories of her entire genetic line, include the feelings, thoughts, experiences, and motivations of her mother. She absolutely has motivation to kill the man who simultaneously killed her father she never knew/husband she knows intimately through Jessica's genetic memory/every Atreides who has ever been in her lineage that also hates Harkonnen.

> as opposed to Paul, Gurney Halleck, or Thufir Hawat who all deserve revenge against him

Is that how stories work? Like, only the most deserving of revenge can kill antagonists? How boring. Harkonnen is brought down by a child. An ignoble death at the hands of a toddler who outwits one of the greatest schemers of the entire book.

> Rabban Harkonnen, governor of Arrakis, is also killed off-screen, which removes the possibility for an epic final battle between him and Halleck.

So you just want an Avengers movie or Game of Thrones, then, huh?

> His plotline about being a reasonable and kind leader in order to prevent jihad?

His plotline was never this. It was always simply breaking down the power of the empire, and it serves as a metaphor. He who controls the spice (oil) controls the empire (world). 

Beyond this, the inevitability of the Jihad that marches forth ahead of him is out of his control. He has lots of visions about it, lots of conversations about his fear of it, of how it will happen no matter what but maybe he can control it. His rise to power within the Fremen follows religious themes, and the violence that will spread across the universe is inevitable. Those become themes for future books, but they are still present in this one. Dune is a complete work.

> Paul became a full-on Mary Sue at the end of this book.

Yes. He's literally the messiah. But this is also why the fight with Feyd is so important. It is the true moment of birth for the Kwisatz Haderach, the freeing of the messiah. This is the moment he cannot predict, and therefor the moment where his fate is not entirely out of his control. That's why it's the climax. It wasn't an ego duel, it was all of the power structures in this universe coming together and *all* of them hoping to control the outcome. It is the only moment of the book after Paul consumes the spice essence where he cannot see the future, and thus is not bound to it.

There was never going to be a big epic battle scene. This book is not a space opera, it's not about combat, it's not about parceling out revenge by those most deserving to those most earned, and it's not about ensuring satisfying character arcs (spoiler: none of them are satisfying). The entire book is the moving of chess pieces into place, and the final move to mate is whoever wins a duel between two competing messianic / near messianic products of thousands of years of political scheming.",happy_and_angry,2024-02-18T17:11:16Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,11

*That said*, I am with you on just finding the book unsatisfying, and I want to push back against a lot of the people that are posting about how ""a big battle was never the point,"" and so on. *Dune* is extremely influential and pretty much a game-changer when it comes to sci-fi—as others have said, it has extremely elaborate and inspiring world-building *and* it's something of a direct critique of pulpy sci-fi and early-to-mid-20th-century adventure stories that pretty much always glorify and prioritize the stories of colonial powers, ignoring native peoples (or, in the case of much sci-fi, aliens) or using them as window dressing to tell a big, bombastic, save-the-space-princess-type story. It has cast an extremely long shadow—its influence is undeniable, and frankly, I think it's worth reading *even if it's not your (or my) cup of tea*.

And it's not. I don't like this book at all, for many of the same reasons you said, but I think one of the things it really comes down to is that I deeply dislike Herbert's *pacing*. The book alternates between hyperfocus and hand-wave or time-skip in extremely jarring and, *in my opinion*, ineffective or distracting ways. The introduction to the book is *mostly* a plodding, jargon-laden semi-internal monologue with overwhelms us with detail: detail of the setting, of the characters, of the *literal architecture of the palace halls and rooms*, of the minutiae of character interaction and background relationships between all of these House Atreides nobles and officials... and then we just get a jump to a different place where we get a similar thing, but from the perspectives of antagonists. And then we get *the same thing again* on Arrakis, as everyone's settling in to the palace. There's an actual scene of Duke Leto being like... a leader and stuff with the sandworm and the spice harvester, and then we go back to the palace to sit around and learn about the minutiae of everyday life and the various people who live there.

And then 99% of those characters die, basically off-screen, in the course of ~3 pages.

And then we get *more* sitting around with inner monologues while we learn about the minutiae of Fremen life. And so on, and so on.

I have *never* understood the book's pacing nor its obsession with giving us swathes of information and backstory about things that ultimately *do not matter at all*. Paul's combat training in the opening sequence tells us massive amounts of detail about his relationships with Thufir, Gurney, and Duncan, but they don't actually *convey* that he's a capable fighter except to *state* that he is. Herbert is absolutely obsessed with *showing* instead of telling, but only about maybe 50% of the things in the novel, and in the end, the things he *tells* us about instead of *showing* us are the things that matter the most, and most of the things he *shows* us are effectively window-dressing.

The only thing I'm surprised about is that you were actually gripped/motivated by the novel *until* that ending—Herbert does this sort of thing repeatedly throughout the novel, so when I got to the end and it effectively said, ""And then stuff happened the way he figured it would because it was set up to happen that way and couldn't happen any other way,"" I was like, ""Oh, again? Sure, whatever."" I think I realized I didn't like the book about ~1/3 of the way through and just powered to the end, so power to you for actually being captivated most of the way through.

As to the critique people have levied that the ""battle was never the point"" and thus it obviously wouldn't be written out... there are other novels that have battles that ""aren't the point"" which still give us *some sense of the battle*. For example, *The Hobbit* has all sorts of stuff in it about how greed and short-sightedness and stubbornness lead to war, about the stupidity and insanity and chaos of war, *and* Bilbo very famously just... runs and hides during the battle... yet it still gives us a chapter about the war. Given that *Dune* is about how dangerous messianic figures and hero worship are (among other things), it would be wholly appropriate to have a big, epic battle play out *followed by Paul being overtly horrifying*—make the reader really stick with him through a classic sci-fi battle sequence only to remind them that, yes, they are cheering for a monster. I think that would be effective. It's effective elsewhere.

I think Herbert didn't write that because, as above, Herbert's choices of what to focus on throughout the book are baffling. 

When something ultimately doesn't matter very much, it gets a sizeable stretch of text. When what he's writing about is an *idea* that's relevant to the story, he belabors the point even more. But when it's anything to do with characters having external interactions (from character-developing conversations to straight-up action sequences), it's either an expository info-dump or it's rushed through as quickly as possible so he can get back to detailing minutiae or rerunning Paul's internal monologue.

It's ironically extremely similar to *The Fellowship of the Ring* (which Herbert might have found quite insulting) in this way: we get a massive amount of focus on *setup*, pages dedicated to irrelevant pace-breaking things (see: Tom Bombadil), and then extremely short, light-on-detail run-throughs of *actual events*.

We can all argue day in and day out whether ""that's the point!"" or it's bad writing or it's just a question of taste, but I do genuinely think that Herbert could have made his point *better* had he had a different writing style. I think the criticism that the book is deeply anticlimactic is a totally fair one, and it's only *partly* due to it being essentially only part of the full story. I *personally* also just find following Paul through his story to be brutally boring—I am not fascinated nor captivated by being stuck with a guy who just relitigates his own destiny in his own mind for a hundred pages and feels real bad about it. I understand the *point* Herbert is making, but reading it in this book (and the subsequent books) isn't very interesting to me. Having the concept of predetermination and the burden of prophecy narrated at me is not my idea of compelling storytelling.",nova_cat,2024-02-18T20:58:47Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,13

With that added perspective, the ending isn't as bad for me.

>*Dune,* however, failed to be a criticism that I found to be interesting.  Paul just automatically succeeded in all of his endeavors. 

I think the point is that he doesn't really succeed, though. Paul is fundamentally a decent person, and his motives are generally relatively sound (vengeance against the comic book villains who murdered his family, overthrowing a tyrannical dictator). Then he identifies about halfway through the first book that he's on course to cause a terrible humanity-wide catastrophe, and despite trying to avoid it he absolutely can't. His story is one of abject failure to achieve his biggest goal.

The second book really hammers his failure as a person home. It's a melancholy book where he is miserable about the horrors he's unleashed and despondent about his inability to change it, but also it takes the theme further as he realises that something ""must be done"" to save future humanity, and he's not got it in him to do it. He fights and struggles to find a different path, but ultimately doesn't.

As for the ending happening too fast, I think that's kind of the point of not just the ending but the entire series. Events lead to events and the entire process gathers momentum until it is inevitable. At its heart Dune isn't a story about Paul Atreides or the Emperor or any of the factions or any of the protagonists of the later novels.

But again, that's the point. You're *supposed* to go from rooting for Paul to looking on with horror at what he's wrought. At what point does Paul turn bad? Herbert wanted the reader to examine their own worldview as it relates to conflicts in the middle east. The whole thing is an allegory for the proxy wars we were fighting against the Soviets there, and he accurately predicted that our interference would destabilize the region and lead to endless conflict.


>However, I had to learn that from other readers, rather than being hinted at that from the book itself.


It's absolutely hinted at in the book itself. It's more than hinted at. The jihad is perhaps Paul's most persistent vision throughout the entire book. The book repeatedly calls attention to potential inflection points where Paul could abandon power, abandon revenge, and prevent the Jihad. It's true, it's not until the sequel that you see the full implications of the Jihad, but the first book is not shy about beating that warning drum.


>However, I still stand by my point that I feel the ending of this book did not fully communicate to me everything it set out to communicate


I will freely confess that Dune is *dense*. It has layer upon layer of nuance that you might not catch in a single read. I just went to emphasize that it's all there though. There's a reason it was so highly praised when it was first published, even without the sequel. It has an insane amount of depth. You just have to be paying attention to all the moving parts.


Basically, I encourage you to read Herbert while remembering that he is a critically acclaimed sci-fi author, and consider that maybe the things you think are missing from the book are actually just things that you, personally missed. You could argue that it should be easier to parse those critical details, but in my opinion the subtlety is exactly what makes for a satisfying 'aha' moment when the pieces start coming together.",Solesaver,2024-02-18T09:11:25Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,27

DUNE I read last year and still feels fresh and unique, and love the others. DUNE is a great standalone story, and if you want you can continue and finish with Messiah if you don’t want to delve into the too weird territory and just stick with Paul (which is probably why the new movies will be a trilogy of the first book split in two and messiah )

xjbzd8_26,xjbzd8,"It's godawful. Like there's not a single person who will defend the writing decisions. 

At the end of Dune 6, it is actually a cliffhanger ending the characters are basically in an alternate dimension after Duncan Idaho Ghoula number 4765 or so pokes the bear with this mysterious couple at the edge of humanity. What the God Emperor did is so monstrous it's beyond human comprehension. He was forcing human society into the worst North Korean level nightmare times 1000 and his single goal was breed humans capable of killing him. He made exactly one and only one genetic imperative. 

Kill a Prescient dictator. Humanity after 3000 years finally evolvesv enough to kill him. 

And during the scattering which The God Emperor prohibited, humanity finally met alien life. 

The old couple. They both have the exact same powers as Paul and Leto did. And they're like what the fuck why did this creature knock on our door. What the hell is going on? 

Let's vivisect it and see how it avoids the sight. 

And of course Duncan Idaho Ghoula escapes this situation. 

But the true terror is what did humanity find, what did Paul and Leto forsee that was so bad they went along with the Golden Path?

Oddly enough the time line of the Dube universe is actually finalized in the prologue and epilogue of God Emperor which the historian is 15000 years post Leto's rule as good emperor and he says there are sightly over a million of our race left. This is the story of the God Emperor 

So whatever happened in Dune universe, 15000 years later there's less than 1 million humans leftv after Paul's Jojad killed Trillions.",MaimedJester,2022-09-20T21:30:59Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,26

I'm currently reading God Emperor of Dune and find it be a pretty easy read compared to earlier books in the series, but that might be because I'm already familiar with the world building by this point.

Tolkien's writing is much richer and deeper, conveying the depth of understanding he had for the world and the people within it. The setting isn't bleak or alien at all, it feels vibrant and nostalgic.

Both writers excelled when it came to dialogue and conveying genuine emotion through character interaction. For Dune, the moments of sincere emotional expression stood out more to me against the bleak backdrop of Arrakis and the political struggles.

I only read two of the ones that came after. They have the occasional great idea, but they're only nominally the same series. To me they come off more like fanfic. 

If you enjoyed the first trilogy, definitely give the next three a try. There's a high likelihood you'll love them as well. They'll completely change the way you'll think about Paul and the Dune universe. 

Herbert's other books are usually excellent as well, and well worth your time. Try The Whipping Star.

I love the Lynch movie, most people don't. The visuals are great, but it misses the point of the book. Some find it confusing, but as you've read the books you shouldn't have any issues. Enjoy the spectacle, ignore the rest.

The two mini-series are relatively low budget, and it shows. But the casting is good, and it's closer to the tone of the books. It's longer, too, which helps.

The recent movie is fantastic, as Villeneuve evidently grew up with Dune, and totally gets it. It's a streamlined version, but very faithful to Herbert.

Whenever an example of science fiction or fantasy is truly great, it's disclaimed (often with convoluted, distorted, and revealingly insistent arguments) as ""not just sci-fi"" or even ""not sci-fi at all."" 

That SUCKS. It really does. It's like there's an unconscious conspiracy among the literati, to bend the definition of all so-called ""genre fiction"" to make sure it only contains trite, inconsequential pulp. Once a work is recognized as great, an almost automatic effort begins: if you're going to discuss something *as a great work*, you must start coming up with ways to ""elevate"" it beyond the lowly genre trash. EDIT: This disclaiming is sometimes completely transparent, along the lines of ""X is SO GOOD that it's not even sci-fi anymore! It's, like, real *literature!*"" As if it's just accepted that a certain level of quality compels a work (and, more importantly, the work's author) to be ""graduated"" out of the adolescent pit of ""genre fiction,"" and into the shining light of ""literary fiction.""

I also realize that there is a counter-urge: that of the ardent sci-fi fan wanting to specifically claim and include great works like Dune as ""sci-fi and ONLY sci-fi,"" but I think you can understand that, as a reaction.

In GEOD, Herbert dares to try to show us the thoughts of a literal non-human god....and does an incredibly good job of it.  It shows how smart and/or thoughtful he was to be able to achieve this without holding Leto back to his OWN limits.

>Reverend Mother Syaksa has proposed a theoretical explanation for this trend, a theory which many of us are beginning to share. RM Syaksa attributes to Lord Leto a motive based on the concept of hydraulic despotism. As you know, hydraulic despotism is possible only when a substance or condition upon which life in general absolutely depends can be controlled by a relatively small and centralized force. The concept of hydraulic despotism originated when the flow of irrigation water increased local human populations to a demand level of absolute dependence. When the water was shut off, people died in large numbers.

>***This phenomenon has been repeated many times in human history, not only with water and the products of arable land, but with hydrocarbon fuels such as petroleum and coal which were controlled through pipelines and other distribution networks. At one time, when distribution of electricity was only through complicated mazes of lines strung across the landscape, even this energy resource fell into the role of a hydraulic despotism substance.***  
>  
>RM Syaksa proposes that the Lord Leto is building the Empire toward an even greater dependence upon melange. It is worth noting that the aging process can be called a disease for which melange is the specific treatment, although not a cure. RM Syaksa proposes that the Lord Leto may even go so far as introducing a new disease which can only be suppressed by melange. Although this may appear farfetched, it should not be discarded out of hand. Stranger things have happened, and we should not overlook the role of syphilis in early human history.

Even in 1965 it must have been very shocking and subversive to have the protagonist go on a jihad. It was surely a fascinating provocation, for a Western readership, to steep the universe of this future in the language of Islam. I don't think it was at all an ""obvious"" thing to do.

Then there is the ecology and environmental side of the novel; we are accustomed to speak of ecological factors in our analysis of history, but this perspective was certainly not so commonplace in 1965.

However, while I haven’t totally grokked the entire essay (I only read the first part because I haven’t read the other Dune books and I didn’t want spoilers), I think that he was saying that didn’t really explain it anyway, because the poverty on Arrakis was primarily driven by bad institutions, and the rulers keeping it poor/dry when they didn’t have to.

The back story of the resistance was weak as hell, and didn't feel the weigh of it in the world building. The only thing that was well made was the fact that Ryan's character felt like a detective, but it didn't matter, because the movie holds your hand for you to don't feel lost in the not at all complicated plot.

The only scene that felt fully lived in to me was the food court thing.

I would also agree that Wallace's motivation felt weak and a little contrived but the god complex is not really that unusual - perhaps just dated?

On the fence about some of the female characterisation... Thought some was good and some was not so good.

Loved the pace and thought the movie could actually have stood to be a few minutes longer. The ending felt rushed is about the worst I would say about that. 

Thought the score was powerful and slightly bombastic but didn't go too far.

31xrmi_2,31xrmi,"I've been waiting for the periodic Dune thread because I've been thinking about the Sci-Fi aspects of Dune very in depth. When I was reading Dune, I didn't really see it as Sci-Fi as much as I saw it as fantasy, but recently my opinion changed.

Dune was written in 1965, so if the technology displayed in Dune isn't all that impressive, it's because we've grown so much since the 60s in technology. Interestingly, Frank Herbert wrote a great justification for why tech isn't so impressive in his book with the Butlerian Jihad. The Butlerian Jihad was a campaign to destroy technology that would think as humans do. The technology in Dune therefore is of an entirely different nature.

What has been advanced in Herbert's vision of the future is disciplinary schools. He imagined the Mentats, a school of thought that allows its' students to think computationally, and the Mentat characters often deliver the most valuable assessments of a situation.

There's also the Prana Bindu muscle training. Herbert imagined we'd have a school that teaches it's students how to wiggle the little toe of their foot without moving any other muscle. 

He has so many other types of trainings: the Weirding way of combat, the Bene Gesserit use of Voice, the Atreides' Battle Language, I'm just so impressed and so fascinated by the brilliance of the novel.

The only piece that I can't allow to be Sci-Fi and have to insist is Fantasy is the ability of Prescience. Even though it's fantasy, it's still believable, and with this ability, Frank Herbert is able to convey some of the most beautiful philosophies I've come across since I started enjoying novels. If you're afraid to continue after Dune, you may miss out on some of the best of the ideas.

These books make me incredibly passionate, and I feel very fortunate that I've still only just finished 3 out of 6 of them. Next I have God Emperor of Dune, and I hear that this one is a real killer.

The Beyonders, a large fleet of space marauders originating on the fringes of the galaxy, have cut the system of Nasqueron's star (Ulubis) off from the rest of Mercatoria civilization by destroying its portal (the only means of faster than light travel), and the local Mercatoria adherents await the delivery of a wormhole connection from a neighboring system via sub-lightspeed travel.

31xrmi_16,31xrmi,"Dune is one of my all-time top five favorite books.

There are a couple ways you can go now. You can read everything with ""Dune"" in the title, you can only read sequels, you can only read prequels, or you can just stick where you're at.

If you go with the sequels: there's a lot of variance there. Herbert's sequels to the books are INTERESTING, but I don't think any of them are as good as the first one, and around book 3 or so they start to get really, really fuh-REAKY. Still, if you enjoyed the headier bits of Dune, they're worth a shot, but bear in mind they are not easy reads. I liked them, didn't love them.

If you go with the various prequel novels written by Brian Herbert and KJA: this is probably heretical in some circles, but I actually like some of these books a lot. They're not great by any stretch. They are not Dune. They're not even the same KIND of book. But Dune is so good that I think there's room for lots of different stories under the umbrella. 

I look at the prequel novels as more of a Dune Expanded Universe a la Star Wars. They are not extraordinary literature by any stretch, and the ideas are not as ""whooaaaaaaa"" as the original but they are damned entertaining. The main thing these books have going for them - both the Legends and Prequel trilogies - is that they have tons of great characters you really get interested and invested in. And every now and then there is a serious moment of awesome. If you read The Butlerian Jihad and you don't get all goosebumpey when Xavier Harkonnen says ""it's the only way"" then, I dunno, maybe you're a replicant.

31xrmi_58,31xrmi,"In my opinion, the prescience in Dune is not mystical, it is a natural conclusion of Paul's combined abilities. 

I once had a teacher tell me that physics is a way to predict the future. By knowing somethings speed and position we can predicts where it will be. The same applies to more complex systems. If they follow rules, their outcomes can be predicted. The farther out we try and predict, the more variables we need to consider in order to be somewhat accurate (entropy). You and I don't have to capacity to understand them, so they seem random.  

Paul's prescience comes from his combined abilities as a Mentat and a male Bene Gesserit. His ancestral memory and perfect empathy gives him all of the data he needs to allow his Mentat abilities (perfect logic) to make predictions so far into the future that it appears he knows the future to the end of time. Rather, he balances probabilities and directs the course of humanity to avoid certain unavoidable eventualities. Conflict arises when other prescients attempt to influence the ultimate destiny of humanity. Paul understands this and sees that prescience will destroy humanity. 

Paul's Golden path ensures that humanity is scattered so far that sheer distance prevents any one force from being able to influence humanity as a whole, thus guaranteeing its continued survival and independence.",mpobers,2015-04-09T03:01:05Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,58

31xrmi_60,31xrmi,"Honestly I don't see it as Sci-Fi or Fantasy, while elements of the universe that it is based in, easily draw parallels with either. I saw it as a fictional Political Thriller, weird I know.

As the series goes on it becomes more entrenched in Sci-Fi, however I rarely read past/including book 4, I love ending the series at book 4 and the final days of Leto the God-Emperor.

And the reason I use Political Thriller, is the focus of control of peoples and government though you can't really relate it to the politics of today. Also while having sci-fi/fantasy elements (Prana Bindu, Battle Language, Weirding, Bene Tleilax technologies etc...) I always felt they were more about developing the readers image of the universe that the story is entailed in, nothing is ever explained in detail as the he doesn't want to focus on the sci-fi nitty picky and instead on the politics and minds of the people in the story.

31xrmi_68,31xrmi,"Yes, you should read Dune.  You should also forget you ever saw the movie, or at the very least convince yourself that garbage was actually about something completely different than Dune (because basically it was; fuck that terrible movie).  The mini-series that Sci-fi did was astronomically better, but still doesn't compare to the book.  The Dune sequels get a lot of hate, but I actually loved them.  Books 2 and 3 are probably the weakest (but still decent, imo) in the series, which sucks since you'll have just come off the masterpiece of the first book, but trust me: keep reading.  Some amazing stuff goes down in Heretics and Chapterhouse.

After those, you may be tempted to read Hunters and Sandworms (the books by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson that wrap up Frank's story lines; essentially what would have been Dune book 7 from Frank).  Don't do it yet.  Go back to the prequels from Herbert and Anderson, read the 3 Prelude books (House Atreides, House Harkonnen, and House Corrino) and the 3 Legends books (The Butlerian Jihad, The Machine Crusade, and The Battle of Corrin).  Doesn't matter which trilogy you do first, just read them in the right order within each one.  You'll have a much better understanding of how things got to where they were in the beginning of book 1, what some of the things that get mentioned a lot mean, etc.  You'll also likely have a lot of ideas about some of the mysterious stuff in the original story line.  Now go and read Hunters and Sandworms for the epic conclusion and see if your theories were correct.  Last step: wait a couple years, get the itch to re-read the whole thing (it's unavoidable, just embrace it), and go back through it in whatever order makes sense to you.

Man, now I've got the urge to do another re-read of the series.  As someone in another comment wrote, every time you read it you'll discover something new.  Dune is without a doubt one of the best sci-fi series ever written.",tholgare,2015-04-09T12:49:27Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,68

31xrmi_93,31xrmi,"The sequels, while not as good as the original, aren't that bad.  The problem is that after Frank Herbert died, his son Brian got his unfinished manuscript for the last book and got together with Kevin J Anderson to write the final book.  You say that doesn't sound like a problem?  Well, after they wrote the sequel they then decided to write a crap ton of prequels.  They are well written books, but they blatantly change history just to tell stories.  As an example, in Dune, Paul Atreides leaves Caladan for the first time ever to go Arakis.  Well in one of the prequels they decide to tell the story of how Paul Atreides when he was a couple of years younger went off to live on Ix for a while.  It was a good story but it doesn't make any sense to tell this story.  In Dune, it was in a private conversation with Paul and his father that we learn he'd never left Arakis.  The wonder of leaving the planet and getting to ride on a guild highliner for the first time was the tool used to explain about space flight/travel. 

I like to think of the prequels as really well written fan fiction and not canon. ",DodgeGuyDave,2015-04-09T08:30:06Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,93

The only other Sci-Fi series that I really enjoyed recently was the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov (I read only the first three), which makes predictions on how society may advance through the generations. Similarly to Dune, there's a character in the beginning who makes predictions on how society will grow, and what it will need to survive. The novels unravel the influence of one man among the many to come hundreds of years after.

My other recent books that were thought provoking were of a different genre than Dune, and don't include such heavy aspects of adventure, action, and suspense, so they may not be as enjoyable.",quiversound,2015-04-09T03:59:32Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,95

I tried in my teens and not a chance, tried again in my 20s still no, tried again in my 30s and still couldn't get through the first one. Then near my 50s it all just clicked.

In the case of Dune the scope of the story is quite huge and would require much more time and chapters to elaborate what is motivating actions if it isn't just told through a subjective narrator. Also some people really like being in a character's head, especially when there are lots of intrigues and complex motivations guiding their actions.

Lots of film noir, and the crime fiction surrounding it, use first person narrative frequently.  That's what Dexter is riffing on.

One of the reasons that I'm excited for the movie is that I think Dune is a good story, and has some really nice worldbuilding, and I think Herbert's prose is the biggest obstacle to enjoying that. In this regard, I have similar feelings as I did with The Martian, another book that gets a lot of praise, and which I thought told a good story with a lot of good detail, but with pretty terrible narration (and I ended up enjoying that much more as a movie, despite being disappointed that they cut so much from the latter half of the book).

Add in the fact you've got the benegesserit, mentat, and Paul's prescience and you've got a bunch of people whose main powers happen in their brain.  So in effect, Herbert attacked it from a omniscient third person view so he could tell you more about what each of them was thinking.  I think it worked for what he was trying to do, and Dune largely falls down because of its age.  Its just not the way books are written now, but was a very different book from its contemporaries when it came out.

As a result, the novel can be very hit or miss.  If you really dislike it in writing you should try watching David Fincher's movie where he put it into the film as voice overs...  or don't.

It comes from a time when a lot of Sci-fi writers had clear deficiencies in style, but these generally make room for something exceptional to take centre stage:  for instance, no-one would claim that Arthur C.

However, Dune has deficiencies in poor characterisation, bizarre stilted conversations and internal dialogue\* that are -- to my mind -- not redeemed by any great strength.  Many will claim that the world building and scope make this book an epic, but I personally find the worldbuilding lacks coherence (eg. Bene Gesserit >!plans and skillsets seem wildly out-of-place, both in how anyone would have allowed them to exist politically or why they have much, much greater knowledge and \`magic\` skills than anyone else, and the difficulty of using prophecy+rumour as a directed tool!< ) and the scope is window dressing rather than impacting the plot in a meaningful way.  By way of comparison, more modern sci-fi like ancillary justice really lands a wide scope and detailed worldbuilding interacts significantly with the moment-to-moment plot and overall scope.

Of course, Dune has some classic ideas and lines embedded in it >!""fear is the mind killer""!< and won Hugo+Nebula, so plenty of people do like it.

\*It's not that the writing style is bad in terms grammar and sentence construction, but it is not normal human behaviour nor obviously driven by a societal difference explained in the book",turtley_different,2020-09-10T14:34:24Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,7

I also don't really get the ""show, don't tell"" thing, major strength of books as a medium compared to pretty much everything else is that you can write about things that you *can't show*, like what exactly is going on in a character's mind, their struggles, reasoning and motivation.

This is a convention, not a rule, and one held in higher regard now than historically.  That convention is of very little use to Dune in any event, because Dune is not driven by story or character but by its *setting*.  The whole point of that book is to explore the world - story and character are just convenient vehicles for exploration.  Heinlein and Asimov had similar inclinations in their own writing, and many of their books are comprised of very little other than exposition.

I personally don't care for that style of story, but will sometimes make exceptions if the world is interesting enough or if there is an intriguing enough idea being explored.  Dune is one such example in that I find the work as a whole to be fascinating in spite of the fact that I didn't actually *enjoy* reading it.

Would removing the behind the scenes power of the Bene Gesserit somehow elevate the story for you? No great houses? Just these slave owning women running a breeding program until eventually they get it right and win poliitics forever?

> I still consider Dune to be a rant on politics and religion disguised as an adventure story. I also consider the concept that a man is required extremely dated.

There's more than enough written material and discussion about his influences without having to resort to our own fanfiction. For example, I've always held the theory that Apocalypto is basically a way for Christians like Mel Gibson to sort of white wash the involvement of the Church and it's associations with monarchs to rape, pillage and genocide the new world and it's cultures, but that doesn't necessarily mean the cinematography or story are clunky.

> The entire series plot spins around the concept that a long term breeding program was necessary to create a male who could use a power used by women to bring about a golden age

I would argue a much larger issue is the interplay between prophecy and prescience and the potential to be trapped by it, and that focusing so heavily and (imo) myopically on the breeding program is a drastic munderstanding of the plot and theme of the book and it's sequels. It also just begs the question of: so what?

The problem here is twofold:

The first is that tropes aren't inherently negative or positive, they're merely descriptions of tools creators use to convey something. While tropes can be overdone, the issue with Dune >!is that is is a thorough deconstruction of the Chosen One trope. The Bene Gesserit were the ones who created the means for Paul to co-lead the Fremen and even when he does achieve it he has to break tradition and rules in order to achieve his spot. Additionally it wasn't even meant for him and it was largely his mother who is responsible for his being able to take advantage of it. Not only that, but it's explicitly stated that he has only partially succeeded at his own goal (merely the taking of Arrakis) but failed at his goal of preventing the Jihad, and he fails for personal reasons. On top of that, he's not even the chosen one spoke of in the first book and he outright admits this. Given how much of a rejection of the traditional narrative this is, why do you feel this is overdone given that I believe the overdone aspect you're referring to are the ones that play the trope straight instead of deconstructing it?!<

Also, I'd be remiss to question the anachronism of the issue: do you think it's overdone in 2020, and you're looking at all the post-1965 media like Fern Gully, Pocahontas, Avatar, Dances with Wolves and declaring it overdone, or do you feel the trope was already overdone by 1965 and it's just been piled on even worse since?",Hail_Britannia,2020-09-10T19:30:48Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,44

An inversion would be Tarzan or the Disney Jungle Books in which the tribe and circumstances of the protagonist are switched around, but it's still largely used in the traditional sense without much deviation outcome-wise.!<

>!By comparison, even though a deconstructed trope looks superficially the same, it fundamentally is played straighter than straight as a way of showcasing a flaw or problem with the trope. An example of this for Avatar would be Jake letting the prophesy go to his head, leading a genocidal campaign of his own against humans, before ruling Pandora like a dictatorial monster, wiping out tribes that refuse to go along with his rule. Granted, it doesn't have to be that extreme. This is why Dune is considered to be a deconstruction, because even though the Chosen one is invoked with Paul, the consequences are disastrous for both himself, his family, and humanity as a whole. And I freely admit that some of these aren't fully appreciated until other books, but the point is certainly made about the Jihad and what a catastrophe it would be. Dune playing the trope straight would be the first book ending with a happily ever after style ending, which isn't the case. He won, but at what cost? I really encourage you to visit the Dune subreddit and read the post(s) about Herbert's opinion on charismatic leaders. This is perhaps the strongest evidence of it being a deconstruction.!<

>!Hopefully that explains why I view it as playing both sides. I almost want to say it's objectively a deconstruction of the trope and refer you to TV tropes. Compare the end of Avatar in which it's a nice happy ending of everyone packing up off the planet with Paul's later quote about the destruction he has caused: ""I've killed sixty-one billion, sterilized ninety planets, completely demoralized five hundred others. I've wiped out the followers of forty religions...""

av5gcd_16,av5gcd,"Herbert said in later years that the whole of the series in his mind was to lay out a stark warning to those who would follow a charismatic leader.  Basically he said his whole purpose was to try to make the public see what you were writing yesterday.  :  )  He eventually started doing public speaking tours at universities to get the younger audience to see the point.

After World War Two Herbert became the chief of staff of one of the most powerful men in Congress.  A congressman who was on all of the most important oversight committees of our military and intelligence services.  He had TOTAL clearance for what was really going on, and for what really happened in Hitler's Germany and with the holocaust (most of which is still secret to this day).  Then Herbert suddenly walked away from all that power, and from his express lane to the top, and went out and worked in a backwoods newspaper.  (Once you have been briefed in on all the big secrets, they watch you for the rest of your life.)

The whole Dune series is how he processed what he had seen as the aid to that powerful man.  Through Dune, he encoded how the world really works, in a science fiction setting, where no one would even notice.  His own perverse way of telling us what is really going on.  Remember that as you read on through the whole series.

As a young man I was enthralled by the hero's story of Dune.  But I quickly came to love the second book most of all, followed by the last two the series.  (I abhor the ones written by his son.  Complete trash.  Not even good for toilet paper.  The texture is all wrong.)  You starting a great adventure. ",corathus59,2019-02-28T13:40:13Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,16

I also watched that movie again. I came to two realisations: 
1) I now understand why people didn't like the movie, it cuts out so much good content. It door of ruined the movie for me.

In this particular case, the mileage can vary all the way across the spectrum.

There are people who consider God Emperor of Dune the pinnacle of Science Fiction and their favorite book of all time. I won't go that far, but it's tough to beat when it comes to high concept Science Fiction. On the other hand, there's a *lot* of philosophizing in the book, and some people just get bored to tears by it.

I'll say this: I listened to the audiobook of God Emperor, and I think that was a good choice. I think listening to the characters go off on long philosophical speeches by a professional reader was probably better than it would have been reading it myself.

I found both the two middle books, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune, to both be really engaging books. I listened to both of them as well, though I have less of an opinion on whether that made a difference.",nairebis,2018-08-08T23:29:44Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,20

Read any other non-Dune novel written by Frank and you’ll see how weak his writing actually is.

There are a few spinoff sequels that aren't all as great, the one I'm talking about is the original Metabarons series illustrated by Juan Gimenez. It's often described as the greatest comic book ever. Pure unfiltered Jodorowsky with gorgeous obsessive illustrations. [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12123436-the-metabarons-ultimate-collection](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12123436-the-metabarons-ultimate-collection)

Edit - Also, Jodorowsky and Moebius's Incal is fantastic and was the epic science fiction book they did together not long after the Dune movie fell apart. Jodo found that in comics, he was free to pull off his incredible fantasies in a way that the film industry wouldn't risk. He's pretty much just been making mind-bogglingly interesting European pressed comic books for the last 35+ years.

Edit 2 - Just a clarification - when I say that The Metabarons is like Jodo's Dune project fulfilled, I mean that everything he wanted to achieve in his Dune film is explored in Metabarons. As seen in the documentary ""Jodorowsky's Dune"", a lot of the most interesting things Jodo wanted to put in his Dune film aren't even from the Dune novel, but from Jodo's own imagination and obsessions. I imagine if Jodo's Dune film was actually made, it would have upset many Dune purists for the radical and disturbing ways that it departed from the novel. All that good crazy stuff he eventually got to use in Metabarons though, along with the Dune themes that most attracted him, without being tied down by it actually being Dune.",scroam,2015-07-05T08:42:08Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,13

* In politics: how power is held and maintained; whether peace in the long term justifies intense suffering now; whether peace and security justify restrictive (or fascistic) policies.
* Meditation on the ""perfect"" or ideal human being, and whether the existence of such a person would be a tragedy or a triumph. Additionally, whether such a person's existence might justify or even mandate the oppression of other by that person.

There are a lot I'm missing. And I'm sure for a lot of these he's the popularizer or the first to do it well, rather than the originator.

Also, I think (and someone correct me if I'm wrong) Herbert is the first popular-fiction author to make any meaningful use of the word ""ecology"" in his work.

At the time of it's publication, *Dune*'s Islamic influences were interesting because of the relative lack of importance of the Middle East in popular consciousness, and because of his departure from a very Eurocentric tendency in previous writers.

There were local militant Arab groups that wanted all foreigners out of their country, and they fought jihad against England, France and USA. This is not new, it has been happening since the early 20th century. Since the oil in that region is the power to control the world, the colonial powers feared losing it, and also feared that their enemies might get it. That is the basis for the book. The author didn't make that up, it is history and at that time it was current events.

The author takes that current situation and extrapolates off it it... what if one of the leaders of the colonial powers became allied with the local people and lead a rebellion against the whole system? Jihad was already happening. What if it went from a cold war of subterfuge to a hot war of open rebellion?

That is Dune.

You have to realize that a lot of the fiction books come from the political environment of their times. You are not aware of the history involved, and it helps to know those things if you want to understand where the author is coming from, where he got the ideas.

It’s much more intellectual than a lot of people realize. 

It will help to read Dune Messiah to get more of a complete story. Paul is not a hero and he was never intended to be.

However whatever the intent of the author was the text is the text and we are free to read it without taking into account what the author meant to do. 

I, and many other people, might have missed the point. Or maybe the point is not made well and the book’s text says the opposite of what the intention was.

iwp8gc_4,iwp8gc,"Dune is probably one of my all-time favorite books. I've read it more times than any other book in my library.

That being said, if you don't like it or aren't getting much out of it, put it down and try to find something you like better. Different people like different things. What some people like, others won't. I'm a big advocate of abandoning a book, show, movie or any medium that you aren't enjoying, rather than plowing through it out of spite or because you feel like you need to experience what others say is great.

If you want to get a basic grasp of what Dune is all about and don't want to spend 21 hours of audiobook time digesting it all, the SciFi Channel did a miniseries called Frank Herbert's Dune that's a decent (if not a little low-budget) adaptation of the novel. It's more faithful to the story and characters than David Lynch's 1984 film. Or just wait for Denis Villeneuve's film to come out in December. From the trailers, it looks pretty awesome.

But if you're not enjoying Dune or don't like Herbert's writing style, it's okay to not read something, even if ""everyone"" else raves about it. There should be no sense of failure or missing out by dropping a book you're not liking. If you start a meal that you really don't like the taste of, it's not considered failure to stop eating it because it's not enjoyable, even if it's a popular dish.",super_ag,2020-09-21T02:17:41Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,4

iwp8gc_20,iwp8gc,"I just finished Dune, and, in my opinion, it wasn't worth reading. It's definitely poorly refined word salad, and the world isn't nearly as fleshed out as some make it seem (at least in this first book). The writing is not great either; characters will completely change seemingly out of left field, with no real explanation as to how they developed so quickly. 

At first I thought I just wasn't comprehending it to the extent that I would have liked, but I have had to read classical philosophy like aristotle and xenophon for classes, and read Steven Erikson and Pynchon for fun, so I realized comprehension wasn't the problem. Things are extremely surface level with exposition, and then there are worldbuilding terms that don't bear immediate importance, are never referenced again, and require the glossary in the back of the book to understand. Other series I have read, both sci-fi and fantasy, have explained unique concepts or lore in their established worlds within a given context to make it feel natural and without exposition, such as Old Nan's use in ASOIAF. 

There are two caveats to my criticisms though:

1. I've only read the first book. I get some things may be RAFO, but with people saying the first book is the best, and the second and third are slogs, there's no way it would be worth reading if I thought the first was a slog.
2. *At the time of release* I would have love this book. So many franchises or sci-fi stories and have taken concepts from Dune and refined them for a better product. Referencing GRRM again, *Dying of the Light* took many of ""stranger on a foreign wasteland planet with different cultures"" elements and gave it more life, and I thought Darujhistan in *Gardens of the Moon* built up the ""great city"" concept more.

k5as5u_1,k5as5u,"He captured something special in this book.

What's special about the first book that separates it from everything else, even the sequels, is the feeling of someone small (Paul) being caught between tremendous forces. It's not the particulars of his writing style, which is workmanlike, it's about the big artistic and narrative decisions Herbert made.

It's the greatest example of this kind of narrative. Basically his genius is in telling the reader upfront Leto is doomed to die and Paul and Jessica know it and are helpless, that the traitor is already positioned and that the Harkonnens have Yueh by the absolute balls.

I think the sequels are not as powerful because the stories are not as elemental, and Herbert can only tell this narrative he had instinctive mastery over once. It's like a lightning in the bottle moment in literature.

He was so ahead of his time in terms of storytelling, compared to the genre authors now, who would write this by making it all a mystery or something that wasn't a foregone conclusion. Dune written by these second rate authors in the 2000s onwards would be about uncovering the conspiracy or 'omg who the hell is the traitor?!' If you're a writer in science fiction this is a perfect example of how ideas can trump form. He is not a master prose stylist but he is able to harness the drama inherent in Macbeth or Hamlet and that's why we're devotees of his book.

And in a larger sense, that's what we're paying for when we buy these big powerful books. We're buying these writers' ability to distill the even earlier classics, like Shakespeare, Sophocles, Gibbons, into a more modern representation with their own nuances and ideas. So Herbert has his unique vision of Dune the planet and setting and all that, of exploring the dangers of messianic and deifying heroes, but it's backed up with the wealth of his familiarity with classic tragedies and application of modern understanding of heroic characters from Campbell's writings.",BannerlordAdmirer,2020-12-02T15:48:34Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

I really enjoy to see what the characters attempt to make happen, then see what actually happens as a result of their action.

The way the books are written has so much depth, or I was so young and inexperienced, that at each read I would discover or understand new aspects of the book, the story, the facts.

k5as5u_14,k5as5u,"I hadn’t realized this until reading your comment, so I’m glad you called attention to Herbert‘s choice to inform the reader of fated events upfront. You’re right that he draws on classic narrative styles, but I’m starting to think this was a necessity for this story to work. 

There’s a strong parallel between the reader and Paul‘s experience with prescience (especially his path in Messiah.) We’re presented with a few key events of the future. We don’t know the context or the details, and we want to avoid these fates. But the more we read, the more we uncover, the more we make what we fear inevitable. 

We cheer on the Duke’s survival, hoping for some miracle to occur or for Paul to make a genius play to save his father. But he dies nonetheless, as we knew he would. If not for that experience as a reader, I wonder how differently we might interpret the curse of Paul‘s prescience. 

I like to think Herbert thought of himself as trained in the Bene Gesserit ways, and his very deliberate writing is his implementation of the Voice. I’m only part way though Children of Dune, but I’m realizing that the more I relax and try to read passively, the more the story impacts me.",CharlestownGuy,2020-12-02T18:45:56Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,14

As for HOW it gets weird let's just say Frank taps more into the inhuman forces of the Dune universe in the latter books. Forces that have human origins, but are something greater (or perhaps lesser) than what they were- bene gesserit, bene tleilax, ix, etc- are expanded upon. 5-6 is a whole lot more action packed than the rest of the series as well.

The litany of the sci-fi canon (""Amazing Stories begat Asimov who begat Clark who begat Heinlein..."") is a gratuitous fetishization at best and a deadly cage for the genre at worst. How can sci-fi progress if everyone who enjoys it is expected to read and be inspired by the same source material? So, first of all, read what you like, period.

There are plenty of reasons to give Dune a second look but those are *my* reasons. If you didn't find a reason to keep reading, and you don't find a reason going forward, maybe the thread of your life is just not destined to intertwine with this novel and that's OK.

Herbert's writing is important to the history of sci-fi, and his ideas are part of its DNA into the future: themes of humanity and technology, epic scope, amtal rule, proto-solarpunk, political intrigue on a post-human scale...there a deep well of (to me) interesting thoughts here.

There's also a lot to dislike: colonial and racial tropes; gendered magic; ponderous, pompous prose; on-the-nose allegory, shoehorned ""hard"" sci-fi that gets tossed out for narrative necessity...

lucrut_1,lucrut,"IMO the Dune universe is the most detailed universe there is. Even pre Dune, Butlerian Jihad and The Machine Crusade were mostly written by Frank, they just weren't turned into books. Like Tolkien's Middle Earth, he had created much more of a world than what ended up in LOTR. IMO you can tell which books Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson wrote using mostly Frank's writing and when they started creating their own books from Frank's writings. The whole story from Butlerian Jihad through Sandworms of Dune is incredible and primarily Frank's writing. The House books and School books seem to be more pulled from rough notes and are lacking Frank's flow and cohesiveness.  
That being said, the books can be a challenge to get through at times. The level of detail of the environment may not be of much interest to some, the political details may turn off others, but those details make the books very re-readable. I've read them over a dozen times and get new details each time, and appreciate them more each time. But like some of LOTR, I kind of speed read through some sections.  
As I've said many times here, I highly recommend reading Frank's works outside of Dune. His entire collection of writings is incredible. The Worship and Pandora series especially.

lucrut_12,lucrut,"I actually got a bit bored with Messiah. It seemed more like the last part of the first book used more as a bridge to children of Dune, which was thoroughly captivating seeing the shift between linear thinking from the singular ego's in most humans to the expansive thoughts of one who is developing the ability to confer with the billions of ego's of his ancestors and the ability to see the patterns within patterns that lays the future bare.  
I hope you finally got into the book and didn't give up. Currently about 75% through myself and the concept that someone is so powerful that they're able to enforce a seeminly endless null state in humanity and the logevity to drive them mad with it has made this departure from the other narratives and writing that proceeded the most captivating piece in the original saga for me so far.  
Trying to guess how all the pieces fall together chapter by chapter and the implications behind his reasoning has proved endlessly fun and sometimes terrifying.  
I'm afraid though that when I finish over the next few days that the others might not meet the mark.  
So far my ranking goes, Dune/God Emperor of Dune as my favourites, followed by Children of Dune and then Messiah. I'm guessing with each fan their favourites will be slightly different.",No_Distance_4820,2023-07-20T08:09:33Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,12

I found the early 2000s prequels really interesting too (The Butlerian Jihad, The Machine Crusade and The Battle of Corrin), as they cover events that are frequently alluded to in the main series. I've yet to read the Prelude, Heroes or Great Schools series yet, but they're on my list.

sro7s1_2,sro7s1,"Only about halfway through Messiah so my opinion could drastically shift by the end. So far, I am one of the folks who preferred Dune, for a lot of reasons: I thought the plot was more interesting, the stakes felt higher, the writing was better, and the characterization was a lot better.

My main gripe about Messiah is that it HAS all of the things you mentioned, but we've barely seen these pieces set up, let alone moved. I would argue that Dune was also a bit of a slow burn, but there was intrigue at every chapter and the plot actually moved. Herbert used every idea he had, and he let us see it. To me, so much of Messiah is being told and not shown.

That being said, it's not supposed to be Dune. Frank Herbert was extremely intentional with the series, afaik, so I'm going to just enjoy Messiah for being it's own book with its own differences.",YesTomatillo,2022-02-13T21:07:41Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2
sro7s1_3,sro7s1,"I've read through CoD, and Messiah is my favorite for the reasons you said. 

I think people just go in expecting a book on the scale of Dune and then get disappointed. I went in knowing that it was more like an ending/final part of the first book rather than a new story, so my expectations were measured (and then exceeded!). I think that one is kinda fair since the scale *is* much smaller.

I've also definitely heard people say that they hated how Messiah totally subverts your expectations with Paul (since they wanted him to continue being the hero/""good guy"") but: 1) it was pretty heavily foreshadowed in the first book so idk how you wouldn't expect that and 2) I can't relate to that at all bc it's exactly why I think Messiah is so good",RedVentrata,2022-02-13T18:14:31Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,3

Picked it up a month later and did the exact same thing again. I picked it up again yesterday morning and I read from where I'd left off (chapter 5) and finished it at 4:30 am. I have never in my life read that much that quickly. Aspects of it were boring to me, but the first book had moments like that as well. These two books are just sooooo interesting to me. It is easily the most intricate and articulated fictional universe I've ever experienced.(Though admitablly, I don't read much at all.)

Some dialogues feel a bit poorly written, and it's surprisingly slow for a book that short. But since I had no clue how the book was going to end, the last couple of chapters were really powerful and pretty dark.

sro7s1_17,sro7s1,I dont understand this confusion with Dune. Paul is not a hero and he isn’t meant to be. He’s meant to serve as a warning that blind loyalty to a leadership figure can lead to disaster. Herbert didn’t want Paul to be seen as an actual hero. He was skeptical of people in power. Paul feels this “terrible purpose” within the first novel. Messiah is just him losing control of the monster he created. One of the chapter headings even says “no more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a hero.”,GringottsWizardBank,2022-02-13T18:29:14Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,17

That usually causes a plot to unfold more slowly than would be needed otherwise. If that isn't something that you are looking to read, then Dune isn't for you.

It's okay to acknowledge you aren't part of a work's target audience, and also that it isn't bad. Unfortunately, a lot of media consumers miss this. I'm not part of Dune's target audience (which is frustrating because I'm right next to it in a lot of ways,) but Dune is still a work worthy of discussion and readership.

So I would disagree about it being overhyped, though I suppose it might be better labelled today as science fantasy or space opera. Those are both part of SciFi to me though.

Is it perfect? No. I think many times Herbert had trouble putting into words the strange concepts he was trying to describe. And he did sometimes get wordy about things like the ecology. Still, I feel he managed to convey both a sweeping political epic drama and the intimate personal consequences that Paul and Team Atreides had to endure.

There's nothing typical about the style of the Dune series (or there wasn't until people copied it), and the entire narrative has some incredible twists and turns, it often goes in directions you could not predict, and the overall scope of his future is so deep and detailed - you really get your mind blown by the end with how much time has passed and the ideas he comes up with for our future.

Everything he comes up with is so original - the Mentats, the Bene Gesserit, the Tleilaxu, his FTL travel, the Spice, the sandworm's life cycle, the AI apocalypse, total rejection of advanced computers....Herbert was a genius.

Space travel may be hand waved in the novel but the ecology of Arrakis gets a ton of attention (its just that characters in the book itself ignore it to their own demise). ",madmoneymcgee,2017-04-10T13:34:12Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,6

FWIW, I started with book 2&3 and came back to 1. And loved them all.  (well the last couple in the 6 book series become very strange for me, though they had their moments;  luckily brian herbert didn't write anything)

What you think about a book often depends in large part on what you expected it to be. If you hear ""greatest science fiction novel ever"", you will probably have an idea of what that means, and if the book doesn't match that idea, it will fall short. That's OK, it doesn't mean you're missing something.

Personally, I first read *Dune* over 35 years ago, and thought it was the best science fiction novel I had ever read. That opinion hasn't changed.",agm66,2017-04-09T19:43:36Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,33

Each book is different in some way - especially book 4, The God Emperor of Dune is very different in style and substance - but all of them are moving humanity toward a goal, a goal that takes thousands of years to achieve. And the last book ends on a cliffhanger of sorts, since Herbert died before he could write what should have been the final book.

If you didn't like the first one, then I don't know what to say. I don't know what you're expecting or looking for. Messiah is dark, Children is a lot of pieces being maneuvered into place leading up to a very strange transformation. God Emperor is incredibly internal and has barely any action.

hphwj6_1,hphwj6,"So I'm writing this as someone who has read all of the original six books multiple times at different points in my life. That being said, I definitely get this, and there's nothing wrong with you. The problem is definitely the book, which is just not structured anything like most modern fantasy (and dune is fantasy, albeit with a cool ecological tilt). I also am writing this (no joke) while doing a chapter by chapter breakdown of the first book (because it interested me to examine what worked in the book)

First of all, what's very noticeable about the book is that act 1 is about 1/3 of the book. And it's full of amazing writing, full of tension, foreshadowing, character development, and worldbuilding. It's very clear that Herbert and his editor put a huge amount of effort and love into this part of the book. Every chapter is full of gold, promises waiting to be paid off, little nuggets of the complex relationships between the characters. It's all written in third person omniscient, which nobody uses anymore because it's so hard to use, and on top of that all the characters are geniuses, which should prompt some disbelief issues, but he works around it so skillfully that you believe it. But still, that's 1/3 of the book, and during act 1 basically nothing happens(I'm defining the end of act 1 as being when the metaphoric bomb goes off and everything changes) The stage is still being set.

Then you hit what I'll call act 2 (not book 2 by the internal markings, which I think is kindof confusing) at the point when all the tension that was built up over those previous 160 pages explodes into this crazy madcap escape sequence that takes up the next 200 pages of the protagonist running for his life over something like 2 days until finally he makes a new home with the fremen. There's still a decent amount of worldbuilding going on, but where the first act had almost no action, this part is nonstop action, relying on all that foreshadowing and development from act 1 so that they can run at full speed without stopping to explain anything. Herbert does toss in a few sequences from other POVs just to give the reader a break, but this section is very focused. It's also about 40 percent of the book. But it's noticeable that a good number of the characters from act 1 are dead or sidelined for almost all of this second act, and by the time you get to act 3 all those fun relationships that humanized the story are mostly irrelevant. Now, you could interpret this as an authorial decision to mirror the growing dehumanization of the protagonist, but either way, the two acts feel very different.

But then we get to act 3, and this is easily the weakest part of the book I'm guessing for most readers. By the time we get here, there is no longer any real tension left in the story. The protagonist has entered his transformation into a superbeing. The villains, having already executed their plan (successfully) no longer really present much threat and mostly just sit as a stationary target waiting to be defeated by the inevitable (the entire book having been foreshadowed within the first 20 percent). So impotent are they that a large time gap of years passing doesn't seem to change anything. And all that's really left is for the protagonist to take 130 pages to just wrap up some loose ends which at this point feel almost hollow, until the final scene which is actually a bit tense and blends everything the book has built into a fairly decent if not emotionally riveting conclusion. 

If this book were being written today, it wouldn't surprise me if an editor would require the third act be rewritten. It's clear that Herbert wrote himself into a corner of sorts by creating his protagonist as a superbeing leading an unstoppable army because that kindof makes it hard to have any real stakes or tension by that point. By the time the reader gets to 'book 3' they've seen almost all the best parts of the book as a result, and it can feel kindof like a letdown in the end. (Arguably Tolkien has the same problem, except for him it's reversed. I have still not gotten to rivendell in the fellowship because it's so boring)",terrapinninja,2020-07-11T23:14:59Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

Out of curiosity, have you read the Ender's series by Orson Scott Card? It starts with one book then branches with the sequels follow two distinct paths.

'Fantastic' world building that explains why this planet so important to the galaxy - messy, incoherent and often absent. 

The complex politics - complex how? It really is a standard ""we're rooting for this guy and this other guy is bad"" tale.

Deep lore - wordiness and depth are not the same thing. 

Characters - there's some merit here, but a lot of these characters are flat and unchanging. 

There's one chapter that I absolutely loved. It's about 2/3 pages long and if you've read it you'll surely know the one. I won't say which so as not to spoil it for anyone, but I finished that chapter thinking damn, where was this laser focus to the narrative, this wonderful introspection, this heightened imagery, in the 400 odd pages that preceded it?

I think there _is_ a great story in here, but it's buried quite well. 

It was not terrible, and many sections of it I did enjoy, or were truly memorable. For me personally however, I was surprised at how much I was left wanting by the end, despite the praise heaped on the book. 

I fully expect Villeneuve's film to be fantastic - from what I've read about their goals in updating these characters and the cuts that will be necessary to bring the narrative down to film length, I think it has great promise and am really looking forward to it.",spaceguerilla,2020-07-12T10:02:22Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,31

After I have a better idea of who the characters are, what the worlds are like, etc. there’s also a second movie called children of dune by sci-fi that basically combines messiah and children. Also 6 hrs. I have not watched the sting version. It was so garbled I couldn’t follow it and gave up. I’ve read probably a dozen dune books, and while it’s not my favorite, it is my go to for legitimate intrigue. The core 3 originals at least. Maybe try that. Watch the movie. See if finding out what happens helps you.   I will say my favorite line in the movie is when the bene gesserit mother calls Jessica “you’re a benne geserit whore!” And Alia stabs her.

The most common feeling is that Dune, the first book, is really good, and so is God Emperor, which is the fourth in the series. Messiah and Children, second and third, are readable but hard to call them good. Heretics and Chapterhouse are often ignored and we pretend God Emperor is the last bit.

Heretics and Chapterhouse are fun action science books with a fun plot around sexuality. It gets a bit hammy/schlocky at times but I like them. I’d say retrospectively the least interesting of the first 4 is actually the first, but the second is only saved by a second reading where it becomes possible to make sense of the plot.

hphwj6_66,hphwj6,I'd suggest to re-read it and then read the series up to God Emperor 'in one go'. Just keep in mind Messiah and Children are less appealing than Dune or God Emperor - manage your expectations and you'll be fine.,dr4kun,2020-07-12T16:12:32Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,66
hphwj6_67,hphwj6,"I'm not saying that you're wrong, but I would offer a counterpoint that Messiah mostly struggles under the weight of expectation and its relationship to the first book. 

As I explained in my overly long ramble about the first book that is elsewhere in this thread, I think the original dune has a sortof weak ending. Messiah is the proper ending to that story. But because it had to be the sequel, it kindof hangs there as this relatively short book that wraps up the story of the first book but also needs to stand on its own. 

This need to make the real ending into its own book creates some rough issues, but ironically I think the result is a book that in many ways does stand on its own. One could almost start the series with Messiah and then view dune as a prequel that sets up the series backstory. 

Messiah notably represents a shift in tone and worldbuilding that will carry over for the rest of the series. Where dune is fairly triumphant but with ominous overtones, the rest of the books starting with Messiah are more tragic but with optimistic overtones. Where dune is focused on this tight little struggle over just this one planet and this one family, Messiah and the books that follow open up the story and introduce the themes and tropes and worldbuilding that will carry it the rest of the way to telling a much larger story. Plus Duncan Idaho is a much more relateable protagonist because he's not a god.

That transition and the large amount of weight that Messiah has to carry as a result can, I think, explain why a person might read book 1 and then excitedly open book 2 and be sortof let down. That and the fact that the ultimate climax in Messiah feels a little unearned and out of the blue, even though the larger ending feels way more satisfying in my opinion.

If I was pointing to the weak links in the series, I would say 3 and 6. 3 feels like a very forced transitional book mostly to set up 4, and as you said it feels a bit of a retread. And while I thought 5 did a lot of fun things, 6 just feels like really lazy writing that makes no sense at points",terrapinninja,2020-07-12T12:05:28Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,67

hphwj6_69,hphwj6,"I agree that Messiah suffers from having to shift the tone and that it surprises and leaves some readers behind because of it. But I think the whole Bene Tleilaxlu plot also doesn’t help to get readers interested and deserves a majority of the blame. On first read read I was personally very confused with the Face Dancer’s actions, and I lost part of the emotional attachment I had with the characters. This might just be a personal opinion, though. I will say, of the people who I got into reading Dune, both read the first one, and didn’t make it past Messiah. 

Funnily enough 3 is my second favorite. I like that it comes back to a similar structure as 1, but with new perspective, it reimagines the original story in interesting ways. St Alia is my favorite villain of the series, and I like how the secondary characters like Duncan, Stilgar, Jessica, and Paul are better fleshed out and given more importance than the secondary characters in Dune which feels very Paul-centric.",Faradn07,2020-07-12T15:23:12Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,69

Dr. Yueh is supposed to be an incorruptible graduate of the Imperial school of unbreakable conditioning, but all it takes to corrupt him is torturing his wife. The Atredes are brought down not by careful plotting, but by underestimating how much money the harkonens  were willing to spend to destroy them.

Dune Messiah has no plot that I can tell. Nothing happens, nobody's scheming achieves anything. Nothing is accomplished, then everyone dies.

lev9jm_1,lev9jm,"Do they have the same price on the inside flap?

>How can I tell if my copy is a book club edition?

>A: The price of the book will be under $10.00 on the flap of the dust jacket. First edition books listed for $5.95, third and fourth 7.95, and so on. No first edition Dune is listed at over 10.00 on the flap. You will notice sellers on eBay trying to get away with selling a BCE copy as a later edition or first edition because of the similarities. Book Club Editions are fun to collect as they resemble the original first editions if it is priced well. BCE copies have bright RED cloth or canvas boards.

Edit: This should help too:

>Book Club Edition

>Considering the popularity of the book, I'm going to write out some of the printings of the BCE and some of this was mentioned above. BCE has a slightly resized DJ along with red boards and the DJ would say ""Book Club Edition"" on the front flap and the rear flag has ""Printed in the U.S.A"" followed by ""1681"" on the next line on the bottom. Printings for BCE are marked on the bottom left on the ""about the author"" page which itself is unnumbered but it's two pages after the last numbered page, which is page 507. The marking is called a gutter code which has a table of codes. To read the gutter code, first find the letter and match it with the table. Then match the number range to get the month. Here are some editions:

>If it shows ""47M"", that is the first printing which was in December, 1971 and it's the most valuable (you can find this at $300+)

>39P - September, 1973

>18Q - May, 1974

>33R - August, 1975

>S11 - March, 1977

>T16 - April, 1978

>W20 - May, 1981

>X15 - April, 1982

>Y49 - December, 1983 (obviously the least valuable and this is more like $50+)

fkbwyy_15,fkbwyy,"If you like Dune and want more, then Dune Messiah continues and rather cleverly subverts it into an intriguing, if quite differently-intentioned, path. However, if you read Dune Messiah, then it works best in tandem with the next book Children of Dune. I would recommend both or neither (they seem in length and intent to be one book-length sequel to Dune, though written and published as two separate books). This finishes the initial so-called Dune Trilogy and brings the immediate Paul Atreides story to a close, so stopping here is perfectly usual.

If you're really still enjoying the story and universe of Dune, then God Emperor of Dune takes a giant leap forward in time, and in ambition and complexity. It's complicated and weird and divides people. I love it, many hate it. Again, the end of this book is as good a place to stop if you like, because the next books form a series of sorts.

Heretics of Dune continues this ambition and widening of the entire saga, but is setting up the series to continue beyond this and the next book, Chapterhouse Dune, which is as far as Herbert got before he died, so while it's not exactly a cliffhanger, it's unresolved. If you've got this far, then you're going to be like a lot of people who feel compelled to read the Brian Herbert sequels/prequels/spinoffs, which is a path I've never taken, and which has mixed results for everybody.",HugoNebula,2020-03-18T11:54:46Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,15
fkbwyy_16,fkbwyy,"As a big fan of Herbert, and Dune especially, I...

Yeah. It is not a good look. To be clear, he does not come out and equate being gay with being a pedophile or inherently wrong. But he does imply it strongly enough to make it too close to comfort.

I do see the Baron as embodying tropes of Roman decadence; the gladiator fights, the weird foodstuffs, the incestuous politics of choosing an her, etc. To me, the Roman decadence is the core of the character, but it is problematic that Herbert send to have thought that being gay added to that.

(Though to get to the dynamic he wanted between the Baron and Feyd - and certain parts of Dune Messiah - he would need to be gay.)

Personally, I also dislike the gender-essentialism; that there is some deep, almost mystical essence to men and women that dictate their role not just in a radically changed future, but even metaphysically.

* I hated how it ended

* I couldn't put the second half of the book down

* It's extremely well thought out. It's like LOTR, only for sci-fi instead of fantasy. It's a fully fleshed out world that you are only seeing a part of.

frank herbert was a huge genius who, through an amazing economy of language, could introduce and impart understanding of the most complex ideas.

ill try to say a few things that havent been said on this thread already:

the first three books were written about the same time, with the second and third collecting his writing that didnt make it into the first book.  

themes in the series:

ecology



court life - aristocracy

competition over resources - economics

drugs/ human potential movement/genetics/ religion

mercantilism

there is a timeless more analytical re-telling of  t.e. lawrence that offers new generalization and depth of understanding of the arabs and europeans and the oil issue.

there are more but these are some big ones.

the rest of the series was never completed, but the page-turning quality of the writing, incl the cliffhanger-chapter ending style never seem to abate, while the author is maturing and when the themes continue to to become more complex and subtle...

also, do not go into these books expecting some genre-based hack.  what youll notice on reading his work is that herbert was pretty intellectual and was clearly proficient in a lot of different types of writing.

his son also wrote dreamer of dune, which is a very interesting biography - helpful in appreciating how such massive writing projects could be accomplished.",yourpalharvey,2011-08-08T12:45:17Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,18

jbn5x_57,jbn5x,"Hahahahahaha.

Oh dear. 

Been a while since you read it? Yes, Herbert uses reportage. But not in the fashion  you describe. 

I'll put up a countervailing opinion, for the sake of discourse. Herbert actually does an exceptional job of working inside the POV of a very wide and disparate range of characters. Far from leaving out dialogue (and reporting the effects of the dialogue) we're often drawn into the characters' internal monologue, which is used both to enhance the sense of depth for each character, and to add layers of complexity to the labyrinthine conspiracy-plot, by showing us how each character has a different view of the central events.

It's this immersion in multiple characters and use of internal monologue (thoughts) that has made the book so very hard to film. Lynch tried to keep that sense of internal monologue by having his characters stare into the middle distance while the actors read their thoughts in a stage whisper, with some reverb thrown in... and it came out pretty much as it sounds there.

It's easy to film books where everything is done in reportage, as suggested by ajslater above. However, reportage is an extremely minor part of Dune, and the book is actually an extraordinary piece of writing, particularly for its time. The fact that it remains very readable and relevant forty years after it was created puts it in a very small, very limited class of books, and it definitely deserves to be considered a classic.",John_Johnson,2011-08-07T22:15:18Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,57

Few SF universes are as detailed, damned interesting and original as Herbert's and most of those that follow owe a debt to his.

Another man with a genre spawning, meticulously imagined universe, I find Tolkien's work to be just great from a writing perspective. I just love his prose.

hld8h8_1,hld8h8,"Dune is not going to be everyone's cup of tea, and I don't think there is really anything wrong with that. That said, I think there are some deeper elements to the story that you're not considering. The book deals with several key concepts throughout, and they interleave quite a bit: the environment, hydraulic despotism, politics, religion, and the charismatic messiah.

I could write a whole essay on this, but I don't want to put in too many details to avoid spoilers. So I'll try to just sketch out what I mean.

Hydraulic despotism is the concept that sometimes there is a vital resource which one person or group can control and, in so doing, establish control over a population. Herbert plays with this pretty clearly with water on Arrakis. But he also uses the concept with the spice. To the universe as a whole, the spice is even more vital than water is on Arrakis.

The spice being so important and being a product of the environment of Arrakis, it then becomes a question of how does the environment on the planet work. Where does the spice come from, why is there no water on Arrakis, and how can anything live there (including the Fremen)?

Both the environment and hydraulic despotism tie into real world concerns. Dune was written in 1965. This was written towards the beginning of the environmental movement. Silent Spring was written only two years before. It was also ten years before the energy crisis really hit, and the dependence of civilization at that time on oil was already apparent. So the exploration of how you depend on your environment, how it shapes you, and how a product of that environment (water, spice, oil) can control you and shape national policy was pretty topical at the time.

This gets into the politics theme now. Viewed one way, the book is primarily a story about three noble houses vying for power in a feudal system but having to take into account various other powerful parties (the Landsrad, CHOAM, the Spacing Guild, and the Bene Gesserit). There are aspects here about maintaining the balance of power and the status quo, trying to survive in a dangerous game of politics, and simple lust for vengeance. It might have played out in a fairly straightforward way, except that another theme became involved: religion. What happens when a disciplined, deeply religious culture, trained to think in the long term for a goal shelters a charismatic figure seeking sanctuary from total political defeat? What happens when that charismatic figure, through training and breeding, and a manipulative mother, just happens to fit all the requirements of a promised messiah?

As for the plot holes, I won't dispute them particularly. I certainly won't try to claim that Dune is a perfect book or spectacularly written or anything like that. I just want to point out that Herbert was exploring quite a bit of ideas in the book. To be honest, one of my problems with the book is that I feel like he was trying to process too many ideas in one fairly small book. It can be difficult to see how all these things fit together in the story, even on multiple readings. Some of it really doesn't become clear until the later books.

BTW: I've completely ignored the whole prescience issue here. Partly, that's to avoid going on forever, but partly that's because I really feel like it's the later books that really address prescience, and I feel that the other ideas in Dune are really more interesting.",lorfeir,2020-07-05T01:33:01Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

I personally liked it because of how it touched on managing ecosystems in a sustainable way at a time when everyone essentially ignored climate issues (he got into this when researching how California was reclaiming/saving sand dunes by reintroducing certain plants and how big of an impact it had on the local ecosystem). Also really like his concept of how AI essentially turned on them and that humans had to fill the roles of computers, completely altering the way we progressed technologically from always inventing new machines and programs to heavily focusing on genetics, chemicals, psychology, etc., anything pertaining to humans and the furthering of their abilities.

This book isn't really for everyone though, it sets up a really interesting frame and kind of lets the reader fill it in. Some people get kicks out of this imagining and extrapolating based off of his concepts, others read it and see a frame and wonder where the content is.

I'm talking out of my ass at this point but I think the book is more for lateral thinkers than vertical thinkers.",MAD_HAMMISH,2020-07-05T03:35:02Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,6

I think I liked the worldbuilding, the sense of a whole universe out there. Some of the gender stuff was just silly and dated. In terms of “greatness”, I think it’s the worldbuilding that incorporates ecology, anthropology, history of religion, and so on — I’m not a historical expert but Dune was probably one of the earlier well-known books to do that. Lately this kind of thing tends to motivate me to read actual histories and such, which seem even more interesting.",pheisenberg,2020-07-05T18:21:24Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,7
hld8h8_8,hld8h8,"Nobody could figure out where the spice was really coming from because the Imperial Planetologist Kynes went native and was throttling any real information reaching the Emperor or whoever was running the planet at the time.

Look at the relationships Duke Leto had with his command group, vs how Baron Harkonnen related to his, and how Paul worked with Stilgar. These are all management/leadership concepts about loyalty and commitment that you can only dream of having in real life.

The conversation between Duke Leto and Paul where Paul asks why they accepted the Emperor's directive to leave their home planet and assume control of Arrakis: That's Machiavellian political fuckery at it's finest. ""Make our enemy aware we know which hand holds the knife?...we see the knife!""

For a book that was written in 1965, in a genre that was just coming into its own, Dune holds up very well against modern day scifi.

Other than the sequel, the rest of Herbert's original series work needed better editing.

hld8h8_10,hld8h8,"Frank Herbert used *Sabres of Paradise* as a framework for his story on the dangers of charismatic leaders. For world building, he is often praised for working out an entire desert ecology, including how a hidden society would actually live. Technology in *Dune* is also woven into he tapestry of the society.

For the writing itself there are several themes Herbert explored. Religion as a tool for manipulation, societal failures of men contrasted with the societal failures of women (Kynes vs. Bene Gesserit), how people respond to environment (nature v. nurture), and scarcity economics (spice as an oil allegory).

He gives the reader small tastes of what it's like to see the future by putting vague spoilers in his section opening blurbs.

For many of us, the characters resonate long after we finished. Gurney Halleck, Duncan Idaho, Stilgar... all of them live in our imagination.

The book tends to hit people one of a few ways. Many love it, some hate it (Tolkien, famously, for one), and some it leaves flat. Perhaps it's just not your thing.",SlowMovingTarget,2020-07-05T01:47:35Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,10

At first, I felt funny that the Baron alway say ""I'm hungry"" for whatever situation he is in. Kind of like me at the time (I was playing video games for whatever situation I was in). After that, I start to notice that I was the funny one.

I certainly enjoyed GoT more, but mostly because there were so many unexpected turns.

udrpva_8,udrpva,"Here are two quotes from Frank Herbert that you should read...

1)  “I wrote the Dune series because I had this idea that charismatic leaders ought to come with a warning label on their forehead: ""May be dangerous to your health."" One of the most dangerous presidents we had in this century was John Kennedy because people said ""Yes Sir Mr. Charismatic Leader what do we do next?"" and we wound up in Vietnam. And I think probably the most valuable president of this century was Richard Nixon. Because he taught us to distrust government and he did it by example.” 

and

2)""The mistakes (of leaders) are amplified by the numbers who follow them without question. Charismatic leaders tend to build up followings, power structures and these power structures tend to be taken over by people who are corruptible. I don't think that the old saw about 'power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely' is accurate: I think power attracts the corruptible.""",Dana07620,2022-04-29T03:23:07Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,8

Sure, Ghanima didn't ""do much"" in *Children of Dune* but it's not to say she wasn't important. 

>The prescience was a trap, not a liberation

This sums up a core theme for the series. We see Paul struggle with his prescience literally from book 1, but the plot is so focused on him uniting the Fremen and booting the Padishah Emporer that *Dune* ends as a ""good guy wins over bad system"" story that many readers are used to (only to find out in *Messiah* that Herbert wanted to deconstruct the hell out of it). 

Paul ultimately shares the weakness of his mother by choosing to fall in love and pursue personal happiness over the greater good, which he literally has a window in to see. He refused to follow the golden path because he didn't want to make the sacrifice- he wanted death bc he wanted to absolve himself from the responsibility and wallow in his grief.

udrpva_22,udrpva,"I think the OP hits on a point that gets dropped after Messiah.

The prescience is not perfect.

Once that thread of doubt gets woven in, the rest of the Golden Path becomes terrifying.  Really, it's only a Golden Path if it's infallible.  

Paul having a diverse range of motivations - he wants his own life, he wants others to have their own lives, he's scared of the inhuman nature of the path (particularly his role in it), *he realizes that his ability to see the future is flawed and that the stakes of the path are too great to gamble on* \- is better than just having one, and they all work together to undermine his confidence.  

Dune, Messiah, and Children all asked questions about governance.  What is good, what is best, what is bad, what is worst, how can people cooperate with divergent desires?  And with the series continuing, it feels like Leto and the Golden Path represent humanity's need for a despotic benevolent dictator.  Who will do exactly what is *needed* at all times.  This didn't feel like it was necessary in universe, and the potential for it not to be, say for the path to have been something spawned from an egotistical desire, doesn't get fleshed out.

The knight and the princess marry, have kids, live long boring lives where they stop loving each other and fight all the time, then die sad in old age.

As you deleted your original response to me, it's lucky that I saved it so I can post my reply.

This is what you originally said:

>A basic fact such as half of Arrakis is a green paradise by book 2? For someone with a talking down from the high horse asshole attitude, you seem to be remembering awfully less than you think of these books. ;)?

So here's my reply...

Basic facts like Paul's age when we meet him (15, not in his 20s). The length of time Paul rules (12 years, not decades). That he knew that Chani would die in childbirth. That Ghanima was not the surprise baby; Leto II was. That Duncan goaded Stilgar into killing him because Stilgar refused to believe that Ghanima's life was in danger and refused to take her and flee into the desert until he was forced to as the result of Duncan's death. That Gurney isn't old in Dune. That Alia is Duke Leto's daughter --- not his granddaughter as you refer to her. That Duncan and Alia are *married* not just banging each other.

And then there's how --- in describing Paul and his life --- you left out where he killed 61 billion people and sterilized 90 planets.

So you tell me how much I don't remember the basic facts of the books compared to you.

""You'd teach your grandmother to suck eggs."" Did you understand that reference when Ghani said it to Irulan? 

Because I understand that reference and that's what you'd be trying to do. I've been reading and rereading the Dune books for almost 40 years which, I'd wager, is longer than you've been alive.

This is all the answer you need to provide, friend.

Just look at how much English-language words have slid in meaning since, say, the time of Shakespeare. ""Nice"" today doesn't mean what it meant then. And that's only been 400 years.

Also consider how words, when loaned to other languages, shift in meaning, or when they have the same etymological root but are false cognates to each other. Consider these false cognates between English and Spanish:

To embarass - ""embazar"" in Spanish means to get pregnant.
To support - ""suportar"" in Spanish means to tolerate. 

In Dune, they are not speaking Arabic; they are speaking some other language which has some old Arabic loan words. A slide in meaning is to be expected.

Not to be mean, but OP's post reveals an ignorance of linguistics. In fact, his shock should be the opposite: ""wow. 20th-century Arabic words survived many millenia into the future and are still in the ballpark of their original meaning.""",niceguybadboy,2023-05-09T12:27:27Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,4

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_science\_fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_fiction)

Between the thirties and the fifties the Fiction-Magazines reigned supreme especially over Science Fiction. Many of the novels we today remember as classics had their first publication in them. 

There were about 3 important sub-genres of science fiction:

1. Technology obsessed Fiction. Asimov is here the big one of course with his Robot and Foundation series. But many other science fiction staples like ring worlds for example find their origin here. What most of these share in common is that they are more interested in exploring an interesting idea than to tell an actual story. 
2. Action Adventure. (See Flash Gordon) On the most high brow side you'd probably count H.G. Wells in the early days and name as a modern example something like the fifth element of these stories. They are indiana jones in space, action oriented, where the technology just works - don't think about it. These stories are essentially where all the modern Telepaths and most tropes you see in star wars come from. In here was a lot of basically unreadable guff produced especially in the fifties that reads like coming out of bad writing prompts. ""In a world where everyone is a mind reader ..."" and so on. These were so bad, that Asimov started his Robot series to have robot-stories that aren't about a robot uprising! Not many withstood the test of time. 
3. The Red Scare - in the fifties, shapeshifters, mind-control, deep-sleep agents, etc. were on the rise as well as highly militarized fiction like starship troopers.

&#x200B;

But in the late fifties the magazines were on decline and the market slowly consolidated.

Dune was so revolutionary, and had such a hard time getting published, not because it did a lot of new things, but because it was Science Fiction that DELETED a lot of tropes from the genre. 

The Butlerian Jihad isn't some grand invention that makes Dune super unique. It is an almost clunky way of Frank Herbert to stick a line in the sand and to say: This is not a technology story! 

The entire reason for the shield - lasgun effect is to say: This is not an Action Adventure Story!

And with the politics regressing back into feudalism he also strictly says: This is also not a Red Scare story.

Herbert aggressively replaced as many Science Fiction tropes with some kind of biological / evolutionary version as one man possibly could. 

Then he took the tropes of classic colonialist Fiction, shoved them into the far future and wrote a big allegory for the oil wars and some terrible attempts at overcoming nature he saw in governments. 

With his ""stream of consciusness"" style he used to describe the spice ecstasy he struck a nerve with other authors who at the same time began to use science fiction differently than the typical magazine fiction had. More as a backdrop, with less focus on the technology or grand adventure, to put more sociological topics such as spirituality or (gender) identity in them and to embrace surrealism. (Coinciding with a similar push in film. -> see french new wave)

&#x200B;

Dune - if not the first, was on the forefront of this dramatic shift in genre and the death of the science fiction magazine. 

When it comes to Themes, Dune itself was heavily influenced by other media, so its own influence is a bit more in the aesthetic side. You'd probably not say Star Wars directly stole the Jedi from the Bene Gesserit. Telepaths themselves appeared before Dune and the BG are just a ""Bio/evolution version"" of those, but combined with the whole religious aspect, and the ease of making others obey their will - the influence is definitely very strong here. 

The following Books: Messiah, Children and God Emperor however definitely had a lasting impact on many modern science fiction stories we know today. Central Themes of Warhammer 40k are 1to1 lofted from God Emperor.",Daihatschi,2022-06-08T14:54:10Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1
v7pbn6_2,v7pbn6,"Before Dune, a lot of science fiction was understandably concerned with technology.  The ""robots and rayguns"" pulp feel of sci-fi was very alive and well.  There was a lot of preoccupation with futurism, gadgetry, robotics, mixed with a lot of male fantasy heroics, saving the world or damsel in distress.  Now that I think of it, there is still a lot of that in Dune, but it's definitely touches upon feminism and female empowerment which would have been unusual for the time as well.

Dune took the focus off of technology (hence the Butlerian Jihad) and onto other subject matter, like ecology, psychology, humanism, religion, politics, culture and genetic engineering later on in the series.  I think in a lot of ways, Dune matured the genre past the Amazing Stories and Weird Tales era of works and elevated it.",,2022-06-08T13:28:33Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2
v7pbn6_3,v7pbn6,"My opinion.

Before Dune, most books would run with one or two major ideas.  'Foundation' had psychohistory and didn't branch off into the robots until much later.  ""The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress"" combined two big ideas, an AI and a revolution on the Moon.

He could have written an entire novel just about the Empire, or the Fremen, or the ecology of the planet.  Heck, the Sardauker or the music/drug semutta would be enough for most writers.",doowgad1,2022-06-08T13:26:27Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,3
v7pbn6_4,v7pbn6,"1- Ecology.  This (the idea that the natural world is one giant system of chemical and energy exchange, and that messing with one component will have unexpected effects on another one) was a very new and unfamiliar concept at the time, new enough that I don't even think Herbert used the word.  To judge by what contemporaries said, the book did a lot to popularize the concept though, and hippies and other back-to-nature advocates really latched on to it as a vision.

2- Society.  At the time, most sci-fi was very pedestrian in scope, and at best, put together little scenarios that were 1950s America but with one thing changed for discussion, and a new coat of paint (eg, housewives get robot helpers, but somehow never do anything with their newfound time like go to school or get a job).  Herbert went way further in making a weird and unfamiliar society, where even the words are unknown, but which still held up due to its own internal logic.  This rang true because things really just don't stay the same for that long, and additionally, a lot of the counterculture was already loudly proclaiming that you needed to imagine new ways of living, free of the past, and this was an example of doing just that.

3- Free your mind, man.  This part maybe didn't age as well as the others, but the mystical ""do a lot of mind-altering drugs and unlock your hidden potential"" concept was seriously big in the 60s (as you may have heard).  This actually also goes hand in hand with item 2, since one of the other things you were supposed to do after freeing your mind was re-imagine society (although admittedly a lot of people forgot to do that part).  *Dune* therefore really nailed the zeitgeist in that respect, and possibly even went beyond it into a cautionary note, since a lot of how Paul reshapes society is maybe not positive?

4- Post-colonialism, as you already grasped.  The easy gloss is that ""spice = oil"" and ""Arrakis = Middle-East"", but there are a lot of other elements baked in there, since apparently one of Herbert's big influences was actually a book about Caucasian princes rebelling against Russian imperialists in the 1800s (some of his Fremen jargon was actually lifted straight from there).  This was, again, a major shift from a lot (not all, but a lot) of SF at the time, which again was stuck in a very 1950s outlook of ""why shouldn't we take these resources just lying around?  The natives aren't using them, and besides, they should thank us for civilizing them!""

I'm sure other people have thoughts as well, but those are off the top of my head.",e_crabapple,2022-06-08T15:22:09Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,4
v7pbn6_5,v7pbn6,"The scope of Dune's world-building was largely unknown. While there were a variety of science universes with considerable development, that development was largely presented fait accompli. If there were ray guns in the universe, it was because the story demanded ray guns rather than there being some underlying reason for that technology to emerge and thrive.

Herbert went into considerable detail as to *why* these institutions were formed as a result of the history of his universe. Where science fiction authors were traditionally comfortable tinkering with the boundaries of hard science for their stories, Herbert was really tinkering with economics and sociology more than physics and chemistry.",ViskerRatio,2022-06-08T15:12:56Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,5
v7pbn6_6,v7pbn6,"Lots of good answers here. Particularly like the note that Dune demonstrated that SF could exist beyond a focus solely on the interactions of humans, their society and future, and technology (which many would be tempted to argue is the definition of SF!)

Also worth noting is that Dune entered the scene during the transition of SF from predominantly short stories/serials published in magazines to predominantly full-fledged novels and novel series. Partially due to this, the thematic and literary depth of Dune was somewhat ""new"" in SF. 

To be clear, while many complex and nuanced ideas had previously been explored in SF, each individual work was by necessity of length often limited in scope, focusing on some subset of ideas so they could be self-contained to some degree. Dune was able to explore complex literary ideas and topics in tandem, where different thematic elements influenced one another - and Herbert could plan character arcs and plot development tens or hundreds of thousands of words into the future to support that. This is partly what allows for Dune's overall complexity and its vibrant, eons- and galaxy-spanning worldbuilding. 

The other aspect is simply ""influence"". Dune was important for SF because of how strongly it influenced the next generation of writers.

One thing those British writers did was never really repeated - consciously integrating themselves into the continental European literary tradition (maybe underlining it by using European settings).  *Dune* didn't try that, and it never got to be a detectable tendency in American SF.

I did read *Dune* not long after it came out, but it didn't seem revolutionary and I could read other SF that was just as innovative in a fraction of the length.  Then as now I didn't think bigger meant better.",Jack-Campin,2022-06-08T19:55:14Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,8

Star War's themes of colonialism weren't from Dune either, Lucas has been rather explicit that he was interested in Vietnam and wondering if he could make the plucky rebels the good guys. Star Wars has almost nothing to do with Dune.

If there's anything it had an influence on, it was probably concerning religious zealotry in space sci-fi (Jihad) and it's focus on a precious natural resource as a source of conflict. Now it's not like those haven't been themes in other sci-fi since. But being natural themes running throughout human history, and thus the two centuries or so we've had sci-fi being ""current events"" it's not like Dune was needed to bring those things into other areas either.

Not saying it's a bad book at all, just that it's a very far cry from a major influence like the works of Burroughs, HG Wells, or Asimov.",FranticPonE,2022-06-08T23:02:45Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,10

I also found it supplements the politics with all that lovely stuff about scifi planetary ecology and how that can relate to our attitude towards nature on Earth. Kynes and his dad's story arc was one of my favourite side-plots.  
  
I still think this book stands up as one of the most uncanny and 'responsible' scifis of all. Responsible is a wobbly word choice, but I'm talking in the sense of how media like Star Wars and even Star Trek, other big hitters - they sacrifice a lot of their atmosphere for contrived, everything-just-works-out plots in the case of Wars (okay it's the Force doing it but anyway) and straight up cornyness in trek's case.

tcdop_1,tcdop,"Yes. It's complex. It's *meant* to be complex. It portrays a very old, very highly developed star-faring human society. That society has something like ten thousand years of history, and the author works hard to create the kind of densely layered and complicated social structure that reflects such a history.

It's worth the effort. If you're reading *Dune*, chances are you've already read quite a lot of young-adult and juvenile SF and Fantasy. I have nothing against Harry Potter, for example - but it's not complex. There are good guys and bad guys. Good and evil. Sure, by the end of the series some of the characters are a bit conflicted... but the bad guy is still evil, the good guy is good.

*Dune* is the place where you get to leave that simplistic stuff behind, and stretch yourself. The main character Paul starts out just trying to live up to his family standards. Then he's reduced to mere survival. Then he has to struggle to find a place in a wholly new societyl; an extremely harsh and tough society. 

Once he achieves that, he begins to be motivated by a desire for revenge, or perhaps justice. But as he discovers his own abilities, he becomes aware of just how terrifying his power can truly be, and soon he is literally forced onto a path where he must make moral decisions not just for himself, but for the entire human race.

He's not a good guy. The Emperor isn't a bad guy. Baron Harkonnen is a cunning, amoral bastard, but he's not the ultimate problem. Paul's own abilities, and his choices for the future are the ultimate problem here.

Read the book. Then re-read it. Then re-read it again, and try to see how the Bene Gesserit were working for their own ends, and what they got, and what they failed to get. Then re-read it again, and think of the story from the point of view of the Fremen. Then try again, and imagine yourself in the Emperor's position...

All that being said, I don't know if your ""reading level"" (I hate that term) is quite up to scratch to comfortably tackle Dune, based on the books you mentioned. It's an extremely complex story that delves deep into not only inter-personal relationships and technology, but economics, sociology, and politics. The novel will effectively be teaching you a lot of that as you go along, if you hadn't been exposed to the concepts it deals with beforehand. This makes it a challenging read for someone who can slice through Crime and Punishment like butter. You aren't just reading; you're learning, and learning takes time. All of that stacks right on top of the book's inherent density (details within details...). This makes it exceptionally rewarding, but also slow and difficult to read.

I would suggest you keep at it. Best case scenario, you work your way through it slowly, and your reading skills will improve and rise to the occasion. That's a valuable skill, and will prove useful throughout your life, no matter where you go or what you do. Worst case scenario, it ends up being a bit much for you right now, and that's OK. Shelf it for a while until you're ready to take another crack at it, and start over. Most 15 year old kids in the American school system would be hard pressed to understand even the surface plot arcs, and if you get through it, then congratulations on being one of the few who can. Either way, read it again in seven or eight years, and it'll probably be like reading an entirely different book. It's well worth it.",Thuraash,2012-05-08T06:42:09Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,3

Dune (and in fact the next 3 books in the series, after it) is one of those books where I had a lot of ""Hmmm, interesting.."" moments. It covers politics, power, religion, human psychology, technology, philosophy... Quite far reaching.

IMO, Dune sets the context. The story gets better and more absorbing in subsequent books of the series and culminates in ""God Emperor of the Dune"" (Book 4). Books 5 and 6 in the series are not as connected.

tcdop_18,tcdop,"The reason you are having trouble with Dune is because, as seems pretty common with a lot of sci-fi/ fantasy books, you are dropped into a completely foreign universe and left to tease out how the world works, who the characters are, and what the fuck is going on from context clues alone. 

Especially in complex books, this can leave you very bewildered and overwhelmed at the beginning. You can be hours into a book like this and still feel like you are missing something or only have the vaguest idea what is going on. It is daunting if you aren't used to it.

The best strategy is to relax, keep reading, and let all of the new information wash over you. If you don't understand every little term they use or who every minor character is, that's okay. Keep reading and absorbing the world and the main plot points. 

At a certain point you'll realize that, without your even noticing it, everything has congealed in your head and you fully understand the nuances of the world and made up terms and bits of language, and are doing just fine keeping track of all 100 minor characters. You'll have been fully sucked into the story.

Then again I played Dune 2 before reading the books. Freaking loved Dune 2 as a kid (my siblings and I even had ""time matches"" to see who could finish a level in the shortest time). Played it for *years*. So I have a love for the Atredies and Harkonnen storylines and really enjoyed the backstories of both houses.

Seriously, why do people ask questions like this, while they're reading a book?  If I read a sample of a book and don't like it, I don't ask others why I don't like it I just stop.   I might ask close friends with similar opinions why they like it.  But last time I asked a group of people I didn't know. I was told that the War of the Worlds is a great book, and the reason I don't like it is because it was written a long time ago and we've moved on from it.  However I was wrong for not liking it.

tcdop_37,tcdop,"That's not so easy. I know my own kids are fond of the 'Skullduggery Pleasant' series, for example, and they're a fun read. But once you start addressing greater complexity, you usually wind up with a quantum leap in the complexity of vocabulary and syntax as well. There are few authors who manage complexity of plot and character with relatively simple language. 

It's worth trying Fritz Leiber's legendary ""Swords"" books, following the adventures of rascally duo Fafhrd and The Grey Mouser. While rarely leaning to great depth, the stories are entertaining, highly character-driven, imaginative, and definitely not pinned to the usual Good v Evil dichotomy. 

The *Bartimaeus* trilogy from (IIRC) Jonathan Stroud is aimed at the YA market. Once again, the Good v Evil simplification is completely missing, and in fact, the three-book story is driven by the moral development of a young, powerful magician (in a very interesting alternate-world society) from a position of rigid certainty to a final understanding of his own error, and his sacrifice to effect restoration. 

Phillip Pullman's *Dark Materials* trilogy also works fairly well, although the ending is less satisfying than it could have been. Again, it's imaginative, character-driven, engaging, and asks questions of good versus evil, gender roles, mortality, love, and other very human concerns. 

The first five books of Roger Zelazny's landmark ""Amber"" series are excellent. Relatively quick-moving and full of high adventure, they're easy to read, but they'll keep you guessing until the end. 

Finally: for my money, once you've gone through *Dune*, it's worth picking up Mikhail Bulgakov's 1938 classic of black-humoured modern fantasy, *The Master And Margharita*. Plenty of complexity, wonderful characters, intertwining storylines that move together, meta-story work (the book written by The Master, about the meeting between Christ and Pilate, is retold in part in the text, and the ending of The Master's book is also the ending of Bulgakov's book... which is amazingly ingenious, as well as touching, and highly effective.)

v095px_3,v095px,"1. No book can ever be objectively the best. 
2. Dune became so big because in the late fifties science fiction had become quite stale and dune broke a number of usual conventions.
3. Science Fiction classics are all a bit less interested in characters and plot than modern novels. Most other SciFi of the time is super fixated on technology and how it solves problems, whereas Dune is super fixated on politics and the fantasy elements with prescience and living memories. And because these parts are so well done, Dunes fans look over the less stellar parts. 
4. Dune and all of its predecessors are actively not action books. They are books about people standing in circles and talking about grand events, not living through them. Herbert, on the scale of show vs. tell, is very far to the tell side. For that he packs his books with an enormous amounts of grandiose ideas that he tells you about, and you got to do the rest by yourself to enjoy it. People who read a chapter and then think the whole day about cool ideas and implications of the chapter really like Dune. 
5. and honestly (but people here hate reading that) Herbert kind of expects you in Dune to be already familiar with the story. As it follows colonialist fiction beat by beat, only set into a future setting. And then he glances over the stuff your already supposed to know to get to the things he finds interesting. 

&#x200B;

Many people bounce right off Dune. Thats okay. It is a bit of a special book, with many flaws but equally many wonders to find in it. The difference is between those who can accept and overlook its flaws, and those who can't. 

Messiah is usually loved by people who weren't big fans of the plot of Dune, but loved the prescience and politics side.

Dune is a book that improves upon re-reading. It's why people go back to it again and again. When you re-read it, you catch something you didn't catch before or understand something you didn't before. So much of Dune really only makes sense after you've read at least the follow-up book.

v095px_8,v095px,">It has good world-building and characterization and I can see why people like that side of it, but I suppose I just expected it to be building up to something grand as the book went on and was quite surprised to find that, after the point the movie ends, it kind of just rushes plot events.

I was struck by this on my most recent reading, too. The book is very front heavy with the plotting and then rushes through the last section of the book at a breakneck pace. I think this is due to the fact that Herbert realized the book was getting very large, especially for a sci-fi book published in the 1960s, and he decided to lop off the final act of *Dune* and put into *Dune Messiah*. 

Having read the series a couple of times I tend to think of *Dune and Dune Messiah* as one story, where the primary tension is Paul's moral struggle between using his prescience to avenge his family and the danger of becoming a tyrant. In my opinion, this is a direct commentary on the themes of the *Foundation* series, where the idea of grand societal planning through prescient forecasting is almost fetishized. 

The ending of *Dune*, with Paul ascending to the throne, is not to be seen as a grand event but more like the final plot point of a second act (think more *Empire Strikes Back* than *A New Hope*). The final ""act"" then is of Paul breaking the bonds that prescience has put upon him and walking away into the desert. The precipitating event for this is >! the death of Chani, which also completes one of the major plot points in the original book !< .

*Children of Dune* and *God Emperor of Dune* continue on the story and pick up on the plot points begun in *Messiah* but they really are not part of Paul's story (although he does play a major role). The final duology of *Heretics of Dune* and *Chapterhouse: Dune* are almost completely ancillary to the original story (no matter how hard Brian Herbert tries to create more concrete connections) but are great fun.

I would definitely say you should continue on if you found the first part of the *Dune* interesting.",MingotheBarbarian,2022-05-29T19:04:23Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,8
v095px_9,v095px,"I picked up Dune for the first time before the movie came out and I ended up putting it down for a few weeks in the middle which ended up being where the movie ended too, which is cool. It’s kind of a natural break in the story. I’ve since finished all of Frank Herbert’s Dune books and I’m now reading his biography, Dreamer of Dune, thoughtfully written by his son Brian. 

I felt like I was missing something at the end of the first book, too. I kinda hated how the series of events wrapped up at the end of the book. It was really anti-climactic for me. I think part of the hype around the book needs to be taken in context of the time it came out, the state of sci-fi in pop culture at that time and the years after.

You may find more people that specifically like these things in genre books--I don't know that many people pick up *Moby Dick* because they really want to learn about knots, whereas people definitely read Tolkien *for* the world building.

But classes I've taken and books I've read on writing science fiction and fantasy have cited both of these as examples of what *not* to do in delivering exposition. So I think they are critcised for this.

Personally, I like songs and poetry if they come at appropriate parts of the text, but prefer that encyclopedia entries be relegated to back matter, where they can be read by people interested in such things without slowing down the story.

qewsku_6,qewsku,"Victor Hugo got Les Miserables published in 1862. It was serialized and released in parts. Some of the digressions allowed the novel to be extended, and while we might consider it padding, the readers of that era who were closer to the time of the novel might have considered it interesting details ([https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/03/23/hugo-inc/](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/03/23/hugo-inc/))

This was not unique -Charles Dicken's work was serialized and so were the works of Alexander Dumas. That was the style of big popular novels of that era. It was akin to episodes of a beloved or anticipated TV show today. There is long been a tradition of delving deep into background to help flesh out a novel or give greater insight.

Interestingly Tolkien wanted all of the LoTR as 6 books to be paralleled by the Silmarillion, but for economy of publication, the first work was grouped from 6 books into three bundles (book 1-2) in The Fellowship of the Ring, (books 3-4) to The Two Towers, and (books 5-6) in The Return of the King.  

It maybe that the modern readers of Les Miserables and Moby Dick don't appreciate that the readers of that era, this was their destination TV show/movie/binge favorite so they want to enjoy and savor the details.

qewsku_22,qewsku,"I think it is pretty much just this. Most people reading LOTR or Dune and talking about it online are fans, most people reading Les Mis or Moby Dick are into classical lit (and are not diehard fans of these works, which is the important difference), and most people into classical lit are lit nerds and tend to be well read and want to objectively critique the things they read.

Certainly we do see people critiquing Dune and LOTR for these things though, they're probably the most common criticisms of those works. Actually, I probably see MORE criticism for Dune and LOTR for this when those works come up than I usually do for Moby Dick and Les Mis.

qewsku_23,qewsku,"I'm being a little dramatic saying no reason,  but it feels like they're over explaining things to the point where it's tedious. The focus on minutia feels stifling. It's the reading equivalent of watching paint dry in a small room. I think in Moby Dick he's kind of simulating the feeling of being basically isolated at sea and having to find your sanity in little things, but like, that sucks. It's why most people don't go for extended sea voyages for fun. It's effective writing,  but you have to be looking for what he's giving you.

Lotr is long, and parts could definitely feel tedious if you aren't into it as a whole, but the ""boring"" stuff is giving context to the universe, or expanding what you know about some area of the story,  so if you can get into the whole story it is eventually pretty cool. You have to kind of wade into it for it to all be good,  but you appreciate the slow stuff more as you go along. It makes for excellent re-read value.

I think what ultimately won me over on Dune, (and you pointed out some of these positives like the interplay of religion, ecology, politics), is how Herbert consistently nails the payoffs for the complex topics that shape his world. These themes and forces don't exist in a vacuum, they pull and push the story in powerful and interesting ways.

One of the things that bugs me about hero's journey books is when the hero triumphs in the end, but there are obvious, unresolved issues remaining. Issues that would torpedo a ""happily ever after"" ending.

Not so in Dune. By the time you finish the third book, it's apparent that Herbert has put immense thought into the aftermath of the hero's journey.

Just so we're clear, Frank Herbert, author of *Dune*, did not write any books about the Butlerian Jihad. Those are by his son, Brian Herbert, working with Kevin J. Anderson. They contradict the original books, and are generally not thought to represent Frank Herbert's ideas.

Frank did outline the backstory and history he had in mind for his universe in *Dune* itself and the sequels.

An old friend was Executive Editor at the publisher that held the rights to the book at the time.  She and her staff watched the earnest marketing types talking about film tie-in merchandise with bemusement.

""Dune *coloring*  books?"" ""Yes, with two crayons included.  Brown and black.""

""Dune *action figures?*"" ""Yes, including Baron Harkonnen with a cat in a cage.  Just don't put it on the shelf next to the Paul Atriedes action figure...""

It was clear to them that no one involved in tie-in marketing for the film had actually *read* the book.

I still recall the sequence of (IIRC) Brad Dourif, playing the Baron's Mentat Assassin Piter De Vries, approaching the Baron's HQ in an aircar chanting ""*Love is the law, love under will..*"", and wondered who had been reading Aliester Crowley and what they were on when they wrote that line.

It's hardly the only example.  When a book is optioned for film, and someone decides to *make*  the film, it's out of the author's hands.  The completed film may bear scant resemblance to the book.

Roger Zelazny's *Damnation Alley* got made into a film.  It was awful. But Roger knew going in that was the likely result.  He took the money, and the money from the film paid for his nice house in Colorado with a stunning view of the mountains. He was philosophical about the quality of the film, and never expected better.

Several of Robert A. Heinlein's books be came films, after he was dead and gone.  The Horrible Example is *Starship Troopers.*  The *book* is a coming of age story.  Teenager Johnny Rico grows up and learns to take responsibility against the backdrop of a brewing interstellar (which goes active while he is a recruit in basic trains.)  He learns responsibility for himself as a Trained Private, for his men as a non-commissioned officer, and for the entire human race as a commissioned officer.  His moral growth is charted by his answers at varying points to ""why we fight"".

The film tried to turn it into anti-war and anti-fascist satire (and failed on both counts), and completely missed or ignored the point of the book.  It was also mindbogglingly *stupid,*  like a sequence where an arachnid on the enemy Bugs' planet damages an orbiting Terran warship by *farting* plasma at it.  The bugs were sentient tool users who built and flew starships, but you would never know it from the film.

A film that didn't really match the book but I respected was *Bladerunner,* based on Philip K. Dick's *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*  The film bore only a passing resemblance to the book, but Dick was still alive when it was filming, visited the set, and declared himself happy with what they were doing.

What viewer expectations will be will be in part based on how many read the book.  The vast majority of films based on books will have only a tiny fraction of the audience people who read the book on which it was based.  The rest will have no preexisting notions to deal with.

The Harry Potter films were one notable exception.  The filmmakers tried to stay as close to the books as possible because they assumed the majority of the audience *had* read the books and would want the film to reproduce the book. I saw criticism suggesting the films would have been better as *films* if the producers hadn't felt constrained like that.  I think you can make a case for it.

Another was Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films, because so many of the audience had read the books.  He did his best to remain true to the story.  I know folks unhappy about what he left out.  I was astonished by what he managed to leave in, including verbatim snatches of dialog.

The Dune remake will be another like that.  The sheer number who have read the first book will set a high bar in making a film the audience will like.  Advance buzz sounds promising, but a lot can happen between now and release. Color me cautiously optimistic.",cuivenian,2019-04-17T20:56:52Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,10

It was not what I was expecting (felt a lot more like a political thriller than SciFi) but I did find it enjoyable.. although I think Herbert was trying way to hard to have some unexpected twists and lot of that just ended up silly. The pace really slugged for me in the middle of the book and didn't really pick back up, but I am very glad that I got through it. You can definitely see the influence this book had on Sci-Fi as a whole. I think I would have found it more brilliant if I hadn't see his ideas reflected in so much that has been written after this.

fuo96b_13,fuo96b,"> Post Humanism - the guild, the Bene gesserit and certainly the Kwitzaz Haderach are not really human in the way we understand it. Do they therefore have the same obligations as ""mere humans""? The Gom Jabbar test - ""a human is an animal that learns to control fear"" - they think of normal people as cattle to be bred and manipulated 

I would argue that one of the main themes of the first and second Dune books is that though the Bene Gesserit are even the Kwitzaz Haderach (ignoring Brian Herbert books that posit a ""truer"" Kwitzaz Haderach) have superhuman powers, fundamentally they remain human, and indeed, because they depend on their superhuman powers to understand the world (BG - manipulation of humans through genetics, KH - seeing the future), they ultimately fail to avert catastrophe because they fail to understand basic human nature and unpredictability. Ultimately, though people can be trained up or use advanced technology or chemicals/mysticism to exceed normal human limits, every character who attempts to do so ultimately fails *exactly according to the trait they are supposed to be super-human in*. 

I missed this the first couple times I read the books, but the moment when someone pointed it out to me was the first moment I started to see there was some real literary merit to these books, that they are more than fun but ultimately superficial sci-fi fluff.

My legal mistake was this: In the liner notes I said the music was ""based on the book Dune"". If I had said: ""Inspired by the book Dune"", I would not have had a legal problem.

9uu3hv_14,9uu3hv,"Ok, if you don't mind spoilers, visit r/dune for the full rundown.

Bottom line up front: read Dune, then decide if you want to read more.

Largely, people agree Frank Herbert's original 6 are good, but since he wasn't able to finish the 7th and last in the series, it feels incomplete. The subsequent content from his son, Brian, is...average pulp-sci-fi.

The first book, *Dune*, is a stand-alone novel. Read it. It starts slow but picks up and, as you noted, many people love it. Doesn't mean you will, and there's nothing wrong if you don't. Just make use of the glossary (there is one, it does help).

The next two books, Children and Messiah, in my assessment, are largely setting up God Emperor (book 4). Many people who like Dune don't manage to follow through all the way to God Emperor, which is a mistake as it's nearly as good as Dune.

So, tl;dr read Dune, then, if you liked it, read Messiah, Children, and God Emperor (which ends at a decent stopping place). If you read those and liked them, read Heretics and Chapterhouse, but probably stop there.",Duke_Paul,2018-11-07T15:38:13Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,14

9uu3hv_17,9uu3hv,"This is why I have trouble recommending the Dune Series to anyone. To a greater or lesser degree from *Children* on, every book's front half is a tedious slog though the galaxy's most powerful, wealthiest, most important people not really doing anything but vaguely noodling at each other in voices that don't feel very unique or well-characterized about their pet philosophies and theories of human nature and politics. It starts to feel less like living, breathing characters in a world disagreeing about things and more like the author really wanted to have a rant about what's wrong with \[insert topic here\], and just found a way to bring it up.

Even worse is that as the books go on, more and more of what would be interesting to see happens outside the reader's POV, so we hear about all the things we would want to see second-hand in order to make room for more naughty rich people navel-gazing.

I really don't mean to yuck anyone's yum, so if the later Dune series hits all the right buttons for someone, there's nothing wrong with that.

Dune ""broke out of""/""was a response to"" the generic sword and planet genre of sci-fi that was popular in the mid 20th century.   Swashbuckling space adventures were being printed by the 100's as pulp novels every year by the 1960's.  Frank Herbert helped elevate hard sci-fi into respected literature like Tolkien had for high fantasy.

m4izvl_18,m4izvl,"I got the read from the original post that perhaps what the OP struggled with in Dune is the pacing.

He said Dune was ""devoid of interesting material"" - something I don't agree with - but it's true the cool ideas in Dune are dispersed across a greater number of pages than some other sci fi, for sure. This is certainly something you CANNOT say about PKD (as I guess you know). Every page is just jam-packed with good ideas, nonstop (as I guess you know). And in his books, important things tend to happen one right after another, constantly. There is not a dull moment in a PKD book - whereas Dune certainly has it's lulls and moments of ""calm before the storm"" - PKD books are typically all ""storm"" all the time (and I say this as a good thing).

This pacing is actually more reminiscent of YA - what many readers love about YA is that it reads ""to the point"". You aren't bogged down in bigtime introspection, political musings, or passages thick with dense, esoteric symbolism with unclear direct implications on the plot or characters. It's not to say PKD doesn't have some of this stuff (nor that I dislike that stuff - I actually like it just fine - I like *Dune* a lot) - but believe me when I say PKD *reads* more like Ender's Game than some denser non-YA science fiction due to this difference in pacing.

I've always felt PKD is a great ""gateway"" to Sci Fi for folks acquainted with Sci Fi but only in a YA context because one thing you cannot ever accuse PKD of being is being *boring*, or dragging on longer than it needs to. Of course, if you want to dig deep into PKD, his books are actually very rich in symbolism, metaphors, etc. and... well - there is a lot of depth to the worlds he has made. But the books are enjoyable reads *even if you don't do that*, in large part because it reads so ""fast"" (like Ender's Game/Card's other books).",Vergilkilla,2021-03-15T01:07:28Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,18

Dune (the first book) is all about Paul learning to use politics and religion to manipulate people, while also having to deal with the fact that those things also manipulate him at the same time. It only focuses on whatever is currently impacting his journey. Feyd-Rautha isn't important - he's just a symbol of the corruption Paul has to deal with. The first child isn't important (to the story), so there's no real point in spending a lot of page time on him - sad as that is.

You wanted the book to spend more time on certain characters or world-building elements that interested you. That's fair.

So I think he really wanted to give people a complete view of what the universe was like. I didn't feel that way about dune, but game of thrones felt that way to me. It felt overly repetitive with details that I felt were like a chore to read so that I could get to the details that I was interested in. The important aspects of the book.

People like different things, and in the end, it all boils down to what someone enjoys as an individual. It might just be that Dune isn't your kind of book, or Dune itself didn't really click with you. And I think that's fine. 

Dune definitely focuses a lot on world-building and cultural exploration, since the characters, plot, and motivations are tied heavily to those two aspects of the stories. That might be the reason why it feels like a slow book. I have a friend in real life who won't read any fantasy / sci-fi novel that has a glossary attached to it. He just isn't interested in those aspects of a book, and I think that's fine. Just curious, do you think you'd be interested in a book that had a similar world to Dune but was written more concisely? Maybe where the world-building is more in the background or if it was explored in different ways, like in a companion piece or online sources? I can't think of any off the top of my head, but I'm sure sci-fi novels like that must exist out there, and I think you might like those a bit more than Dune.

I will say, on the subject of the title, I think Dune is a much more effective choice. Dune is much more a symbolic name. Arrakis is too literal. It is the name of the planet, but Arrakis is much more than what it is physically. It's significant in what it represents, what it conveys, and the images it conjures up.

2cidaj_1,2cidaj,"Most Dune books have a little mini-encyclopedia at the back in case you didn't know to look for it.

(1) A mentat is a person trained to act as a probability computer. AI is forbidden by the dominant religion of Dune, Orange Catholicism, thanks to a very destructive historical war with AI called the Butlerian Jihad. Mentats are typically used as advisors, strategists, etc (more controversially as assassins - since assassination is the only legal form of warfare between Houses). They advise based on mentally calculating probabilities, like an AI would. The book frequently describes mentats having stained lips because they drink a particular juice that improves mental calculations.

(2) Everyone is human. The Bene Gesserit talking about proving that Paul is human is talking metaphorically - she's talking about the difference between an ""animal"" and a ""human"" - whether Paul can overcome the pain with higher reasoning or he reacts like an animal and pulls away immediately from pain.

(3) The precise nature (the source) of spice is a *major* plot point (I know you said you didn't mind spoilers, but that's probably the biggest one). It has a *lot* of uses that make it very valuable. It prolongs people's lives for one, which would already make it valuable, but it's also necessary for space travel - the only way ships can navigate without, for instance, accidentally flying into stars, is to have a navigator so jacked up on spice that they become slightly prescient and can see what they're going to hit before they hit it. The blue eyes is a sign of spice addiction. It does not, however, function as a hallucinogen or a narcotic. There is a related drug/poison you'll see later that Reverend Mothers are able to make unpoisonous by controlling their metabolism after ingesting it - that stuff seems to function similarly to ecstasy, but also has uses for Reverend Mothers.

(4) CHOAM is a giant mega-corporation thing. The crucial point is that it's inextricably linked with the feudal system of government. It isn't just a business entity - it's responsible for determining which land the landed nobility are landed on and which resources they have a right to be exploit. It doesn't really ""compete"" with anyone as in a capitalist system, it just divides up the resources controlled by the government between the noble houses.",M0dusPwnens,2014-08-03T17:27:55Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

I do think you need to continue with the rest of the novels Frank Herbert wrote for his whole story. I will also suggest reading the prequels and sequels that his son Brian wrote. They give a greater description of what happened before and after the original six novels. They are written in a someone different (i.e. modern) style, for lack of a better term. I will disagree with one responder though that said if you read Paul in the first book as a hero that turned ""bad"" in Dune Messiah that you read Dune in a superficial manner.

Youre right about this. I felt it was a movie that suddenly rushed into the final act after taking the first two acts to establish the characters in play. It really would have read better if we knew more from the minds of the conspirators. It would have helped suspense. It sort of ended unexpectedtly. 

I also agree with you in a sense about Paul. He spent 80% of Dune trying to keep himself and his mother alive while dealing with prescience that just hit him. 

If you don't bend to people's opinions then you're smart, or as aware as they are. It's hilarious that people are shocked that art responds to people differently.

This was very evident in dune with the undertones. When Paul spoke, even as a child, it sounded like an adult. That charisma was frightening/inspiring to alot of people. I didn't miss that. 

But Paul saves the day at end of Messiah. And then the respects Fremen tradition and gave himself to Shai-hulud making a legend of himself. 

I don't think Frank Herbert is doing anything revolutionary with these works. It's my opinion though. I've seen it all before and he's described it poorly if that's what he was trying to do.

Also Dune is something you can look up secondary resources for and still enjoy imo, like reading a plot summary just so you know what’s going on won’t diminish actually reading it but it’ll help with some of the obscurity that Herbert writes with. He really throws you headfirst into his setting and just expects you to understand all his made up terms, it’s why he included a glossary/appendix in the back.

A prime example of this is when he talks about the Reverend Mother Mohiam using a knife called a `kindjel', with a poisoned tip. I was like ""wtf is a 'kind gel'?"" when I first read that part, but when I looked it up I was surprised to learn it is a real weapon dating back to the 3rd century BC. 

As it turns out there are several other similar sorts of real world references that were almost certainly meant to force the reader to go look up actual historic cultures from western and near eastern history. Once I realized these references, they became integral to my understanding of the world building that set up in the first half of the book. 


A good article about one of the books more significant sources of influence can be found here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)#Middle-Eastern_and_Islamic_influences

For me, exploring the metaphors and the parallels between the dune universe and our own made the first half of the book the most enjoyable part of the story on subsequent rereads. 

Having said that, this kind of reflection on a story is not everyone's ideal. My S.O. found the chapters that focused on political intrigue to be boring, but loved the exploration of the Fremen culture and the struggle for survival in the desert introduced in the ladder half of the book to be very enjoyable.

I can't say that it's really badly written, as some people seem to claim. I found the writing average for a sci-fi/fantasy novel. If you're someone who prioritises 'world-building', it's quite good. I guess it's subjective, but there seems to be this category of novels written by male authors that I can never find particularly engaging, including books by Hemingway, Dickens, Balzac, Kerouac. They seem to share this kind of 'male gaze' despite being really different books, which makes these texts impenetrable to me. It is not something I feel with all books written by men, for example, Stanislaw Lem's sci-fi (the author of 'Solaris'), writers including Thomas Mann, Flaubert, Camus, do not make me feel this way. I come from a theocratic country where women basically do not have any rights and their main value is based on their ability to feel intuitively, reproduce and bear sons, but not to be strategists and logicians, and I found some elements of this kind of worldview in 'Dune', which is probably why I subjectively have some distaste for it. I know that the time that the author was writing in should be taken into account, but even looking at mid-twentieth century books, some books written by men seem to be more strongly macho than others. I just couldn't really stand the tribute to Abrahamic faith in the book, as I am so against the vision of women as holy 'mothers' bearing messiah sons in my values and politics.",__tinyfox,2021-08-14T18:59:11Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,11

I know that a lot of people will say that if you don't like a book to just walk away. And they usually aren't wrong. But 'Dune' is a classic.

Don't feel bad for not liking Dune. it hasn't aged well and I think that newer generations of readers will like it less and less.

j6dib5_2,j6dib5,"Dune's paced very well. Its faster towards the end because all the detailed and seemingly over nuanced details at the start of the book, drop into place and assimilate into the plot threads that underpin the whole mythos. The history and factional in-fighting of the Landsraad, the dynamic between C.H.O.A.M and the Spacer's Guild, all those threads are firmly attached in the first few chapters for a reason. The book is primarily focused on the feud between Houses Harkonnen and Atreides, but its subjective context is layered between subplots of political and religious intrigue, market forces, eugenics, ecology and ethical considerations, all subtly meshed together with a scope and magnitude that beggars belief.  

And your bizarre ""Bene Gesserit, just a female Jedi"" crack, you cannot seriously be saying the B.G are are ripped off from Jedis? And the origin of the Fremen is there, Zensunni fanatics, violently opposed to the Orange Catholic Bible, but that's not even important. 

The whole premise of the Fremen being on Arrakis is to mirror the Imperial Prison Planet, Salus secundi. The Emperor's crack troops, the Sarduakar are all taken from an artificially planted population imprisoned on a harsh, toxic World to produce a tough, obedient super soldier. 

The Fremen are conditioned to the harshest of environments, and their whole culture has adapted to maximise the planet's most valuable resource. Oh, and it just happens to be the only known source of Spice, without which there would be no interplanetary travel. C.H.O.A.M control every planet in the Landsraad, and the Imperial Padishah House of Corrino rules the Landsraad Houses, and even he only has access to whatever Spice can be mined from Arrakis. And the Fremen are the key to everything.

And Herbert's use of Arabic sourced words isn't racist. What if he'd stayed with English? Nah, the English don't prosper in deserts. So yeah, of course he'd use Arab Bedouin tribes to model the Fremen on, because they DO thrive in deserts. If there IS any racism in Dune, its only directed towards the filthy fucking  Bene Tleilax and their creepy ass Facedancers and Gholas.

Dune is one of only a very few books that I can read time after time after time, and I'd say its major stumbling block is that much of the details and minutiae that tie the plots together aren't even a thing on the first read. The second time I read it, was about a year later, and it was almost like I was reading a completely different book. By my third time, I had read a couple of the sequels, and the sheer scope of it was starting to sink in.  

All I'm saying, is that Dune can be a bitch to commit to if you find it doesn't grab you immediately. But its one of those Books that's well worth a second read. The extra effort pays off pretty big time.",Kali_Kopta,2020-10-08T02:16:17Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2
j6dib5_3,j6dib5,"While I greatly enjoyed Dune (currently reading one of the sequels) I do agree with you on some points but not all of them. 

I specifically agree with you on the issue of pacing, I too found the ending a bit rushed, could have been fleshed out quite a bit. (this does not get much better in 'Dune Messiah' which I'm currently reading, there are still some quite big leaps forward in time).

I also noticed the borrowing of 'Arab' terms and aesthetics for the Fremen, I'm not sure chalking it up as racism is correct though; I read it as a (maybe kinda cheap) way of underlining the desert themes, and really evoking the desert imagery in the reader. 

I disagree with you on your points about world building and characters. 
>There is very little context or exposition for what these terms are supposed to mean.

Wouldn't it suck the fun out of exploring a world when every single element that makes that world unique is explained to the last little detail? At least for me the fun in reading Sci-Fi (and Fantasy for that matter) is precisely in discovering these odd elements, trying to understand them through context and the story. 

>Ask yourself this: could you describe Paul's personality without describing him being the chosen one, or just the son of a Duke? 

I think the point (or one of the points) of Pauls character is that he is not a human with a normal psyche (nor are many of the other characters). Paul is a mentat, a human computer, trained from birth to conduct fully logical conclusions from any 'input' (knowledge, experiences) he has. He is literally trained not to factor in his emotions into his actions, thus there's very little opportunity for emotional growth that could manifest in actions. Yet still he has some very strong emotions concerning the future(s) he sees in his visions and struggles greatly (emotionally and logically) with what he's seen and what to do about it.",The_Reto,2020-10-06T21:38:30Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,3

j6dib5_5,j6dib5,"> There is actually little to no world-building within the first book. 

It's for this reason that the first book might have held up for so long in comparison to not just other sci-fi novels, but also its sequels.  The first book really seems to focus on its characters, whereas the sequel (I've only read *Dune Messiah* and started *Children of Dune*) seems to (over-)invest in expanding the universe.

A similar strength is that Herbert doesn't spend a lot of time combing through each little detail.  The reader really has to use their own imagination, and I think that's the appeal.  We aren't spoon-fed minute details, and it therefore has attracted a wide audience.

> almost none of the characters have any character arc at all. 

Character arcs are a compass.  The compass is there to help guide the character(s) through the journey.  Sometimes a compass isn't needed for a journey.  What was Patrick Bateman's arc in *American Psycho*?  What was Ned Stark's arc in *A Game of Thrones*?  Does Indiana Jones have an arc?  Criticizing lack of character arcs is basically complaining that a story didn't follow a strict set of rules.  The better stories are the ones that break those conventional rules.

The reason it's a bad book is because there's a distance to the writing. Everything about the book feels like you're hovering high above everything, like a bird or satellite. When you should really be down there with the characters. The reason for this, I feel, is because the characters aren't fully developed. They are more archetypes than actual living, breathing characters. That's why it's also a rather dull read.

reading your reviews you seem to pretty much miss every point Herbert is making, by a fair margin.

it is a critique of political systems and religion, and it inevitably says they are all flawed and should be rejected. granted the political critique is fairly subtle in the first book, however how you missed the rejection of 'the savior' i've no idea it is very obvious.

I'd suggest reading some of the reviews that have come out on it over the years

critiquing a book should be done by understanding where it comes from - you are yet another 'i did not like it so it must be bad' without having understood what the book was.

What makes Dune more palatable than, say, the gruesome spectacle of a blonde-wigged Emilia Clarke carried aloft by ethnically indeterminate brown slaves in Game of Thrones, is the sincerity of Herbert’s identification with the Fremen. They are the moral centre of the book, not an ignorant mass to be civilised. Paul does not transform them in his image, but participates in their culture and is himself transformed into the prophet Muad’Dib. If Paul is one-part Lawrence of Arabia, leading his men on to Aqaba, he is also the Mahdi. Dune glosses this word as “in the Fremen messianic legend, The One Who Will Lead Us into Paradise”. In Islamic eschatology, the honorific Mahdi has a long and complex history. Various leaders have claimed or been given it. Most Shia identify the Mahdi with the 12th or Hidden Imam, who will imminently reveal himself and redeem the world. To the British, it will always be the name of the warrior prophet who swept through the Sudan in the 1880s, killing General Gordon on the steps of the palace in Khartoum and inspiring a thousand patriotic newspaper etchings. As Paul’s destiny becomes clear to him, he begins to have visions “of fanatic legions following the green and black banner of the Atreides, pillaging and burning across the universe in the name of their prophet Muad’Dib”. If Paul accepts this future, he will be responsible for “the jihad’s bloody swords”, unleashing a nomad war machine that will up-end the corrupt and oppressive rule of the emperor Shaddam IV (good) but will kill untold billions (not so good) in the process. In 2015, the story of a white prophet leading a blue-eyed brown-skinned horde of jihadis against a ruler called Shaddam produces a weird funhouse mirror effect, as if someone has jumbled up recent history and stuck the pieces back together in a different order.

This is, as you can see, a universe of Machiavellian realpolitik, science fiction through the prism of the Cold War. There is little that is cute or cuddly: no furry-footed Hobbits, no teddy-bear-like Ewoks. (In fact, the cutest thing you’ll see in a copy of “Dune” is the author photo: bald, bearded, and smiling, Herbert could pass for one of Tolkien’s dwarves.) Even the hero, young Paul Atreides, stuns his mother with his unsentimental reaction to his father’s death. Instead of grieving, he immediately begins plotting the overthrow of his adversaries. This is terrain that is familiar to readers of George R. R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire.” Herbert’s scheming, backstabbing villain, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, would be perfectly at home among the Lannisters of Westeros.

https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Frank-Herbert/Dune.html

There are two major themes that Herbert explores through the novel: ecology and religion. By utilizing the same setting for both themes he kept an already lengthy novel from becoming a weighty tome. It is not surprising that the author makes Arrakis (the desert planet that serves as the main setting) a living, breathing organism, complete with the simple creatures such as desert mice to the terrifying but awe-inspiring depictions of the great worms. Herbert uses the Fremen, a tribal, Bedouin-style society to illustrate the juxtaposition between humans’ desire to control their environment for their own benefit and the need to preserve the environment that maintains one’s culture. And it is this anachronistic culture of the Fremen which has cultivated its own messiah mythos. There can be little doubt that the author was fully aware of the parallels between the Fremen and the Judeo/Christian/Islamic (particularly Islamic) desert tribes that fashioned the three dominant religions of our world.

But religion is used as a warning, in particular a warning against humans placing too much temporal power into the hands of a charismatic, religious leader. The main character of Paul Atreides, known as Muad’Dib (the desert mouse), fits the mold of the classic hero’s journey of a character who falls from grace, experiences tribulation, and returns to conquer his enemies. The difference here (and this is a facet that only the Sci-Fi channel’s version of Dune managed to capture) is that Paul may not be the messiah figure but simply a man playing a role necessary for his own survival. There is little doubt left in the novel about the metaphysical abilities (more on that in a moment) Paul possesses. What is left ambiguous by Herbert (in a masterful stroke of storytelling) is if Paul really is this god-like figure of prophecy. The angst the character feels over taking on a mantle that leads to incalculable bloodshed and carnage is palpable and one feels for the character even as one roots for him to accomplish his goals which lead to such conflagration.",TheRiddler78,2020-10-06T22:06:45Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,23

They aren't portrayed as ignorant at all. They are portrayed as ridiculously hyper-competent. However, I don't think that you need a population of ignorant savages in order to have a white savior complex. 

1. When Paul was taken in by the fremen, they already had a white savior (Kynes). He is the original white savior who was able to implant the idea that there was a way out of the desert. I guess you could call him a John the Baptist-type character. Without Kynes, it is implied that the fremen would actually still be ignorant savages. Kynes also helped to implant the idea of a coming messiah.
2. The hyper-competency portrayed by the fremen smells like fetishization of their culture. Everything fremen do is portrayed as superior to the city-dwellers. I feel like this is almost as bad as just portraying them as ignorant.

The angst the character feels over taking on a mantle that leads to incalculable bloodshed and carnage is palpable and one feels for the character even as one roots for him to accomplish his goals which lead to such conflagration.

I didn't get this at all. The book makes it very clear through repetitive visions of the future that Paul is destined for jihad. At the end of the story, Paul decides that it is going to happen anyway despite his ""attempts"" to stop the progression. The decisions Paul makes throughout the book don't make sense if he is actually trying to stop an inevitable jihad, however. I did feel for Paul at the end, but his future-seeing abilities were pretty terrible or he was being deliberately guided in one direction.  

>critiquing a book should be done by understanding where it comes from - you are yet another 'i did not like it so it must be bad' without having understood what the book was.

No, I understand where the book is coming from. I just think that the execution is poor and doesn't hold up to modern scrutiny. I don't think the reader comes away with a very clear and nuanced understanding of Bedouin culture, Islam, or wars for scarce resources in the Middle East.

* House Atreides' power lies in loyalty and mutual interests. They weave a careful web of alliances and interests that tries to ensure its in nobody's best interest to destroy them.
* House Harkonnen's power lies in their sheer brutality. They have no mercy, no compassion, they are a house of butchers and traitors that either takes by force or makes the price of going against them unthinkably high.
* The Bene Gesserit exercise their power by making prophecies and then working to make those prophecies come true. They shape destiny by taking an active hand in events.
* The Fremen use their ferocity and survivalist skill to hide in Arakis' murderously inhospital wilds, melting away where they are weak and striking where they are strong.
* The spacer's guild gains its power from their monopoly over space travel.
* Even the planet Dune itself has power in its absolutely lethal climate and tremendous worms. It kills any who don't respect it.

And this obsession with power goes right down to a personal level. Paul Atreides is not a hero. He is an heir who is taught about power by all those around him. His mother teaches him the power of the Voice. His servants teach him about spycraft, treachery and combat skills. The fremen teach him about Dune's secrets and so on.

While all these factions struggle to gain and leverage power as they know it. Paul is learning a much greater diversity of power and gaining the iron will to use it.

You haven't finished the book yet so I won't tell you how it ends. Just know that Dune's slowness results from its focus on power. The acquiring and leveraging of power. Not a high speed action plot.",,2022-11-07T08:05:20Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

yog911_7,yog911,"It's certainly not a sprightly story and there's something almost performative about each of the characters in how they talk and think. Even if a particular chapter is character driven many of the goings on around them are either out of their control or simply happen. This takes agency away from the character to reset the story to some neutral status quo before another character or plot thread continues the story.

This happens even when there's some back and forth between chapters featuring antagonistic characters. The whole plans within plans thing works in a pretty meta sense too and if you're not feeling the story being told and want a more dynamic back and forth conflict where the two sides frequently play off each other Dune isn't really it. Some of the later novels have the same thing going on, where if Herbert wrote with a faster paced style there'd be a really punchy space opera here but that's not what he's focused on. He didn't write a sci-fi adventure novel. You have to trust Dune to get to where it's going.

yog911_11,yog911,"On a dare, I read ""Dune"" in high school as part of an English assignment to read a fantasy novel.  I'm the only one who picked a book that was 412 pages long including a glossary of terminology.  

I loved the book, I didn't get it finished in time for my report but I slowly devoured it and came to regard it as one of the best science fiction books I've ever read.  So well thought out, and the characters so human, vulnerable and relatable.

That was in 1976 I think.  A year later, a little movie came out called ""Star Wars"" and as I was watching it, I realized, ""THIS IS DUNE!!""  In many ways, Star Wars is how I imagined the characters in Dune would act and look. 

So, to be honest, I think that if you discovered Dune way back then, you would understand it to be much more groundbreaking and original than you would picking it up now and reading it, post-Star Wars movies.

For up until then, there had not been a sci fi book or movie where the characters were real, vulnerable human beings that could lose their eyesight or lose a limb in combat.  Dune was groundbreaking, and original.

In a way, Star Wars spoiled that for later generations.  Not that there's anything bad about Star Wars, I did like it, but I still think of Dune as the progenitor of many modern sci fi concepts.",tygerprints,2022-11-07T17:57:40Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,11

It took me a while to get into it, too. But then I shifted my mindset to read Dune like a political thriller first, and sci-fi second. It made it more exciting, imo.

I recommend you try to read it consistently. Don't allow there to be multi-day gaps between reading sessions where you can forget what was introduced before.

Second, Herbert's writing style is a bit... unconventional. He'll just wave his hands at things that I really want described more thoroughly and then describe in detail things I don't care about. At least in the first book, a lot of the things that are in the glossary... don't really matter to the plot. You don't need to know what 'kanly' means, or what the deal is with the Orange Catholic Bible, or really even how CHOAM works. All you really need to know is that House Atreides and House Harkonnen hate each other, atomics very bad, everyone usually has shields in order to make fighting look cool, Arakkis hard, Spice = cash money what what. Understanding all that other stuff in detail does add layers to the story, but IMHO they are not deep layers.

The sandstorms also create funky interference that makes satellite mapping from space pretty much impossible. So most of Arrakis is terra incognita and there's nothing in place to really count the sandworms. The Harkonens, etc. just know there are a lot of them.

They don't really die of old age or have a maximum size. Other sandworms are probably the biggest killer of sandworms as of Dune. Like I said above, they are very territorial so when too many too big sandworms are too close to each other, they defend their expanding turf.

The whole class had us focusing on the environmental issues and scenarios in various sci fi novels.  I think it was cool because I spent a lot more time thinking about the harsh world the novel was set in, rather than the plot.  Made me appreciate the book on a new level.

Stranger in a Strange Land is a tough one.  I really loved the first half and really hated the second, where it basically falls apart into religious (or anti-religious) propaganda.  Some might argue that good sci-fi can transcend genre and simply use a sci-fi setting to address current-day issues, and I would agree.  I just think that I would not have been happy to be forced to read this book for a class.  Then again, you are sure to get some lively discussions from it.

I guess I just think that if you're trying to introduce a new audience to sci-fi, you might end up turning a lot of people off to it if Stranger is one of their first tastes.  Just my two cents.

Anyway - I actually took a SciFi literature class at Penn State and it completely blew me away and the author we read the most of was PKD.

_x000D_
So really, I think you'd be doing them a great service to have them read something like ""A Scanner Darkly"", ""Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch"", or even ""The Man in the High Castle"". Any of those 3 novels will go a long way to expanding their ideas of sci fi. They do well do show that although sci-fi novels almost always contain a newly created world, there are stories where that world is so eerie similiar to our own and yet so slightly perverted that the end result is remarkable._x000D_
_x000D_
I know this is not at all what you are asking for, and for that I'm sort of an ass. But I feel really strongly about this because of the way Philip K Dick completely opened the realm of SciFi for me. Furthermore, I feel that Dune and Stranger, while both are classics in the genre, would probably do more to engrain previously established ideas about sci fi (likely gleaned from the likes of star trek (or its fantasy competitor, star wars)) than they would to open their minds to new ideas of what it means to be ""sci-fi""._x000D_

In the end this program produces a kind of superman (literally and in the nietzschean sense) who is a hero, of sorts, but also a monster that presides over the slaughter of billions.

It could be interesting to look at current and future bio-genetic technology and the ethics surrounding them. Particularly, who will control this technology when it becomes powerful enough to actually create ""better"" human beings?

ajkwh_14,ajkwh,"Dune is a great choice.  The first book especially has enough depth for the most discriminating reader, and enough action and adventure for everybody.

I happened upon Dune in my Junior year of high school while just browsing through the library, and while the deeper theopolitical aspects of the story drifted a little over my head at the time, I connected with some of the other themes.  In the beginning of the book, Paul is dragged around at the whim of the adults who are his authority.  He has no say in his own destiny, pulled from his home to a new place where he doesn't know the customs or the people, and where he feels unsafe.  His parents have kept some things from him.  He is given little choice in anything.  He is seemingly raised up and held down at the same time.  All things that resonate with the teen aged reader.

Later, of course, he finds that even when he has authority and autonomy his responsibilities and external pressures often give him less choice and freedom than he had before.  This is a good insight into adult life for your students.  As we influence the world around us, it also influences us, and none of us are complete masters of our corner of the universe.  Even Muad'Dib cannot simply do as he pleases.  He cannot marry the woman he loves, escape the destiny set out for him, or even live up to the image others have created of him.  He is in many ways confined by his own existence.

Now, having delivered all of the heavy stuff, make sure they see the positives of the story also.  Throughout the story Muad'Dib finds love, confidence, purpose, and respect.  He takes chances and is rewarded for them.  The bad guys pay for their hubris.  The oppressed rise up, etc.

I mean it feels like a book with fantasy and sci-fi elements. There was some notes and I loved them, telling the life cycle of the sand worms, telling about how they managed to grow the plants and all. And telling more about Bene Geserits, it was good fiction but in book, after some point it felt empty. Most of the characters were dead and we were just reading about Paul doing things, there wasn't a thrill to it and all. If they skipped all of it and show us Paul as a strong prophet, it could be more enjoyable. It looks like it's not a sci-fi or fantasy book, it's more about this prophecy and life at dunes. Yeah I can understand why someone loves it but I was kinda disappointed when I read it thinking it's sci-fi. It didn't match my expectations I guess, it's not a bad book or anything.

I thought the characterization on Paul and Jessica and Leto was strongest, I was surprised there were no chapters from Stilgar's perspective however. 

I like all the philosophy about prescience and the forking paths of the future as compared to prophesy and fate. I liked how cleverly the epigraphs and excerpts from Irulan's books reflected this in the mind of the reader.

pjurna_1,pjurna,"> 1) a male messiah figure is the ultimate goal of an all-female organization.

There is a reason why, which is explained briefly quite early on but is expanded upon much later. It's not because of the notion ""males are stronger so male messiah will win the day"". It has to do with the Bene Gesserit's ability to look in the ancestral memories of all the people that lived thousands of years before and not only share their knowledge but also be able to talk to the thousands of previous Bene Gesserit mothers. However women can only read the female memories/personas of the past and don't have access to the male. Paul was essentially genetically engineered over many years of experimentation from the BG to read both sides (normally a male wouldn't be able to read the female side).

It explains it a lot better in the books later on (I think just before the third volume of the book starts).

> 2) Paul is, from the outset, given superhuman levels of perception.

That probably has a bit to do with the fact the Bene Gesserit had been practicing genetic manipulation over thousands of years. Paul is a result of that practice so he's born with the potential to be super calculative and perceive things normal humans don't. The fact that he went to Arrakas is when stuff started happening to him more because the Spice is everywhere and it sort of gives a kick start to those innate powers.

> Paul becomes, seemingly out of the blue, even more powerful and knowledgeable of the world around him, it seems that despite his brief outbursts of rashness (showing his age), nothing bad can happen to him or mistake could be made.

As I've mentioned already the spice jumpstarts his powers and makes them more prominent since its in the food and the air. It gets even stronger when he starts living with the Fremen and having their food as its 99% spice.

I feel the main complaint I hear when people do complain about Dune is that Paul is unrelatable. But he's not meant to be relatable. There are sections where he's concerned that he doesn't have emotions like a real person because he can't mourn for his dad. As the story progresses he becomes more Mentat-like and super calculative and it accelerates so much that at a point he barely behaves like a caring human and more like a human-machine.",WastedWaffles,2021-09-07T21:02:40Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

fr167m_2,fr167m,"Dune is one of the best series of books I have ever read.

I read them all about two years ago for the first time in the span of about 3 weeks when I was off sick from work for an extended period.

It was a whirlwind. A page turner, for me. I’d get up, read, and read, and read, for hours at a time. And then Dune was done, and then the next book. And the next. And the next. Until Frank Herbert had died.

It’s very good but I can understand the complaints some others have with Dune.

The issue with Dune the series is that it slowly turns into a kind of Foundation-like framing. 

Now instead of stories being contained around the lives and natural memories of characters we have grown to care about over the span of Dune, now we are dealing with events on a timescale of hundreds, thousands, of years.

It’s not for everyone. I liked that part of it, because I like the “what if” line of extrapolating down generations. 

In short, I like history, and reading the latter Dunes feels much more like that.

We also can’t ignore that there are some...let’s call them obvious tropes... that can, if you’re not into Dune as a whole, detract from it.

Holy shit. I want the hours of my life back from reading the non Frank books.

I wanted a conclusion to the original story line so I stuck with the ""House"" prequels (which I didn't think were too bad), but Jesus, Mary and Joseph those Butlerian Jihad books were a tough read. I thought the way they resolved the bridge of hrethgir was ... dumb. I want to think of a better word but a pink mist is starting to descend. 

And holy shit. Telegraphing? It would have been more subtle if they'd supplied a great big flashing neon sign saying ""THIS WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR OUR UPCOMING BOOKS"".

wukehs_2,wukehs,"Thank you so much! And honestly I really enjoy the Dune series as it gives me hope that humanity some day could find a purpose other than just acquiring more things.  That's being said I don't think books count lol.

If it's a story you really like, you can get most of the series in paper back for idk like$60 or so of Amazon.  

I just love an interesting story that they decided to keep writing about from just a single source.  Like I liked the star wars universe books but just not always continuity across the books. 

The entire series spans idk seemingly like 20,000 years at least. 
The most movies and such were made about right where your at. I also envisage re-reading a few times to really grasp what's going on. It really hurt my brain in a good way as barely a teenager when i first found the story. 

There are also, im seeing, tons of threads on here discussing the parts to the story. 

I believe in all, besides like Dreamer of Dune being about the original author before he passed, most are written by his son and an coauthor. They basically found tons of notes a many years after Frank Herbert passed which gave them the info to complete the original story. It also gave them original direction which they created prequels even 10,000 years into the past. 

Seriously any questions you have you can always pick my brain about anything in the series of books. 

Or if you ever want to pick the brain of a chef in LA, the purpose of my business is to teach culinary and I love giving out cooking advice.  Just gotta be careful as not sure really how reddit works and not sure if they'd get upset discussing food in a book sub reddit? Think i said that right lol. 

Always here though and even if you want to shoot me an email and ask a culinary question its ironchefluke@gmail.com that's my personal email so not something other than friendly advice on cooking for someone that's wants some free knowledge.

ewho0j_7,ewho0j,"The key to understanding Dune, is to let go of your preconceptions of what Sci-Fi is supposed to be.  Remember that it was written before most of the modern Sci-Fi material and tropes you know of.  

On top of that, the setting is designed to be so far into the distant future, as to be purposefully difficult to recognize (10k years *after* a far distant futuristic cataclysm).  You as a reader are supposed to be without a frame of reference, allowing you a more 'godlike' and detached perspective on what's happening.

Don't think of it as Sci-Fi based on technology. Dune is a look at a future evolution of humans as a species.  Think of it like a study into human nature itself; that being the things about our nature that never change, and the things about it that might evolve beyond.


The book itself is very very hard to get into, the beginning is tough.  Stick with it, things will start to flow more, the further you get into it.   Above all, pay attention to the thoughts and motivations of each major character - protagonist, antagonist, and side characters alike.

ewho0j_13,ewho0j,"Yeah the thing with Dune is that it's a tad... *dry*. 

But on a more sensible note, one of the things that made Dune so atmospheric and helped sell the idea that it took place in a much larger universe was that Frank Herbert deliberately left a lot of the setting unexplained and unexplored. You get the impression that CHOAM and the Landsraad and Ix and the Navigators' Guild and a bunch of other stuff is probably pretty important within the Dune universe, but since its not vitally important to this specific story it just kinda comes up in passing and gets just barely enough explanation to put it in context. 

Also Dune's not really typical of science fiction, because nothing's really ""typical"" of this genre. SF is defined by the settings and gadgets that it uses rather than the kind of stories or characters that get used, so you're gonna have a wildly different experience depending on who you read. People have used SF settings to tell adventures, thrillers, heist stories, romances, noir detective mysteries, cautionary tales about pollution, thoughtful examinations of gender, coming-of-age stories, political allegories, commentaries on the state of scifi, slice of life stories, and excuses to put the word Fuck in the title.",Fistocracy,2020-01-31T13:11:07Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,13

A lot of modern Sci-Fi is much more light in tone, with warmer characters, less dark and oppressive settings, and situations that are more immediately entertaining and rewarding with satisfying plots.

Secondly, because of my first point, I love Dune. I tend to gravitate to dark and dense stories without cheesy fluff. Dune's story telling is very heavy and beautiful and more neutral in tone. I like that, because it's unique. A lot of sci-fi and literature in general has a fast food approach to story telling. Immediate gratification. Dune and similar books require a bit more work on the reader's part.",,2020-01-31T06:11:42Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,26
i97ixn_1,i97ixn,"I can see where your son's coming from (though I certainly didn't experience reading *Dune* as like trying to read sandpaper!).

Spoilers, naturally:

*Dune* is an action epic. It's many other things besides, but much of its story revolves around big action set pieces: Yueh's betrayal and the Harkonnen invasion, Paul fighting for his life when he first encounters the Fremen, the guerrilla attacks against Harkonnen forces, and the assault on Arrakeen. Dune is trying to do a *lot* of things, and so it bounces around between philosophy, action, internal monologue, multi-generational breeding programs, religion, and world building.

*Dune Messiah* has the advantage of being a more focused and more personal story: it's about the consequences of Paul's decisions and how that ultimately tears apart his family. It's more intimate, because in a way it's the story of the most important man in the universe realizing he made a mistake, and that the universe suffers for it. As does his family, and him.

(For what it's worth, that's one of the things that makes *Children of Dune* interesting to me: that it's about Leto II *deliberately taking on* the role that Paul refused, knowing full well its dangers and consequences.)",BrentNewhall,2020-08-13T21:23:59Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

I wish they had been published as one book.

Dune Messiah is such a fantastic subversion of Dune. On it's own, I think Dune is pretty lacking in suspense. Paul is this sensitive and prodigious kid, who pretty much already kicks ass, and then goes on to become the LITERAL RULER OF THE UNIVERSE. Dune Messiah just kicks it in the teeth, and tears it all down.

The book's influence on almost every sci fi (and even some fantasy writers) writer of an entire generation is inestimable.  It virtually created the space opera mega-epic.  Hyperion, The Expanse, the Culture, and works of Stephen Baxter and Alistair Reynolds would probably not exist without Dune.

Herbert's strengths as a writer are world building and big ideas.  His dialogue is often stilted and melodramatic.  His pacing sucks.  ANd his characters are underdeveloped by today's standards.

o189yw_3,o189yw,"I think it depends what you like in a book.
Dune is incredibly unique due to its world building, its remarks on human nature, its discussions about the politics of having more developed nations rely upon a less developed nation’s land, etc. all done with gripping prose.

That said, it is a slog due to needing an appendix in back to understand anything and it has a lot of monologuing that you can either love like I did or hate.

What you can’t deny is that it is a unique experience that you cannot find anywhere else IMHO.

If you are looking for a good plot though, you are right in that Dune’s plot is very much either secondary or tertiary to the other stuff going on.

Personally, I really love Dune, but I generally like books where the philosophy comes first and character arcs come second ala Foundation style.

(Also, the fact that over the past 20 years America has become oil independent also makes the clear oil politics seem archaic and not in the front of our minds. In the 60s and 70s this was much more relevant and had much more sway on the readers’ consciousness.

However, Dune's intellectual complexity is matched by its emotional and moral shallowness. It's not like ASOIAF where you have these characters who are driven by love and childhood trauma and immaturity that they have to slowly and painfully grow out of. Instead you get characters who, for all their intelligence and foresight,  are basically either greedy monsters or noble altruists.

o189yw_17,o189yw,"Thanks for the recommendation. The sequel is definitely on my list.

You say Dune is a stage for great drama, and that it is full of complex and interesting characters. THAT is something that I disagree with readily. I don't need characters internally monologuing to I, the reader, about how existential their crisis is on every page, though perhaps that is what Dune needs; Rather, characters in Dune don't behave in actual human ways. For instance, at the end of the whole story,>! Paul's infant son dies offscreen in a really sloppy and uncaring manner on the authors part, as if he added it at the last minute. Paul shows no grief. His wife shows no grief. His mother shows no grief. The main character not only feels nothing that his only child has died, but he also feels nothing that the Freman people that were with his child were massacred also. The same thing almost happened with Paul's father, whose death Paul expressed no greater grief over(save for the end final line of a few chapters later, where it simply says Paul cried). Paul displays a disdainful attitude toward his mother for giving birth to him more than a disdainful attitude toward the Harkonens over ruining his life.!<

Again, an author isn't holding the readers hand when he writes something potentially dramatic. Herbert doesn't even choose to let readers interpret characters grieving in secret, because they behave as if nothing really important has just occurred.  Frank Herbert decides to dedicate a couple of pages to a chapter to Paul and his mother fishing out a survival pack from a desert dune, but a character >!mourning the loss of a loved one?!< Nah, that's not important.",GlossyBuckthorn,2021-06-17T14:20:06Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,17

Obviously there was some kind of Luddite (anti-technology, specifically anti-AI) movement. Details are unimportant, its ancient history at the point we're at.

The Bene Gesserit are one of the central mysteries, so yeah a lot of that is intentionally left vague...but power, control, influence over events. But there are many such organizations in the Dune universe whose details are left vague and mysterious for effect, especially early on.

Fremen are specifically adapted to Arrakis, and learn the ""Weirding Way"". But very specifically they're BOTH fanatical, warrior cultures, but the Sardaukar had fallen into arrogance and cynicism. Fremen still believed all their bullshit while the Sardaukar were just going through the motions.

as8ot4_3,as8ot4,"First thing first, the original Dune is probably the best of the series. It stands alone, builds a world to a crazy level of detail, etc. None of the sequels worldbuild as much as the first, partly because it carries so much weight. And even when we visit other planets in future books, they never go into as much detail on those planets because other worlds are not as necessary to their stories as Arrakis is to Dune. 

But you can still view the first 3 Dune books as a trilogy. They all follow the same story in reasonably the same timeline. 

God Emperor of Dune is a new beginning with a very clean cut from the first series. You may even be able to read God Emperor without having read the first trilogy. You'd miss some details, but it would probably be doable with the way it is written. It is also very divisive - people love or hate God Emperor of Dune and it is probably a lot of people's #1-2 favorite in the series for those who do like it. I've just never been able to fall in love with Heretics and Chapterhouse the way I did the first four because they feel so incomplete. I've read the Brian Herbert Dune Universe books and I have never convinced myself that Frank Herbert would have done it that way.

So definitely read Children of Dune. Then pick up God Emperor of Dune. Only grab Heretics and Chapterhouse if you are okay with the series being left incomplete. Because IMO you will need to read the Butlerian Jihad and/or House series, AKA Brian Herbert's work, before reading his books  completing Frank Herbert's Dune series in order for the ending to make sense.",see-bees,2019-02-19T20:06:02Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,3
as8ot4_4,as8ot4,"You should definitely read *Children of Dune*. The first three books are more or less a trilogy. So that's the first place were you could stop.

The second place to stop could be after *God Emperor*. It's very philosophical and less actiony. I enjoyed it, but it's hit or miss for many. It's kinda a standalone book. I believe Frank Herbert intended it as bridge between books 1-3 and a second trilogy following after *God Emperor*, but the second trilogy was never finished by himself. 

I read books 5 and 6, but I thought they were the weakest of those written by Frank Herbert. And he never got to finish book 7 himself. I've never read the books written by his son and Kevin J.

as8ot4_7,as8ot4,"Up to *Children of Dune* forms Herbert's initial story, which I expect you'll enjoy if you've enjoyed *Dune Messiah*; the two sequels form a kind of considered rebuttal of all the prophet and prophecy material from *Dune* itself and form a more coherent, and largely complete in itself, trilogy.

Many readers, myself included, enjoy *God Emperor*, which takes a time jump to consider even further ramifications, and this also forms a cap to a storyline. The next two books by Herbert seem to be leading up to something which is unfortunately somewhat curtailed by Herbert's death.

I've never bothered with them, but Herbert Jr's prequels just seem to be a cash-cow industry, filling in gaps most people never cared about, but they have their fans. ",HugoNebula,2019-02-19T10:49:03Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,7

42crc4_8,42crc4,"Ok. So the book doesn't have a gripping first page like ""Name of the Wind"" (Kingkiller Chronicle Book 1 - flawlessly blends fantasy and literature, in my opinion).

Second thing to know is that the book is not fast paced like more modern works. That's just because it is a book written over a generation ago. That affects a lot of things. Sure we don't really relate to the fantasticness of Moby Dick, but it's been copied and studied and talked about so much that we've become immersed in what was unique and amazing about it.

I use the Moby Dick reference to illustrate a point. In Moby Dick

*** SPOILERS!!!! ***


*** NO, SERIOUSLY, SPOILERS! ***


Ok, fine: In Moby Dick there's this huge section on whales. Written in such a way as to seem both scholarly and as something that a sailor would find useful. It's also dreadfully dull. I had to slog through that part. Took me a long, long time. Way past the time when my paper on it was due (I did not, in fact, receive a good grade... oddly enough. Finished the book after college and was saddened at the waste of my time.. anyway.)

Dune has segments that seem this way, too, particularly to people of a newer generation than I. What I will say is that if you want to give it the college try, like I did on Moby Dick, then you need to at least get to the ""Litany"" there's only one of them in the book, as best I can recall, and by that point, you're either hooked or you need to move on because the book is not for you.

Yes, it starts off slow, and it wasn't until I was about 1/3 of the way through that I was totally hooked. It is difficult to hook someone on the first page alone (hence my recommendation of ""Name of the Wind"" as it is the only book that I knew I was hooked to by the end of the first page) so don't fault any book for that.

The book will also slow down after it picks up. That's part of the style and it's also part of plot revelation. There's a lot of stuff going on, much of it important and necessary for the reader to know. However, disseminating that information throughout the book are bits of expository text, some like the ""Manual of the Maud'Dib"" have that slowing effect.

No, it's not a perfect book, but when you finish and you're like ""Woah, I see that this isn't just about sci-fi, but also about [redacted] and Herbert's views on [redacted] and how [redacted] and [redacted] relate on a [redacted] level."" You may feel a sense of intellectual accomplishment.

Or not.

That said, a good discussion of a book will not happen when there is a prohibition spoilers after the first page (or two?). ",victorfabius,2016-01-24T01:56:59Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,8
42crc4_9,42crc4,"I honestly think that the problem with reading ""Dune"" is that it seems to be written as a sonata, not a novel.  There is the slow introduction which introduces the main themes of the story, the quicker introduction of the characters and the situation, the counterpoint or the sub-plots, etc.

The sonata  form is:

 Introduction

Exposition (Usually 2 themes and a unification of theme)

Development

Recapitulation

The Novel's tempo and pacing is much more structured than it seems at first glance.  This is one of the reasons that Dune is so great.  Herbert sets the pace, and the slower passages give you time to absorb and understand the quick passages that you read.  The pace can effect you in a way that draws you into the world, letting you become part of the mythos.

42crc4_18,42crc4,"Dune is one of my favorite sci-fi books of all-time but, like you, it was a tough read at the beginning.

There is an awful lot of set-up to get under your belt -- getting to know all the political dynamics, the power struggle on the Dune planet itself, the ramifications of Spice throughout the empire -- that it takes awhile to pick up steam.

My eyes glazed over a lot of it, and about 1/4 of the way, I decided to restart the book and it was much easier to take it all the way in, since I was now somewhat familiar with the characters. Once you get to a certain part of the book, when Herbert can really focus on the characters,  some major things happen to characters and it really takes off, but, yeah, it'll take a bit of time to get there. It really gets riveting, in an epic SF space-opera kind of way (although much of the action is planet-based, the ramifications are empire-wide).

At the time (I was  around 10-years-old), I just thought I was reading a book maybe too adult for me (although I had no problems with other adult-level books), but since then several of my friends have struggled with the book, so I just think it's a tough book in general to get started. I think I'm the only one that managed to finish the book (and now I've re-read it many times since then).

I felt the same way with Gibson's Neuromancer, as Gibson just hits you with all this lingo and (at the time) very unique cyberpunk setting. I did the same thing -- read for a bit to get my bearing, then restarted the book and it also became of my favorite SF books.

It's not always the case, but often the books that I struggle with at the start, sometimes become my favorite books.

So if you can't read it, don't beat yourself up. I do think it's certainly worth trying. Looking at it with adult eyes now, someone like Gibson is a far more masterful writer than Herbert, so I can see places where Herbert could have tightened up his writing, but for some reason, as a kid, Dune really affected me in a way few other SF books have.

Characters started jumping to weird conclusions that I felt were just convenient, like you could feel the author's hands forcing them in that direction. Very unimmersive.

I think people give it credit because at the time, no one was doing science fiction with psychology and sociology. Like with *Dune*, it's secretly hard sci-fi, just in the social sciences. That, and at the time sci-fi was mostly pulp garbage. Asimov was writing serious stuff. He helped break the ground for the authors after him to get out of pulp.

The thing I like about *Dune* is that the politics *are* the sci-fi setting. The world around it is there to hold up those politics. Few authors delve into the kind of cultural world-building that Herbert does. *Dune* is one of those books that the deeper you look into it, the harder you think about it, the better it is. That said, if it's not for you, meh? Not everybody has to like the same stuff. Maybe looking at it the way I described will give you new insights and help you enjoy it? But no worries.

42crc4_44,42crc4,"While I think that's certainly true very often, I still think *Dune* holds up today.  It's so quintessentially *sci-fi*.  If someone came to me and asked for one single book to be representative of the entire genre, I would pick *Dune*: It's got laser guns, strange planets, alien creatures, space ships, crazy technology...  It's very well written, and even when taking place on a single planet the universe feels much bigger.  I don't think it's going away anytime soon.

I definitely agree that *Foundation* doesn't hold up, though.  A lot of old sci-fi is like that.

zqsmxh_2,zqsmxh,"As for Leto's beliefs: In my interpretation, Leto starts off as a moralist, feeling the need to decry the myth of his father so that the man may live on. As the novel goes on, however, the ethical grounding which brought him to rejecting the God Muad'dib is stirred and eventually destroyed, at which point he not only has no reason to reject that myth, but even has reason to embrace: Being the Son of the God Muad'dib, Leto can turn himself into the titular God Emperor of the next novel.

As for the curse of the Atreides and the hatred towards them - this ties very strongly into the myth of the Muad'dib i mentioned above. At the end of *Messiah*, when Paul walks into the dunes, he transcends his physical form to essentially realise the Myth of the God Muad'dib. In doing so, he is no longer Paul Muad'dib Atreides, he is just the God Muad'dib. Subsequently, the Fremen do not believe in the Atreides: They believe in Muad'dib, the myth, the God, but not in Atreides. When Leto, too, becomes a kwisatz haderach and embraces that mythology, he also embraces the Missionaria Protectiva to use religion as a weapon and a tool, and using the myth of his father to ascend to that same plane of existence in the eyes of the populace.

As a contrast, I recently got through a song of ice and fire and found it was great with how the world's intricacies were presented (in terms of how the universe, its rules, specific vocab etc is introduced) without being complex for the sake of being complex. Now, I'm not going to pretend they are really comparable because its obviously just apples and oranges but its just the most recent epic series I've read so the example I provide.

The actual events aren't really relevant to the story. The prequels lack that sweet Dune aesthetic because they're essentially set in a pre-Dune universe (ie, reliant on thinking machines).

isbeqa_11,isbeqa,"I was like this with Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. Owned the paperback for years and never could get into the book, until I watched the Starz series. Then I revisited the book and went through the first four or so novels in the series and enjoyed them thoroughly, and sent them to my grandmother so we could both have read them and discuss them. They're not great literature but the story is good and great escapism, and having really enjoyed the TV adaptation I had something to picture in my head for the main characters whereas before they were sort of faceless and nondescript for me. 

With that said, I loved Dune when I first read it around age 11 or so, and have revisited it every few years in the two decades since. I suspect that part of my immense love of it is probably how formative its ideas and character archetypes have been for me. 

Additionally I think the ideas behind Herbert's writing such as politics and power and profit and ecology are really what drive his writing, and the characters are not his biggest strength. Remember also it was published in the 1960s where fully fleshed out characters and gritty world building weren't the popular writing style.  

If you give the book multiple tries, even after seeing it on the big screen and knowing the plot beats, and still don't enjoy it, it's probably just not your thing, and that's okay!",jazli,2020-09-14T23:05:16Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,11

The 900 page may contain the first three novels all in one book.

Regarding the length, never be afraid of big books, you read them one page at a time.

Having said that, Dune is a fairly complex book, you will not get the whole picture on the first read through.  You will almost certainly have parts that are confusing to you. Still it is a very good book.

9128so_14,9128so,"except you are basically reducing both to the most basic ""hero plot"" that exists in most other sci fi stories of the time in one way or other.

THe comparision breaks immideatly down in that SW is (in pulp tradition) a black and white ""heros journey"", focused on character development and plot, while in Dune it is a weak backdrop to philosophical debates about power and responsibility. It's not ""good vs evil"" at all. 

And some of these comparisons are just paper thin, and don't pertain to the original SW trilogy in the first place.

The crysknife isn't a ""superstrong weapon"", it is 90% symbolism, as opposed to the light saber.

The saudokar are not the storm troopers. Storm troopers are just regular soldiers, the Saudokar are a separate army, and the point they serve in the story isn't as soldiers as such, but as means to establish the relation ship between the emperor and the houses (and their armies).

Neither of the two invented ""arried desert"" as setting, because that setting is the go to visualisation of resource deprivation.
And with it comes lack of territorial control, which leads to inhabitants hiding during the day and being nomadic (with Dune being outright open about this being an allegory to political constellations in the middle east and africa from the vocabulary alone, while for SW it's merely a means to point out why Luke wants to get of that rock as fast as possible)

In the end, those ""similarities"" exist because of what they BOTH build on with drastically different results and goals. Not because one builds on the other.

I give you that the ""spice smuggling"" is probably a nod, but on the other hand spice smuggling has always been a thing, because they are highly valuable per mass, with Dune actually directly equating POWER in a immideate way to the spice (thus not being spice in the conventional sense at all) while the SW spice is just spice (we presume)",DaHolk,2018-07-23T13:51:27Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,14

The idea is that the Bene Tlailax genetically engineered an animal for the sole purpose of sitting on. Chairdogs understand commands like ""come over here so I can sit on you"" but are otherwise just idle pieces of furniture. I never understood why someone would want a chairdog or exactly what they looked like. Did they look like a dog or a chair? There's not really a good in-between is there? Also, do chairdogs need to be taken for walks when they need to poop? If so, wouldn't it be easier for someone as powerful as a bene gesserit witch to just get a chair upholstered with chairdog fur and have a servant move the chair? Herbert really should have explained the chairdog idea a lot more. They were just briefly mentioned and left me with far more questions than any other concept in the entire series.

1: Yeah, the timeline of the *Dune* universe is pretty unrealistic.  The two best explanations of this millenia long feud is 1 the Benegeserit manipulation of houses and bloodlines, and 2 the lack of faster-than-light communications between planets other than physical messages delivered by hand.  This is one of the thoughts explored by the series - what happens when humanity lets belief (anti-technology, butlerian jihad) overrule scientific advances.  The result is stagnation.  One might argue that the ""Golden Path"" referred to over and over in the series is the way the Atredies house tries to lift humanity from this stagnation and death.

* The ridiculously low-tech feel of it all. The *Dune* soldiers fight with daggers and (relatively useless) laser pistols, and their best weapon is *still* the A-bomb. I mean, the A-bomb was designed in the 1940s using slide rules and blackboards. (Not really, but you get the idea.) I'd have thought that, in 10,000 years, a Mentat could have come up with something better.

* The terraformation of Arrakis. Paul promises the Fremen a green paradise and starts the terraformation process. Then, as an old man, he starts walking around berating the Fremen for adapting to the new Dune and forgetting their desert ways. His son, Leto, waits until the process is complete and then in one move undoes it, making Dune a desert planet once again. So what was Paul's visionary plan for Dune? Was it meant to be green in the end, or not?",user741,2011-01-10T19:22:02Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,3

As for the pacing, it evens out a bit if you consider that the first book is really just the first chapter of a story that continues on for about 6,000 years. The Harkonnens are not really an issue after the 1st book.

And you are right to ignore the advice not to continue reading. The story is much more intricate and deep than is let on in the first book. The Bene Geserit are the real heroes of the Dune universe, and the series is mainly about them. You wouldn't know any of that from the first book.

FTFY

The Atreides and Harkonnens have a blood feud that started in the Butlerian Jihad ten thousand years prior; the Jihad started the Empire, the Spacing Guild, and everything else that is shown in Dune. As the Empire has lasted ten thousand years under a single House (Corrino) so too has the blood feud been kept aflame between the Atreides and Harkonnens.

It is worth noting however that Vladimir's father was less aggressive and even somewhat peaceable toward House Atreides, giving them the cold shoulder instead of the hot poker, if you know what I mean. When children adopt a certain worldview and a certain opinion about the past they can use any excuse they wish to perform certain actions. Vladimir hated his brother Abulurd (due to Abulurd's perceived ""softness"") so to compensate, Vladimir became more hateful and greedy. This is a contributing factor to his embracing of the feud.",,2011-01-10T20:39:25Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,9

I would not want to put you off reading because Dune is amazing but takes some commitment, especially for people who are not so determined/used to the genre. 

I suggest:


>Orson Scott Card - Enders Game

The film comes out at the end of the year I believe so it is a must read before then. Very simple read. But still provokes enough imagination for all readers to enjoy. 

>Douglas Adams - The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy

Another very easy to read book. Adams' wit and humour make this a fantastically enjoyable and easy book to read. Mixes the thought-provoking styles of sci-fi with comedic anecdote in a delightful book. 

>Isaac Asimov - Foundation

Slightly more serious venture into the sci-fi genre. A clever, complex and thrilling read. Masses of interesting ideas and concepts to spend hours dwelling over even when you are not reading the book. Personally one of my favourite books in the genre. Not as easy to read as the other two. This is aimed at an older audience and benefits in numerous ways because of it. 
A stunning read. 



EDIT:

>Aldous Huxley - A Brave New World


>George Orwell - 1984, Animal Farm


>Arthur C. Clarke - Rendezvous with Rama
A simple sci-fi. Short, easy to read. 


These deserve mentions. ^

The key with Dune is realizing that you can opt out at any time.  At some point almost everyone finds themselves a little to deep in the lore and history and you go a little mad.

I tried to think about what I thought Dune does better, but for each of the things I really thought back and Hyperion is epic.

g6gclx_9,g6gclx,"Ok, Hyperion is excellent. But Dune, the series in its entirety, is phenomenal. While with Hyperion, you've got to wrap  your brain around something moving backwards through time, much like Stephen Baxter's Xeelee books, with Dune, he covers so many subjects and weaves them all so thoroughly into the story that you are pretty much forced to learn and understand the emergent behaviors of ecology, psychology, sociology, and scientific advancement's impact on all of the above.

For example: Have you heard about the reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone Park? The biologists decided to use the term ""cascade effect"" when Herbert had already coined the terms of ""n-th order effects/consequences"" on systems analysis thirty to forty years beforehand. If you love chaos theory, complex systems analysis, and the study of emergent behaviors, stick with the Dune series. The first book is the hardest to get through, admittedly. But I'm writing this long ass post because, as an older Dune reader, I'm hoping you'll understand this one thing: It is worth it.

I'll freely admit, it's one of the few books that I can honestly say had an EXTREME impact on my life. And that is probably an understatement. Hyperion is a good story, but it just doesn't compare. the ONLY series that I think holds a candle to it MAY be Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. It was good. But still nowhere near the depth that Herbert's Dune series has. I'll have to post my favorite authors list some time in the near future just to give you an idea. The only other author besides Asimov that comes close to such excellent extrapolation, that I've read, is Stephen Baxter. The only problem with Baxter's work is that the Dark Matter Hypothesis has been well and truly falsified. But that's a story for another thread.

Apologies for the lengthy post, folks. Such is the life of an INTJ. If we pick something apart, it's because we think it's worth our time. It's when we ignore it altogether that we think an idea is trash.

Edit: I'll also freely admit that I've only read the first book of the Hyperion series. I may be somewhat biased. And yes, I've read ALL of the Dune books. The original six, and all the prequels and the sequels that were done after his death when his son found the notes. I can't call myself a fanatic, though, as I don't have many of my books any more.

6frk70_9,6frk70,"Dune sequels?  What do you mean? Dune universe is divided into two fundamental parts:

(1) Frank's original novels          
(2) everything else         

----------

(1) has three distinct constituent stories:

(a) Dune and Dune Messiah. Messiah was meant to be the resolution to Dune. It is narratively not nearly as captivating but provides interesting closure.

(b) Children of Dune and God Emperor of Dune which are a separate story but they are interesting if not nearly as rich in worldbuilding and action sequences.

(c) Heretics of Dune and Dune Chapterhouse lost me. Too convoluted. Too forced. Cashing in. I know hardcore fans enjoy them, I just read them.

------------------

With regards to (2) i.e. ""everything else"" the best installments are below Chapterhouse Dune so there you go.

Dune is a must for any sci-fi fan just to be competent in the genre. Messiah is a useful conclusion. Children and God Emperor build quite significantly on the ideas in the first two books and introduce an interesting concept which is worth exploring (and which Herbert explored himself in another unrelated novel).

6frk70_17,6frk70,"I wouldn't describe it as third person omniscient.  That's like Dickens or like a fairy tale where the narrator is all knowing and separate from the character.  Dune is third person close which is neat trick in which it's narrated in third person, but instead of from on high from inside the mind of the characters.  This is a neat trick because it allows the writer to bring the reader closer to the character and describe the world as the character sees it sometimes, and give us a world  unfiltered when it suits the writer.  Some times it's nice to how Paul Atreides feels or sees something, sometimes you just want to spit out what happening around him as clear as possible.  You've surely read a book  narrated like this, as it’s probably the most common style after first person.

Now where Dune may trip people up is that it's third person close tends to shift perspective.  One sentence is close to Paul, the next it's close to his mother.  I wouldn't call this omniscient cause the POV is always tethered down by someone and never aloud to flow freely through space and time knowing all.  Actually shifting close third person is pretty common in scifi and fantasy if you count the books the mark the shifts with chapter breaks.   Game of Throne and Mars Trilogy are perfect examples of books that do it like that.  Hubert does it fluidly, which is much harder to pull off not just becuase it can be confusing but it also (if done wrong) can make it hard for a reader to invest in the characters if the narrator will just hop to another one at any time.  The plus side is you get to explore both sides of a relationship in real time.   Hubert pulls it off beautifully.  I honestly think it's the best way to write, but it without a doubt the most difficult (on technical level) to pull off competently, thus you don't see it a lot.",Tolve,2017-06-07T20:32:17Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,17

You'll see how the narrator goes back decades before the event of the story stretching though time in a way no character could imagine and offering his own judgement or opinion on events independent on what any of the characters know or think.   The omniscient narrative is the view from above.  You could make a case for Dune, becuase as you said who it's limited by does shift, but It's scope is always limited to what the characters can perceive or understand.  Omniscient Narrators are not.  Some more modern authors, such as John Irving, writing in omniscient will tell you how character will die when they are introduced in the book.  That's omniscient.

He incorporates the Jewish faith into his world, amongst the religions which have become mixed hybrids (Zensunni) and this heavily contrasts the Jewish population of Dune, where they have maintained purity of their values. Mirroring the past of atrocities, the Jewish people conceals their religion to protect themselves, but remain to have strong ties with the Bene Gesserit which has helped preserve their religion in secret.

a2vnhm_2,a2vnhm,"I've never read Dune, and as an Orthodox Jew totally froze in shock when I realized that someone had called a thing in a sci fi book Kwisatz Haderach. It's very funny the circumstances that you mention, because I find myself using Hebrew terms a lot in regular conversation and usually if speaking to someone who isn't Orthodox I would self-censor and not say this sort of thing, but if this guy had done that then this would never have happened :)

It's generally a lot of fun to discover when people put in their research when it comes to Jewish/Biblical allusions. One fun one I like is in Going Postal by Terry Pratchett, where Moist apparently mentions in a pep talk to post office staff that angel is only another word for messenger and Mr Pump says that ""not many people know that."" I was able to feel kind of smug that I did know that :). (In Hebrew, the word ""malach"" means both angel and messenger.)

Feet of Clay and Going Postal also have some really fantastic allusions to the Golem legends which I very much appreciated.

Then again, sometimes it can be annoying. In Life of Pi, the ship is called the Tzimtzum, and given that the writer had already discussed the main character's thesis in Lurianic kabbalah, the fact that the ship is coincidentally called the Tzimtzum, after a key point in Lurianic kabbalah, kind of took me out of the story. (Tzimtzum is the contracting of the ""ein sof,"" or limitless God, in order to create room for mankind in the universe.

> Kwisatz Haderach was a term used primarily by the Bene Gesserit. It was an old Chakobsa term that translated literally as ""Shortening of the Way"". 

...

> It's very likely that the term was borrowed by Frank Herbert from the Kabbala, the compilation of Jewish mysticism the core of which is entitled HaZohar (The Book of Splendor) ascribed to Rabbi Shimon bar-Yohai, ascribed by Jews to have been written in the 1st century C.E. Modern scholars ascribe it to a sephardic Jewish author around the 13th century. The term itself is Hebrew, K'fitzat ha-Derekh, literally, ""The Leap of the Way,"" by means of which an initiate may travel some distance instantaneously, appearing to be in two or more places at once. Also, the title "" Bene Gesserit"", resembles an appellation of the Jewish people, Bene Jeshurun, especially as ""Gesserit"" is pronounced with a soft ""G"". ""Bene Jeshurun"" means, roughly ""Sons of Israel"".

Well I think what he’s really talking about is how we as human beings derive our values.

Think of the Fremen and how they operate. To someone from another world, the fremen may seem like vile uncivilized savages. That they are a people with no morals. But when you see it from an evolutionary perspective, the Fremen evolved in an entirely different environment. Their harsh environment means that the Fremen live a different reality, a different truth. The things they had to do to survive shaped their morality.

This makes me think of the something cannot emerge from nothing. Morality did not emerge from nothing, but rather from our reality or our truth.

This one caught my ear when I heard it because I never could make sense of it (5th listen through) but I'll give it another shot. In Dune the ruling class lie all the time to each other but they are rarely called out on them because there is no proof. So one meaning may be people using these lies as a basis of morality and since they are accepted as fact it's the same as following the truth to them and they are moral. Then someone can change the truth with a bit of 'proof' but that turns out to be a lie too. Was the person who respected the previous 'truth' immoral now because it changed?

However, it doesn't use them in a confrontational manner as 'Dune' does (using charged language like 'jihad' and 'messiah' rubs many people the very wrong way) and in fact re-contextualizes the finer points of philosophy and theology in a way that allows people to re-examine their preconceived notions regarding such concepts. I honestly think it could help your friend's book club get over the emotions they've injected into what ultimately are just symbols.

When people in our world hear the sounds 'Plato' or 'Aristotle' or 'Kant' or 'Christ' or 'Allah' a whole system of pre-configured circuitry lights up and it's essentially like trying to pull a jackpot out of a slot machine that's already spun and came up a loser.

4i8eln_1,4i8eln,"To a few of your points - 

* So the Bene Gesserit have been working for many generations to breed a the Kwisatz Haderach and they're finally close. They think that Jessica's daughter combined with a Harkonnen male will be the final mix. But Jessica has a son with Duke Leto - mainly because she loves him and he wants a son, but also in the hope that the boy will turn out to be this KH. The Bene Gesserit are mad because they had it all planned out, including having complete control of the KW from birth and raising him a certain way. But with Paul, they have no control, he feels no loyalty to them - so this screwed their plans all up.

* The Missionaria Protectiva is a Bene Gesserit secret thing, where they send out women to influence local legends and create a similar prophecy on all kinds of worlds - just in case a Bene Gesserit woman ever finds herself stranded and/or in trouble, she can take advantage of the status this mythology would give her. And this is what allows the Fremen to accept Jessica and Paul - though it goes out of whack when he turns out to really be the Messiah the Fremen have been waiting for, with the understanding of how to use it to his advantage.

* The gom jabbar test is to see how much control the person has over their baser/animal instincts and physical reactions. A true ""human"" to them is someone who has very strong mental control and understanding of how to use reason over instinct.

* I think the Harkonnens are made so corrupt just to contrast with the honor of the Atreides, and to demonstrate just how advanced and powerful this culture is - you can't have that much decadence and corruption without an uprising unless there is a structure that supports it. Also the Baron is very cunning, but not wise - where the Duke is wise but not cunning enough. And then there's Paul who gets to be both to the nth degree and so he ends up the Emperor.

* Paul breaks a lot of unspoken rules in the end. Atomics are not supposed to be used because everyone has them - if you blow up someone with atomics, you will get blown up next so there's no point - they all cancel each other out. But then Paul uses them to make a hole in the shield wall so the worms can get in - since he didn't use them against any people it's a bit of a loophole that he exploits.

* At the beginning of the book, when Paul's training with Gurney, they explain a little about shields - these are person force fields that all the major players wear at all times. The shields repulse any object moving quickly - so bullets are useless against them. And in hand-to-hand combat you have to actually time your hits to be at a certain speed so that you connect. This is part of why Paul has so much trouble in the fight with Jamis - they don't have shields so Paul's timing is off.

Paul's visions of the future, which are vague for him at first, lead to a very terrifying ultimate end which we only get glimpses of until book three (Children of Dune) where they are explained finally much more clearly. He realizes that he has to walk an incredibly fine line to make sure that the most horrifying outcome is not the one he creates. The jihad, even though he knows it will be a terrible thing, is really the lesser evil of all his choices, and leaves open a small window for a hopeful future outcome. You won't get all of this unless you read God Emperor and beyond though. I'm not sure how much of that was worked out when Herbert wrote the first book - I suspect not much. I think the jihad was meant in book 1 to just be a commentary on the power of religion and how it can become an out-of-control wildfire if used like it is here - for manipulation and politics.

The sequels and prequels dealing with the origin of the Butlerian  jihad are amazing.  Read the prequels last though, they explain the abhorrence of machines, the Genesis of the bene gesserit, the fremen, the mentats and much more.  The dune universe is one to be revisited and digested in sections.

4i8eln_3,4i8eln,"I've reread the first dunebook a while ago, currently I'm reading the god emperor(I previously only read till the 2nd or 3rd book, so I reread them to read the whole part of the serie written by frank herbert in the right order). (btw, so far I find the god emperor less enjoyable as the rest of the series, so far the first 2-3 books were the best)

some of your questions are answered later in the series. the anticlimatic end of the first part is indeed a setup for the 2nd book, in the 1st book everything is about paul's struggle to survive, defeat the harkonnen's, and get to rule dune. the 2nd book has a very different feel, it shows how being emperor was not the end of the struggle, but just the beginning, with all kinds of political intrigue around power.

about the bene gesserit's breeding program, I think their failure to control paul shows a weakness in their plan. their whole sisterhood revolves around the 1000's of years spanning plan to create this perfect product, the kwisatch haderach, yet they were so focussed on this longterm goal that they never considered what they would do when they achieved it. they didn't consider that someone with this access to all their ancestral memories(don't know if that was mentioned in the 1st book, but a reverend mother has access to all memories of every female in their lineage, up to the point they conceived, the kwisatch haderach has access to both male and female memories, besides having prescience) would have plans on his own. and paul coming a generation early made it worse, since they were too late realising the kwisatch haderach had arrived, too late to contain him. in the 2nd or 3rd book it's mentioned the bene tleilax also created a kwisatch haderach, but ran into the same issue, they failed to control him(they managed to destroy him though).

the lack of assault rifles is due to shields. in the dune-universe most soldiers wear bodyshields, which prevent any fast-travelling objects to enter, so only handheld weapons struck slow enough to not trigger the shield work well in combat. however, on dune the shield attracts sandworms, so the fremen don't wear shields. there are some references to the fremens sometimes using ' maula-pistols', which I think are somewhat like guns we know. however, those forces that aren't from dune, who the fremen fight against, are used to(and trained in) the regular way of combat: shields and handheld weapons. so despite shield not being used that much on dune, they still don't use a lot of pistols(only lasguns, but those cause an explosion similar to a nuclear bomb when they hit a shield, so it's risky ti use a lasgun when the explosion takes out the shooter too, you never know if one person happens to be wearing a shield)",,2016-05-07T15:27:38Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,3

I would argue that the ratio of philosophical treatise to plot is higher in the Dune books than even in the Battlefield Earth series (and those helped start an entire quack real-world religion, Scientology). 

Start with a simple concept: what if a small segment of the population (the Bene Gesserit) was able to pass on their memories from one generation to the next? Time becomes more meaningless to them. They begin to think in far grander ways than typical humans, and make plans that involve centuries of carefully breeding the perfect individuals. They learn to control every muscle in their bodies, and they realize the sexual power that gives them over men, who are foolish and fall in love. What power would those people have? How would their plans evolve over a millenia? Would they be for the betterment of society, or just to keep their own lineage in control?

If, in your mind, you could see the results of your actions 4000 years hence, how would you act? Would others every be able to understand your actions, and could you even attempt to explain them to mere mortals?

4i8eln_8,4i8eln,"> I'm not sure how much of that was worked out when Herbert wrote the first book - I suspect not much. I think the jihad was meant in book 1 to just be a commentary on the power of religion and how it can become an out-of-control wildfire if used like it is here - for manipulation and politics.

In this first book, the jihad is a distant, seemingly unavoidable threat looming in the future. It represents an invitation for Paul to immerse himself in prescience, and to obsess over finding a future that avoids disasters like this. By the end of the book, Paul decides this is a trap, and that trying to avoid all pitfalls leaves one too dominated by fear to achieve anything.

It's also worth noting that the first two books were planned as a single story, so Herbert at least knew what the consequences of the jihad would be in *Dune Messiah* when writing *Dune*.",Jumbledcode,2016-05-07T18:25:01Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,8

29w1fk_6,29w1fk,"I agree the ending does feel rushed.  If you read between the lines it's more than atomics and the storm.  First is a massive storm but second the natives have their sandworms. 

Beyond that though is they have the water of life (changed water) posed above the makers.  If they drop it they would destroy the entire ecosystem to the point they would no longer have spice, stranding every planet with out the guild.

Now with that said yes the story ends entirely too quickly.  But because you already were at eight hundred pages adding another one hundred or two hundred to seal it up would have been a bit disappointing especially after Paul had completely won.  The other side could do almost nothing at that point.  A hundred pages of a victory lap to me would've been worse than the quick account settlings.

The only thing I wish they went into more was the country fenring ( forgive me if that's the wrong name I'm on a phone).  They just drop he was a failed quizera hadrack (sorry that's definitely wrong) but don't say how he failed, or really define what it is, or even says how he can be both failed and still be alive.

To me I love dune. The end is good but the entire book is fantastic,  and at least the Frank Herbert parts of the series continue the greatness.  Though I will say the third book went on a bit long in a way that made me appreciate the ""brevity"" of the first book.

To me what made it great is instead of inept enemies or enemies that the heroes fully understand dune produces groups and factions that all are proven competent, skilled, dangerous and all feel like any of them could win, even with predictions and well made plans.  

In fact consider in the first fifty pages Baron Harkonnen practically lays out their entire plan for the book.  So few books are daring enough to do that or even do that well enough that you honestly believe they have a solid chance of winning.

If you read both as a whole it makes more sense. It also deliberately skips those massive battles and flashy details.

Also I am amazed that you complain about certain things without seeing how  biased you are because of how film deals with the narrative! Dune isn't a film, even less than a summer blockbuster and who knows if the climactic battle wasn't forced by publisher's expectations. When Dune was published in **1965** there was very little in terms of sci-fi as we know today. There's absolutely nothing in all of the series which resembles this grandiose scale you seem to expect. It's a story about politics, religion and characters involved in grand events. Not about huge space battles.

Besides if you read the ending it's obvious that the nukes tear down the wall to let the storm in. The storm neutralizes the shield through its static electricity  and with the shields out Fremen warriors riding Sandworms do a short work of Sardaukars.  While somewhat cliche it makes perfect sense in the book.

I agree with you, but I actually think that's part of the problem with the series. I wish the first book was slightly more self-contained. Herbert writes so that everything is hidden until the last minute, which can be frustrating at times when the reader feels completely lost or misled and is unsure if there is going to be a payoff for their patience. When people tell me ""just wait until the third book"" I'm immediately suspicious, because I'm being told I have to invest a lot of time before I can even tell if this will be worth my effort or not. I guess I have a fear of reading a bad book or series when I could be reading a good one instead.

i53qgr_1,i53qgr,"Reading your post gave me a serious flashback to when I first discovered *Dune* back in the early days of high school. I had always been a fan of science fiction, devouring classics and contemporary work in a mad rush to be familiar with *everything*. And all the while people were telling me about this book called *Dune*. It was different, they insisted. How? I would ask. They would just nod and say that I would get it when I read it. 

I watched the Lynch movie and was enamored with the visuals and the epic-ness of the Toto soundtrack. Interesting, I thought. The voice-overs were curious as was the cultural cues (Jihad? Mahdi? Bindu? Zen?). I don't know if I understood half of what was going on. This may or may not have been because of my adolescent brain crushing on Sean Young. It may have been because of the incomprehensibleness of the editing. 

I picked up a copy from the local bookstore (before Amazon crushed them into becoming an All-a-Dollar). I remember the feel of the slick black cover in my hands. The feel and smell of the mass-market paper. This was sci-fi as it should be. And then I started reading.

*Dune* is a different sort of sci-fi. It is a book standing on a delicate edge between eras. It has a foot in the wiz-bang adventure stories of the Golden Age pulps of the fifties and early sixties. It also has a foot in the post sixties era of sci-fi that pose more difficult questions about the nature of sci-fi and question its underlying assumptions (Is the Messiah a good thing? How does ecology shape a people as the people seek to shape the ecology?) It is also a book in direct conversation with other classic works such as Asimov's *Foundation* works (in that book the store of human memory and control plan is seen as necessary to saving humanity, in the *Dune* series those things are part of the problem). 

It is an immensely satisfying adventure story with a lot on its mind. I'm happy you have discovered it.",MingotheBarbarian,2020-08-07T05:20:33Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1
i53qgr_2,i53qgr,"I too just finished the first one (an hour past, actually). However, dipping a toe into Messiah ... I suddenly realized that the actual conclusion to Dune itself was lacklustre. Everything sort of came to a head in the final hundred or so pages where Frank Herbert dragged everyone down to Arrakis for the final showdown(?). I enjoy a slow boil and Dune seemed to be going that route. For it to suddenly flash-fire was surprising. Exciting, no doubt, while it lasted, but it left me hollow by the end. Freyd Rautha was built up as the philosophical antithesis to the Atriedies way of life (and therefore Paul, who was himself straying from his father's path), the Emperor as a tragic god-figure pulling strings behind the scenes (portrayed as another counterpoint to Paul), and of course the Benne Gesserits and the Guild as shadows manipulating things behind the scenes for their own purposes (as was hinted heavily in the first half of the book). Then we have Count Fenring who ends up doing nothing for all his foreshadowing.

But the ride comes to an abrupt end ... we see no mental sparring between Freyd Rautha and Paul. None of the growth and teaching that Baron Harkonnen alluded to Freyd gaining before handing off the reins. Their rivalry is ended the moment they meet, with a fistfight. Both Harkonnens: the foil to the Atriedies: gone. All the aforementioned forces topple quickly after in the first recorded battle (the first one Frank Herbert actually wrote for us to experience) on the first planet in a galaxy-spanning empire. The emperor offers little resistance save a petty assassination attempt, betraying the fear that the rest of the characters had for him throughout the first half of the book. The Benne Gesserit Mother goes rabid. The guild capitulates. In the beginning, we had an A-list cast of obstacles. At the end, a bunch of goons. And it's frustrating because Dune started out so strong. I'm no erudite of writing. My favourite arrangement of words is in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, and Dune at places outdid it. 

tl;dr in the last 100 pages, all the villains suddenly came together, lost easily, and the book ended too quickly.

Then I googled a bit and it seems like Messiah (a 100 page addendum even) contains the true ending to the first book, and Children begins a new duet climaxing with God Emperor. It feels messy. I will continue reading though. Maybe this was all part of some master plan, and I will be the fool in the end.",donhoavon,2020-08-07T12:07:23Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2

I actually like Herbert's writing over Jordan/Sanderson.

hsbk0j_1,hsbk0j,I read Dune for the first time this year as well. The setting was absolutely amazing - certainly competes with Star Wars in what makes a top-tier sci-fantasy universe. I liked the plot as well but it felt like most of it was essentially given to you early on in the story through prophecy and foreshadowing so there weren't many surprises which is unfortunate. I also liked a lot of the characters except Paul simply because he seem to be good at everything - I think his hypercompetence wasn't handled the best and devalued his character arc in my mind.,,2020-07-16T18:20:48Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

It happened to most book series in the SF/Fantasy genres back in those days and resulted in some really shitty fifth and sixth novels that should never have been written.  The authors also hated being boxed into these novel series and having to reach for shit just to churn out another book, but they had no choice if they wanted to keep getting published.  

All in all that epoch in the history of writing is a huge mark of shame on the writing industries.  It gave us too many living factories churning out word-widgets on a production schedule, which is NOT what writing is supposed to be.  Then the market for books shrank drastically with the advent of graphical computing and things became so bad that Patrick Kinsella obtained assisted suicide from his physicians because his bestselling novel ""would never be published today.""

I personally feel that Frank Herbert was not a good writer.  He had ambitious ideas, such as the bitter tradeoff that taking boosterspice involved, but he wasn't talented or capable enough to bring those ideas to life.

1.  Did you get the version of the book with the dictionary at the back?  That helps.  They reprinted the first book in hard copy with a dictionary as well as some explanatory materials at the back.  Check your library for it.

2.  SciFi, now SyFy, funded a remake of Dune and another movie called Children of Dune (which actually covers the 2nd and 3rd books).  I saw the movies before I read the book and that prompted me to read it later.  Note, the movie is more than 4 hours long.

3.  You sort of have to get into the style of the book: internal deliberations and plotting - moves within moves are what drive the story.

4.  It seems like Herbert does NOT like to write action sequences.  Action sequences, like the battle scenes are over almost before they begin.  In that way it is almost the exact opposite of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (the book that predated the games).  If you like action sequences, then you might like that book better.

5.  The biggest thing to enjoy about this book is the political and economic intrigue surrounding the spice melange.  The geopolitical environment is really important.  There is an emperor, akin to an English king.  Valuable because he has his own army.  There are major houses and minor houses - sort of like royal titles in England (duke's etc.) and wealthy aristocrats that seek to become royalty.  The major houses have their own alliances.  Finally, there is a shipping cartel with a monopoly on interstellar travel.  

Finally, it comes down to money, control, power, scheming, religion as a tool, and revenge.

Side note: I stopped after book 3 - because then it gets a little weird.  Frank Herbert has stated that he imagined the first three books as one complete story arc.  My girlfriend even read through the books - so we could read the same thing.",anonymous1,2010-01-25T15:10:50Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,4

*Dune* warrants a careful reading indeed, because Herbert's approach to writing lets a lot of work for the reader to connect the dots and interpret. (Which is fitting, as one the main themes of the story is actually about how we tend to accept, or even seek, to rely on someone or something else to do the thinking in our stead.)

He really nails his message on the subsequent books, but even in the first one, which seems to play the ""chosen one"" trope the straightest way compared to what comes after, there's already a number of alarming red flags. (You're far from being the only one to miss them, though.) I mean, starting by the fact that this particular ""chosen one"" isn't so much ""chosen"" as he is the byproduct of a creepy eugenic program, leaning on a Machiavellian manipulation of religious discourses in order to seed ""prophecies"" about the intended outcome. But even on a more directly relatable level, you can see how he's conscious that he's playing with forces that will go far beyond the goal he intends to reach by using them, and will end up blowing in everyone's faces, including his own. How the cult of personnality he established around himself rapidly begins to slip out of his grasp, taking a living of its own. 

No-one is obliged to read or enjoy a book, but if you're ""burned out on 'chosen one' stories"", the *Dune* series *should* be for you, because it's actually a deconstruction of how they work, and how the result can actually be catastrophic.",Algernon_Etrigan,2020-09-15T17:50:41Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,8

I’ve been rereading the original trilogy lately out of curiosity and having some nostalgic fun with it, but it’s basically awful. It’s almost all talk, with the action related and not portrayed, the world-building is incredibly thin, and the plotting is often rather preposterous. But I think it still wins fans — it’s about the ideas or something, even though those are preposterous, too. But i really did like it as a teenager.

I haven’t cracked Dune in 20 years, but I think it’s fared somewhat better even though it already seemed dated then. The “chosen one” story was stale, but I think people like it for the ecology and the aristocratic intrigue. I think Hebert might have intended it less as “chosen one” and more as holy war. The main story elements seem kind of silly and I don’t think the Fremen or the Saudarkar hold up sociologically, but it does have a lot more world-building than Foundation, at least.",pheisenberg,2020-09-14T02:44:05Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,12

For one: danger. Danger is ever present in Dune, and Paul's upbringing and powers do not make him immune to them. His powers are not a reason to legitimately think he's safe from all harm, if anything is then it's that he's the protagonist of book, so he surely won't die halfway through it. This however is just a lack of suspension of disbelief on the readers part, as we can make this point for almost any story.

Secondly, your ""Jesus story"" criticism seems to paint Paul as the one on control, as special and amazing and changing the world to his liking on a whim. Yet upon reading the book I find that Paul is very rarely if ever ""in control"". From his breeding and upbringing, the transfer to Arrakis, and the plots of the Landsraad, to being pulled away from his life to the desert and being forced to play the part of a prophecy he does not want in order to survive, and ultimately leading to the Jihad which he fails to prevent. Nothing seems to go as Paul wants it to, and though he does win a nominal victory, it rings hollow.

There is really only one, maybe two decisions I can attribute to Paul that are his own, the important one taking place in Messiah and being itself a failure to live up to his destiny. And even here, he is ultimately trapped.

I thought it simplified the story enough to make it more accessible (though I guess you could argue that simplifying the story takes away from the material). I went on to read Dune Messiah which was a struggle and gave up one chapter into children of dune. 

I mostly stick to what I like but occasionally will pick up something in another genre as kind of a refresh. Also tastes change as we get older and its nice to not get stuck in a rut.

h7rvvl_1,h7rvvl,"Science fiction used to be regarded as a sub-genre of fantasy, so I'd argue Dune is both fantasy and science fiction.",Atomhed,2020-06-12T20:29:39Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1
h7rvvl_2,h7rvvl,"It really depends on how you want to define the terms - different people are going to come up with different definitions.

However, I'd generally argue that the distinction is about how the work uses setting. In science fiction, it's a critical part of the story. In fantasy, it's normally superfluous.

That is, a fantasy novel could be shorn of all fantastic trappings and you'd have the same story. The novel doesn't deal with questions arising from the setting itself but is merely placed in that setting.

In contrast, science fiction raises questions related to the setting itself.

Consider the movie Inception. This deals with a wholly fantastic world where everything happens as if by magic. Want a rocket launcher? Dream it up. Want to build entire worlds? Have at it.

But it's science fiction rather than fantasy because the story couldn't even exist without those fantastic trappings. There's no way to do a 'real world remake' of Inception.

On the other hand, consider Star Wars. It has starships and space stations, hyperspace and galactic empires. But none of that is really relevant to the story. You could make the same exact story about a boy growing up in Brooklyn with a mysteriously absent father (and mother, I guess - but he doesn't seem too wound up about Mom being gone). Star Wars is fantasy.

The first Dune novel is largely about oil. It's the medium by which civilizations function and the core point of conflict between those civilizations. World War II was, at its core, a fight over oil. While Herbert's vision of ""space oil"" went a bit further - spice also extends life and perception in human beings while being peculiarly absent everywhere except a single planet - it's not unreasonable to classify the first book as 'fantasy'.

I'd argue the subsequent books are much more 'science fiction'. Speculating about the impact of a millennia-long regime of a single omniscient ruler is science fiction. The impact of being able to hide from that omniscience is science fiction. Dealing with what happens with super-intelligence machines is science fiction.

None of these things have any direct analogue in the real world. You can't say ""well, super-intelligent machines are just like training dogs to herd sheep!"" or ""Queen Elizabeth has been ruling for an awfully long time now..."" and get to the story the later Dune books are trying to tell.",ViskerRatio,2020-06-12T20:31:37Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2
h7rvvl_3,h7rvvl,"I’d say it has some strong fantasy elements. 

To me though, the key element of fantasy is manifesting the internal conflicts of the heart externally in the world.

*spoiler alerts for any books I mention.*

For example, the dragons often reflect greed. Interestingly, the dwarves in the hobbit face a dragon kill it, then face their own greed which turns out to be more dangerous, creating a war which kills many of them. 

The Fifth Season (a fantastic sci-fi/fantasy) is set in a world that experiences massive cataclysmic events that reflect the characters own anger and struggles to control her emotions. Nevermind that the giant spaceship crystals, nano-technology, and sentient rock robots. Fantasy can have technology and be in the future.

Song of Ice and Fire has tons of this too with the Others reflecting the hatred of mankind that many harbour. They are a literal manifestation of the children of the forest’s hatred (my speculation based on the show). 

Liches personify the fear of death. Dementors are depression. In Mordor, the evil becomes physical with desert plains and choking gases.

Sci-fi generally uses invented technologies or constructs to explore their impact on people or society. It speculates about the future or possible futures or even possible different realities. 

It doesn’t have to be purely technology. 1984, for example, looks at a highly-perfected propaganda machine more than technology. But the focus is very much about how that propaganda shapes the society and the character navigating around the propaganda-fuelled society.

Since Star Wars is about Luke facing down his own internal conflict to be able control the force, something which reflects a Jedi’s internal heart, it is very much a fantasy in my opinion.

Dune to me, very much keeps the societies and their political conflicts at the core of its exploration. That to me makes it more sci-fi.",4tomicZ,2020-06-12T21:37:40Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,3

Comparing Dune to... say Star Trek. Star Trek has characters that can disappear and reappear, godlike entities that can change time and space, mind readers, and a variety of fantasy races including supernatural entities of 'pure evil'. However, few people would describe it as a fantasy because of the underlying technobabblogical explanations (hand waving of a type) and the overall setting.

I think Dune fits into a similar category in that the overall setting of Dune is interstellar travel and technology. A lot of the story that involves mind reading, knowledge transfer, supernatural-esque weapons, etc is also hand waved with explanations similar to Star Trek. My perspective in the past has been that Dune's fantasy aspects have roots in a far future of technology which coaxes us into generalizing the work as science fiction.",,2020-06-12T22:42:09Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,6

I've heard people gush about its politics and intrigue, but I don't see it. It's plotting and worldbuilding at its most shallow - lots of elements to see, but no depth to any of it.

It's a very rich story on its own, but if you let yourself run with the ideas in the spaces between the lines it can become even richer. One example is trying to puzzle out the etymology of the terms. Another is the flash-forward excerpts of the reference books of the future (borrowed from Asimov?).

I found it interesting that the sequels did not have this same inspirational quality for me. They were much less multi-dimensional.

It does involve world-building, but more in the exploratory sense than the expository sense. You're dropped into this place and you don't have the benefit of many info dumps to get your bearings. I prefer this. It's confusing, but there are more confusing anti-worldbuilding books out there (Gormenghast!).

A book like this would benefit from a massive budget modern movie production so you could really start to inhabit the spaces where the story takes place. The 80s version just doesn't get there.

If you can do this purely through your own vision you will benefit immensely - inhabit the space in your imagination and really explore it.

The Harkonnens are essentially evil, even by the standards of the galaxy's aristocracy. They seem to take an actual delight in the degradation of the spirits of the people they rule, and numerous references are made to how heavy-handed and cruel, purposefully so, their rule of Dune is. The Padishah Emperor is not exactly evil himself, being as much beholden to the system of the galaxy as he rules over it, but he is still hopelessly corrupt by that very fact. The Space Guild is a sort of Lawful Evil--their monopoly over space travel keeps the galaxy under the control of the aristocracy and props up a system that they know is one day destined to fail, to the detriment of civilization, but they do it because they have become addicted to Spice and their own power.

Revenge, more than anything. His family was betrayed and slaughtered by the people to whom they gave loyalty. He wants to pay them back for that, without causing a violent galactic Jihad. The central conflict is that though he knows he can likely do the former, it seems impossible without causing the latter

>They named things in arabic(?) for some reason, not explained, they might be religious but that isn't explained either.

There needs to be none, for people in the books its a normal part of their culture, so they didn't think about it, just like you might not know or think about lots of parts of our culture and their origins, like circumcision which is a leftover of ritualistic marking men get when becoming adult, and it has moved to infants while it's usually practiced at the age of 10-15 when most of those rites of passage happen. Other versions of the same type of markings are just cutting your frenulum, talking out the teeth, tattooing, scarification, etc. Those markings are bestowed after a rite of passage, and Paul goes through one, he can only be considered a man after he rides a worm.

It's done deliberately, lots of parts that are alien to a modern western society, and some are identifiable, like Muslim derived words, and some might be not, like an importance of a status of a man is some societies and how a person becomes one. While creating Dune, Herbert has deliberately pulled from several cultures.

The fact that Empire is a feudal society didn't seem to bother you even though society being that way in the future is very strange. But it's a European past, so people tend to skip past that as ""usual"".

To address your confusion more directly, the point Dune making is, that in future societies blended, instead of the way western sci-fi tended to present it - that everyone adapted western norms and everything else was erased. It's a point of view that was there for a long time in western society, and while it's talked about like it disappeared when nazism have shown extreme forms of it in Europe instead of colonies, that belief still exists and you can notice in a lot of literature when it deals with any kind of ""other"" in different forms"" ""we're better then you, so you don't deserve what you have/to decide for yourself/to exist"", which is also referenced in how people from Houses and Empire view Freemen and how they actually are. It's normal for a lot of cultures, but Herbert was in conversation with what was written in Europe.

>Seemed to me like they overthrew Arrakis just for the sake of it or at least there is no injustice or evil to defeat (which would be told by the omniscent narrator), the main character seemingly motivated by power??

Yes, because it's not a heroic fantasy, or a Disney movie. Lots of people are motivated by a desire for power and a desire to survive, and that's it. If you read sagas or classic novels from the XIX century, lots of nobles have strange motivations we tend to discount and minimize because we live in bourgeoise society which doesn't believe in aristocratic honor or innate right to rule, although we still get some of it - military and gangsters still have it. Paul, while conflicted, doesn't have qualms of modern people - among other things he wants to survive, to rule, to wage vengeance against his father's killers and those destroyed his house. He seems to be better then Harconnen, but his actions still cause a jihad billions of dead, so you can think what you want about it.

>Acually just spice addiction(/s)?? The messiah does a coup on the empire for spice but just why? and what is the relevance of the story to an unexplained situation in what looks like peace?

* The Harkonnen wield terror as a weapon. They use violence, assassination, spycraft, blackmail and betrayal to keep the upper hand.
* The Bene Gesserit are king makers. They prophesies the future and then work to make their own prophecies come true.
* The Space Guild controls travel between worlds.
* The Freemen use guerrilla tactics, stealth and the savage nature of Arakis itself to remain standing amidst the more powerful factions.
* The imperial house nominally has the allegiance of all the lesser houses and plays the houses against one another to make sure none ever become too powerful. Dune starts with house Atreides being set up to be the target of Harkonnen vengeance.

Many people around Paul try to teach him about power. His body guard teaches him martial arts, his mentor teaches him about politics and spy craft, his mother teaches him Bene Gesserit secrets and the freemen teach him the ways of Arakis. Paul is unique in that he uses every form of power available to him to avenge his house and go from there.

So rather than being a space fairy tale or a tale of good vs evil or any of the other scifi stereotypes. Dune is a story about power. In a lot of ways it was the scifi game of thrones long before there was a game of thrones.",TheBluestBerries,2023-07-31T14:43:03Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,3

I was rather taken with its exotic settings, when I discovered it in the '70s, but I found out how badly written it was when I read it to a blind friend. From a stylistic viewpoint, it is awful.

The original book achieved something of a cult following, and was compared to Heinlein's _Stranger in a Strange Land_, possibly more for its length than anything else, when most mass-market sci-fi books ran to less than 200 pages. Because of the book's success, Frank Herbert was encouraged to turn it into a series, but the following books were equally lumbering and pretentious. I eventually tired of them. Now, they have been turned into what appear to be equally tedious films.

15ee6q0_15,15ee6q0,"I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of Dune, but I do think there are several things about the book that have made it stick around and gain fans:

The political tension. It can be fun to try and read between the lines of character's dialogue and see what is being said without really being said. It is complex and a bit difficult to decipher at times, but this sort of conniving, power play while appearing civil on the surface is also found in many popular historical fiction pieces. 

Catastrophic climate change. Especially today, we can see and feel the impacts of what has been done to our planet. Dune offers a warning by taking things to the extreme- having to harvest bodies for water and retain sweat and urine as water sources. 

Dystopian storytelling. Related to the point above, sometimes by taking an event or theme to its limit can help a wider audience understand and see things that are going on in the real world more clearly. The ring of truth in the fiction has made other series like The Hunger Games and The Handmaid's Tale popular too.",BirdCollections,2023-07-31T20:02:38Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,15

15ee6q0_17,15ee6q0,"> The Harkonnens are essentially evil,

Bear in mind the unreliable narrator. The first Dune book was 'written' by Paul's wife Irulan as an exercise of mythmaking about Paul.

So when Irulan writes about Paul's enemies, they're naturally going to come off as evil. Likewise, his father is saintly, the Emperor is a doddering old fool being manipulated by the Bene Gesserit, etc.

Think about how the first book is Paul's ""heroes journey"" - in contrast to the later books which show how he really wasn't all that much of a hero. He was a master manipulator who co-opted a primitive people's religion to carry out his personal vendetta, despite knowing the massive toll in lives it would carry across the galaxy.

> The Fremen came there as exiles, to be slaves.

The Fremen were a persecuted religious minority that fled to Arrakis of their own, mainly because it was a barren wasteland no one else wanted.

While the book technically takes place in the far future, the government structure is Feudal, like in the middle ages. Names and titles are important. The main character is a young man with a high ranking title aiming for a higher position. That's a fantasy trope.

There's also the prophecy of him being a chosen one, which, even if it is a fabricated prophecy by the Bene Gesserits, both Paul and the Fremen believe it.

There are fantastical creatures with the massive sand worms, and objects with fantastical properties such as the spice and the pain box during the gom jabbar test. They play a function in the story, but it's never explained exactly how they work, making it less science and more fantasy.

Like most fantasy stories, the first Dune book is also a story with a clear ""good"" protagonist and ""bad"" antagonists. While the series would later be a deconstruction of these tropes, Paul and his parents are characters with mainly positive attributes, while the Harkonnens are portrayed as monsters.

j8am8s_5,j8am8s,"I re-read parts of Dune a few weeks ago, after re-watching the series directed by John Harrison (2000) to study how certain scenes were adapted from the novel. I previously read the book about 10 years ago and feel a stronger appreciation for Herbert's imaginative skills, perhaps because I've been digesting about one SF book or audiobook each week since last December. His sheer inventiveness stand out among the SF novelists of any era from Mary Shelley's age onward.

As a break from Herbert's relatively dense prose, I pulled Jack Vance's ""Tales of the Dying Earth"" from the shelf for a romp among his picaresque characters and stylistic flair. If Herbert's strength as exemplified in Dune is his intricate world building, Vance's is his musical crafting of language.


  T'sais found her voice.

  ""How is this, witch? You bear my semblance, yet you are not me. Or has the boon of madness come at last to dim my sight of the world?""

  T'sain shook her head. ""I am T'sain. You are my twin, T'sais, my sister. For this I must love you and you must love me.""

  ""Love? I love nothing! I will kill you and so make the world better by one less evil."" She raised her sword again.

""No!"" cried T'sain in anguish. ""Why do you wish to harm me? I have done no wrong!""

  ""You do wrong by existing, and you offend me by coming to mock my own hideous mold.""

  T'sain laughed. ""Hideous? No. I am beautiful, for Turjan says so. Therefore you are beautiful, too.""

  T'sais' face was like marble.

  ""You make sport of me.""

  ""Never. You are indeed very beautiful.""

  T'sais dropped the point of her sword to the ground. For face relaxed into thought.

  ""Beauty! What is beauty? Can it be that I am blind, that a fiend distorts my vision? Tell me, how does one see beauty?""

Likewise, from context, I can get the general gist of most of the terms, and give them time to coalesce into clear meaning from additional context. It's similar to when I'm reading a foreign novel in translation. A translator has to balance cultural context with natural flow of the story.

Hitchhiker’s Guide are some of my favourite novels ever, but obviously a lot has to do with whether you like the humour or not. To me not liking Douglas Adams humour would be as weird as not finding Monty Python funny, but I’m sure there are some out there who feel that way.",Zargabraath,2019-02-08T20:11:39Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,12
aoietg_13,aoietg,"Yeah I think I made a pretty clear statement on that in the original post comment. Sometimes a trailblazing book doesn't hold up because so much that came after copied from it. I recognize that is probably true for Dune. It was written when there was no Star Wars or Battlestar Galactica. Pre Game of Thrones and all that. So I'm sure that plays a part. 

And I like what you say about Ender's Game too. I read it as an adult but my inner nerdy teen who spent hours and hours playing computer games really related to it. Same with Ready Player One. I know it gets a ton of hate. I also know it's not exactly National Book Award material. But I still really enjoyed it. It's an 80s teen sci fi film in book form.

jolbor_2,jolbor,"God Emperor is quite different in tone, but it's my favorite sequel. It's like Dune on steroids. Frank Herbert's most cynical and dark view of what a leader who is never questioned or opposed can become.

It's Frank Herbert turning the embodiment of a myth (Paul as the result of the *missionaria protectiva*) into a literal worm/person/god.

It's Paul gaining powers and knowledge to control one planet and expand his influence, and Leto II as the omniscient ruler of the galaxy

Paul fighting to keep his humanity and ""divinity"" in balance, and Leto II abandoning his humanity and becoming a god.

If you take away the supernatural stuff, what started as a charismatic leader using the faith of the locals to assert his domain over his land and independence from an Empire, ends with another leader establishing a even larger, ruthless, and more despotic new empire based on that faith.",123vash456,2020-11-05T17:53:04Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2

They are written in a different style but that's to be expected too since they are different writers from different eras. Also, a couple of them are a bit long-winded. But overall very enjoyable books and they fill in what happened before and after the original 6. These stories are taken from notes/outlines Frank Herbert had for the ""universe"" that he never got the chance to write due to his untimely death. That's why his son took over writing them.

For example, at the beginning of the first chapter, there's this: 

>A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad’Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad’Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.

1mdme2_1,1mdme2,"It's really not the LOTR of scifi. I think people call it that because they both have very detailed worlds and were both big game changers in their genre.  I just finished the Dune series myself and last year I read LOTR for the first time and I think the two are very different in style and focus. 

Lord of the Rings is more the grand quest with many adventurers, songs, myths, and epic story elements thrown in. It is about the world of middle earth and it focuses a lot on nature and mythology and the like. 

The Dune books are more philosophical, political, religious, and cerebral. They often stay in the minds of their characters and much more detail is put into what is being said and thought than what is being done. The Dune books are much more mechanical than Tolkien's works and I think the Dune series has more to do with ""A Song Of Fire And Ice"" by George Martin than it does ""Lord of the Rings.""

My suggestion is read ""Dune"" and ""Dune Messiah"" together as one book. If you find that you absolutely hate the books then don't bother, but if you like ""Dune"" I then ""Dune Messiah"" should follow it up shortly. The first two really form one complete story together and after that the rest of the books in the Dune series can be read as you like. ",BigBlueWalrus,2013-09-14T15:20:00Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1
1mdme2_2,1mdme2,"As someone who's read both and much preferred the world-building of Dune here's my perspective on it.

I enjoyed Lord of the Rings very much but I'm not a fantasy person.  And the series has been heavily influenced by mythology which in turn influenced all fantasy that came after it.  So you can argue that Tolkien was original when he constructed the work but what came after wasn't and that's the fantasy we're largely familiar with; elves, orcs, dragons, etc.  I'm not a fan of fantasy, concepts of magic, none of it seems real or interesting to me.  In fact I thought I was done with the genre for good until A Song of Ice and Fire which went and ripped up my preconceived notions about the whole thing so there's that.

The world of Dune, on the other hand, remains highly original.  There's really nothing quite like it.  The idea that sold me on the series is the far flung space-faring future that isn't digital or mechanical.  There is no AI, there is no evolution of the computer, these things are outlawed because of humanity's conflict with machines in the past and so humans have only themselves as the instrument of progress.  Just the concept of altered humans bending space with the power of the mind to make interstellar travel possible is incredible.  People who don't read a lot of sci-fi don't seem to have the same appreciation for how inventive his universe is.

This makes Dune the clear winner for me.  You can argue about the flow of the writing and it's accessibility to the reader which are certainly important in deciding what books deserve to be read.  But I'm not literary enough to make those comparisons.  What I can offer is that I read a lot of science fiction.  And I've read enough bad and hackneyed sci-fi to last me a lifetime.  Dune is something new and wonderful and everyone should experience it.",,2013-09-14T16:04:42Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2

There will be no essay or exam at the end. The value I place in these books comes from my response to them. For me they sparked wonder and thought. If they don't resonate with you then no amount of advice will change that. Moreover, spending time reading something that does not work for you will take valuable time away from reading something that does. My advice: try reading, if you don't like the book - stop and move on to something that does resonate with you. The fact that you don't like LOTR and may not like Dune in no way detracts from my love of both these books.

Most editions of Dune contain a glossary explaining the various factions, vocabulary, conventions, etc. Dune moves much faster story-wise than LoTR, and the narrative style isn't really similar. But Dune, like LoTR, creates a huge mythic universe that is very easy to find yourself completely absorbed in. It's not just ""the present, with pew pew lasers and psychic Al-Qaeda,"" it's a whole other world.

This is why, decades after its release, Herbert's son is still co-authoring shitty books based on the huge swath of future history that's only hinted at in the ""real"" Dune books; there's just a massive wealth of universe presented.",pork_snorkel,2013-09-14T15:30:59Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,5

The Dune movies sucked, in my opinion.  The first half of the Lynch version was ok, but not nearly enough energy was put into the second half.

These books will make you think, especially if you're someone whose always struggled with spirituality (the way I have).

Dune and LOTR also differ in pacing, which is something most people did not like about the Fellowship. If it bothered you that it took half the book to leave the Shire, you don't have to worry about that in Dune. The pace is quicker, but there are not too many action scenes if that is what you're looking for. Dune is about strategy and diplomacy among powerful people.

1mdme2_60,1mdme2,"I ABSOLUTELY HATED Lord of the Rings. It's slow pace and extremely detailed descriptions were unbearable for a kid, so I never got to finish it. On the other hand I loved the Dragonlance books, and I've collected every single one of them. At least every single one I've been able to find. They went straight to the action and only stopped to describe things or add some background where it was needed. 

That said, Dune falls somewhere in between. It's not as slow as LOTR, and even thought sometimes is quite descriptive, it's just to keep you informed of important things that actually matter to the story. If some character's relative died ages ago, Frank Herbert just says so, without explaining what was he doing the week before, how smelly and red where the roses in that part of the country and the migratory patterns of some type of bird that he saw minutes before being beheaded. 

But is reflexive, is thrilling and is unique. If you are not a conformist and you like to think for yourself, then Dune is one of the most veiled critics about modern politics, resource wars, globalization and first vs third world differences ever made. 

But with space ships. And psychics. And giant (as in GIANT) worms. 

If you like it and decide to keep reading the saga, do so. But don't be pulled back by the second (or third, I can't remember now) book. Is more profound and focused on religion, thus being harder to digest. But the fourth one is worth the journey. 

God-Emperor of Dune is one of the best Sci-Fi books ever written.

Herbert never comes out and says this and people just assume that ""spice be magic yo'. Spice is a device in the books whereby the limits of cognition are removed and the results of this can be explored.

The theme throughout the the arc of the story is the exploration of the limits  of the human mind. For me, that's what was most inspiring about the whole thing. On top of that the notion of the 'scattering' ensuring the survival of humanity against its inevitable destruction was immensely satisfying to piece together. When you can really grok the characters motives and goals, the story goes from intriguing to epic.

I just wished Frank Herbert hadn't died before resolving the climax that occurs in Chapterhouse: Dune. That his son discarded all the grand themes and made it about political intrigue and backstabbing just let all the air out of the whole thing.  The fact that there are now 13 novels that aren't part of the original series when there was only supposed to be one more tell me that Brian Herbert sold out.


TL;DR. Dune is the most cerebral sci fi book ever written. I hate Brian Herbert for ruining Dune",mpobers,2013-09-14T21:58:53Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,105
1mdme2_106,1mdme2,"Yeah, I just couldn't get into Dune the first time I read it for this reason. There were a lot of things I didn't understand and was afraid I was supposed to understand (what is a Bene Gesserit? What is a Muad'Dib? Why are there these weird chapter interludes by some Princess?).

However, I recently got the audiobook version (I have to take 2 to 4 2-hour car trips a week for reasons now) and it actually helped me to not be able to go back and re-read things immediately to try to understand them - just to keep reading and learn things as Herbert wants me to know them. It's much less boring that way, and I can really sense his craftsmanship of the plot a lot more this way.

I'll have to think about the Duncan bit. Definitely a key part of the plot.
I haven't given this much conscious thought, but I guess my impression he was like the variable in everyone's elaborate plans. But also more than that. Did he represent some sort of hinge between freewill and determined fate? 

A key theme to me was how much power Paul had, but how trapped that made him.

I always treat it as a kind of long epilogue, where we see Paul as a man, struggling to make decisions that would impact the universe. The first book portrays him as a wonder, a god-like hero. In *Messiah* we really examine his flaws, and Herbert does an exceptional job of turning the hero's journey on its head.  
The focus on Hayt/Duncan is very much foreshadowing; he is arguably one of the most important characters later on in the series.  
And not showing the wars is kind of a demonstrative thing as well. Paul himself does not fight in them; he does not wish to cause this but he is aware of the Golden Path he must follow, and ultimately >!makes his son follow!<.  
I would say read *Children* \- it's more action-packed and sort of like *Dune* with a bit more politics and philosophy. If you feel this way about *Messiah* I would advise you to not read the second half of the series.",,2021-04-02T16:27:16Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,6

93e17_4,93e17,"Never heard of most of these; thanks, I'll look into these.

As for my idea of hard scifi, I am not clear on it yet, but can point to things I've liked and would call hard versus fantasy (i.e. character development, stories about good/evil or good/bad), e.g. 2001 the movie had characters that discussed, and didn't yell at each other like most space ship crews; or *Rendezvous with Rama* was a fairly believable and rational response to something alien with nice descriptions of the spaceship and the crews responses, not aliens come to destroy and enslave or kill humanity; *I, Robot* was about the logic of robots and the loopholes involved, the stories were possibilities, not the end in itself; *The Book of Ler* had some mathematical ideas interspersed to drive the plot forward; *Dune* had intricate story lines (as many good books mentioned here do) that also included the evolutionary story-lines of the various peoples, their relationship with their planet and environments, etc.; and *Ringworld* had ... well, Ringworld!  Another movie that would fit this is *Ghost in the Shell*.

I guess hard scifi builds on current scientific understanding, and where there's room to imagine, it builds an event or world.  Yet even that sounds general enough to include more science fiction than I intend.",etoipi,2009-07-22T07:58:15Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,4

3b46ck_5,3b46ck,"This book is literary and a quality meet of literary-commercial fiction. I'm a lit snob and I rank it well critically, plus I personally like it as a favorite.

It's not quite fit for a lit course unless one provides more academic connections. Either via a look at genre and mythology, current events (Middle East, climate change/environmentalism, etc.) or some sociologically related concepts and texts. So I think one has to frame it or do a lit compare/contrast in order to get it quite up to the absolute literature level. But I think this could be compelling material for high school. Uni lit is more of a stretch unless the lit class is focused on scifi/modern myth. There's more literary material out there that won't require one to reach so much, but *Dune* has some unique features that could be heightened via context and connections.

If showcasing the book's merit is what is required for you to succeed in your pitch, I would focus on the socio-political aspects followed by concepts of religion and mythology.

Of course the Baron is an obvious example of homphobic tropes, but the book came out in the 60s when such tropes were not viewed as negatively as they are now. In contrast, GEoD was published nearly two decades after Dune; while it was still dangerous, and sometimes illegal, to be openly queer, it was becoming far more common in the early 80s for people to be publicly part of a queer community. 

With that context in mind, it makes Herbert's sudden turn to homophobic concepts that were kind of dated when he was writing GEoD feel almost vengeful.

Couldn't speak about his son's additions, but to me ""Messiah of Dune"" and ""Children of Dune"" are FAR more central (and better) than ""Dune"" ever was.  
People look upon Paul's rise as the typical ""hero"" story, when it is anything but: The myth he uses to rise (saviour to the Fremen) has been planted by the Bene Gesserit millenia ago, just for this eventuality (a stranded Bene Gesserit needing to take control of the Fremen from the inside). The power struggle has NOTHING to do with justice, and everything with resource control (Paul only gives lip service to the Fremen; he does NOT believe in the whole Shai-Hulud bullcrap, and callously uses them to set up a trade monopoly that Shaddam had tried to prevent by playing the great houses against each other). He betrays his true purpose (to initiate the Golden Path, the only way to end humanity's stagnation to prepare for the coming of the exiled races) out of fear, winning a very temporal victory.  
And when he realises that, realises the religious terror (in every way similar to an IS rule) he unleashed, realises the suffering he initiated, he has no choice but to tear down the machine he himself set in motion, so that his far wiser (but also emotionally much, much colder) child Leto could prevail and do what needed to be done (become a ""God Emperor"" by merging with the sandworm to attain near-indestructability, eternal life, complete prescience and total control over the spice melange).  
To have the first book be the ""hero's journey"" only to tear it down is the central message of the book: There ARE no heroes. Only propaganda, and realpolitik.",ZeNuGerman,2015-05-17T12:17:17Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

I've read a number of the Brian Herbert/Anderson books, but they just aren't on the same level as the Frank books are.  They read like competent fan fiction to me- they fill in the blanks of some areas and stories that the Frank books didn't explore, but they're pretty straight-forward 'this is what happens' books.  One of the things that I love about Frank's books is how layered they are- every character and plot event has 12 different meanings.  That can get annoying after a while- does Duncan never just have coffee with a friend, or sit down to play cards etc. 

>In a forward, Brian Herbert lays out an interesting theory, which is that people hate the sequels because the ""hero"" side of Paul is indelibly tarnished. 

I think that the idea of ""Paul as hero"" was pretty much trashed even by the end of Children of Dune.  Paul didn't have the cojones to do the sandworm transformation that would eventually 'save' the universe, so he avoided paying that price, and let his children do it instead.  Paul can't control the jihad unleashed in Dune Messiah, so he runs away, and lets his sister and kids do it instead.  Frank Herbert did a fairly comprehensive job of 'tarnishing' Paul himself.

36913m_3,36913m,"This is a topic I've received more downvotes and outright open hostility for than any other in the past. I also read and enjoyed all of the books in the Dune universe. Although there are quality and style differences every one adds something to the lore and background. I'm not going to speculate on why the BH/KJA books are so reviled but I agree they get left out of most redditors' praise. 

I especially enjoyed those books that laid out the origins of all of the key players and factions. I can't see how it would matter whether they were penned in crayon on newsprint by a 5 year old; they were Franks original ideas and they explain the ""why"" behind virtually everything.

EDIT: Changed my mind, I am going to propose my theory for why the ""other"" books are so hated. If this touches nerve think before you attack. Also, I doubt any theory applies to everyone, so just because it doesn't apply to you doesn't mean it's invalid and deserves a downvote or personal attack.

I think a lot of the hate comes from fear that any type of approval tarnishes the reputation of the approver.

Example: It's safe to say many readers look down their noses at anything associated with Twilight and Stephanie Meyers. Despite being successful, she's considered by many to be a talentless hack. On this score I agree. I wouldn't be caught dead reading or suggesting to someone else that they read her books. Doing so, I feel, would automatically tarnish my reputation. How could anyone take me seriously after that? 

I would have a hard time defending the writing of the BH/KJA books. If someone wanted to take the stance that they're no better than Twilight I might have a hard time refuting it. *BUT*, and this my point, they are Frank's stories! He intended them to be finished. He might have preferred they not be finished by Stephanie Meyers, but he had no say. If SM *had* in fact finished them I would still feel compelled to read them, despite the differences in quality. They're essentially canon, or as close to it as we can get.

I get that my reputation is sullied, but to worry more about that than the thrill of seeing more of the universe that Frank envisioned misses the point about why I read in the first place.

Dune was a very effective, action packed story.  It was also fairly innovative amd philosophical.  I think just about anyone could read and enjoy it.

The sequels were very preachy and lacked enough action, in my opinion.  That's fine if you like that-- I personally read them to complete the story, and really didn't care about the philosophical stuff.  Just me.  So I recommend Dune and not really the others unless the philosophical stuff or the characters/universe really hook you.  And I try to warn that the sequels just aren't as entertaining.

As for the prequels... they are very plot driven and action packed.  They are not really innovative or complex at all.  In fact, they are entirely derivative and dumbed down in comparison the Dune and the sequels.  Again, that's fine.  I tend to prefer more plot driven books lately, and even if they weren't challenging or particularly good, the prequels were at least more entertaining.

Basically I think Dune is a great sci fi read for just about anyone.  The prequels and sequels are more of a matter of taste.",MiaFeyEsq,2015-05-17T18:30:54Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,9

I agree with people saying that there is a large drop off in the amount of action from the first book to the second book.

I'm not normally a Sci-Fi guy, so the series is out of the ordinary for me. I feel the first book reads a lot like a fantasy series (one of my preferred fiction genres) with a typical 'chosen one' fighting against the odds to defeat a looming enemy with far greater resources.

The second book just seemed dull to me, a lot of pages go by without much exciting happening in my eyes. The philosophical stuff doesn't really interest me - philosophy in general isn't really my thing. The characters in the second book also failed to draw me in, they seemed very bland, especially Paul.",Pippadoc,2015-05-17T20:27:18Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,10

read Dune when i was a kid and then a few of the sequels.  Not

crap.  All i can remember are Sting leering & Kyle McLachlan

36913m_14,36913m,"I think it's incredibly condescending to claim that people don't like them because they don't want to tarnish their reputation. Is it possible everyone has different tastes? 

The reason I don't like Brian Herbert's sequels is because in my opinion they ruined the thematic point of Dune. One of the major themes of Dune is that it's dangerous to exalt charismatic leaders, especially with fanatical followers such as the fremen. By the time Dune Messiah rolls around, is Paul even the hero? He destroys his own empire after slaughtering billions of innocents. Brian Herbert ends the series by turning Duncan Idaho into a superhero that singlehandedly saves the day. I also just dislike his style compared to Dune. 

Another reason I hate Brian's prequels and sequels is that I can't help but feel that they are a cash grab. Frank wrote six and Bran's written twelve. Brian is a good enough author that he could write his own series, why not try? The events and ideas in his prequels could easily have been altered into a cool new sci-fi story of his own, but he keeps cranking out Dune stuff.

Finally, I don't believe Brian and Kevin Anderson are being 100% honest about Frank's notes. In response to fans criticizing the way the series ended, they posted a picture of a box that was labeled  Dune notes. Why not post or sell a page or two or all of these notes to prove that's what Frank wanted? The way they run their official forum in general disgusts me. 

I don't think anyone is a bad person or stupid for liking them though. We all want more Dune and for many Brian delivers, but I don't dislike them to save my reputation on an anonymous website. ",OneMoreDuncanIdaho,2015-05-17T17:48:53Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,14
36913m_15,36913m,"Thank you for this. I have been an avid fan of Dune since I read the first book as a teenager, and each successive journey through the series has changed dramatically as I get older and my perspective of the ""meat"" of the story changes. From ""Hero's Journey"" to ""Manipulative Government"" to ""Religious Fanaticism"" to ""Survival Ecology as Social Psychology"", my appreciation for Frank Herbert's depth and breadth of material has been growing for years.  
  
I read a few of the Brian/KJA books, really enjoyed The Butlerian Jihad as a sort of primer on the origins of Frank's key players (Mentats, BG, CHOAM, etc.), but I felt those that I read really did fall flat in terms of depth of character, intricacy of dialogue, and the delicate intertwinings of powers in play.  
  
I just finished reading Chapterhouse last night, and had that same sense of the ending being rushed, the cliffhanger too abrupt, and the allusions to the ""people in the web"" to be so open-ended that I wasn't content with leaving it there. So my question is, which of the BH/KJA books was written to be ""The 7th Dune""?

36913m_17,36913m,"I'll only speak to the Frank Herbert ones because I consider the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson ones to be badly written fan-fiction.

Read Dune. You can stop here and be okay, but the story is much richer if you continue. You will recognize the story from the movie, but the world is much more fleshed out. The power of the Kwisatz Haderach is much more consistent and explained better.

Read Dune Messiah and the Children of Dune. If you finish the first you really should finish the next. Together with Dune, these three form a nice trilogy. As Dune was the story of Paul and his rise, so these follow his life and his family life as he attempts to actually rule. Paul has to deal with the consequences of unleashing his Fremen jihad on the known universe and the consequences/responsibilities of prescience.

God Emperor of Dune jumps thousands of years (~3 - 4000) into the future and examines what happens because of the choices made at the end of Children of Dune. The power of prescience has forced choices of terrible consequence upon the Emperor. Can a human who has lived for thousands of years still be truly human?

Still want more Dune, read Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune. These are the start of a new trilogy ~10,000 years after the end of God Emperor of Dune. They explore the new power structure of the old known universe, and you see some of the people who have returned from outside the known universe. The end is one of the biggest cliffhangers in science fiction.

Brian/Kevin claim that they used Frank's notes to write two more books, Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune. I call bullshit. They may have had a very rough outline, but they made it fit with their crappy prequels. 

But if you do want to read their ending, you need to read The Buterlian Jihad and its sequels to understand the Sandworms of Dune ending. Otherwise it will make no sense. I think you can skip the House books, which attempt to flesh out the world of the Empire just before Dune starts.",dsmith422,2015-05-17T23:46:25Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,17

No, it's tough to read. Herbert writes technically and doesn't overly explain what he's writing about. So you'll start a chapter where he talks about some gizmo or political entity and have no idea what he's talking about, but then he uses that chapter to get you to understand what it is. It creates a situation where every chapter has a high ""start-up"" cost, so it can be hard to really find flow in the narrative. Struggle > payoff > repeat.

gbj420_4,gbj420,"Dune is not considered an easy read. Even inside its own genre it is considered a difficult classic because it is quite different from usual. 


I would suggest that reading isn’t about winning. A difficult book is great if you’re getting something out of it, otherwise it’s just a point to rack up that no one will care about. Even you won’t in a few years. Reading is about fulfillment. How does a book fulfill you? Does it bring you joy? Entertainment? Knowledge? Philosophical depth? Perspective? It can be anything, as long as it is from the individual book rather than treating the book as just a stepping stone toward some abstract accomplishment of books - reading. 


If a book isn’t fulfilling you in some way, it’s much better to let it go. It’s not just better in the moment for you, you’ll also end up reading more books because the ones you don’t like will both slow you down and discourage you from starting up again. 


I found Dune a fascinating book. I also feel like I could find most of what it had elsewhere, just arranged differently. For the weird psychic parts, try Phillip K. Dick’s writing. For the living non-human consciousness you could try Stanislaw Lem’s Solaris, now there’s a book to win on (yowch). For humanity evolving try Arthur C. Clark. Particularly the book Childhood’s End. For great houses and sword fighting in space about half the sub genre of space opera will do. For the painfully deep world building, try Anathem by a good author whose name I am blanking on.

If you're having difficulty keeping up with the philosophical concepts or terminology, I believe there is a glossary and some appendices at the end.

Herbert's style was to throw the reader into the deep end, and let everything be explained by context as the book goes on. It mostly works, but it can be distracting at first.

It seemed to me that the author had the characters sometimes act as proxies for the reader, asking themselves things like ""there's that word again, what does it mean""? Which let me know that I was ok being in the dark, it would all be revealed later. They were also used as proxies to notice things about something another character said, like a deeper or double meaning, and basically plant a flag there. This helped me to slow down and re-read certain sections to try to notice the same thing the character did. 

Overall I liked the book, but the prose felt a little removed, like I was never really IN the world as I went along. Parts of it were draggy, and other parts were rushed.

I did recently buy a copy to try again, but I’m kind of wondering if I should “force” it, or just enjoy the movie for what it is when it comes out (Villeneuve is a *fanastic* filmmaker).",ArtlessCalamity,2020-05-01T21:36:49Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,25

gbj420_27,gbj420,"I can't think of anything terribly new for a partial Dune alternative. Truthfully, I've been a bit less in love with Sci-Fi as a whole for a bit. Just haven't hit anything that scratches whatever itch I have for it while other (sub)genres are working better for me. The one I can kind of think of would be the trilogy that everybody is recommending to everybody: The Broken Earth Trilogy. Broken Earth has that same depth of history, even more of the fantasy folded into sci-fi feel - I'm not even sure it is 100% clear that it is sci-fi until the third book, it's got that uncomfortable relationship between elders and the young, and - while very different - that same fundamental commodification of the life-force against the idea that freedom makes you more natural and more powerful. But it is still so much more a modern story that I think it is hard to see it as an equivalent.

Part of the issue is how much a product of its times Dune was. While no other book is exactly quite like it, a lot of the themes and ideas in play were very much part of the zeitgeist then and you can see them all over the books of the time. That's just not where we are at today, so the equivalents are rarer and harder to find. So, since I read less of it, I don't really know them. And there's often problems with time displacement. George Lucas has stated multiple times that Dune was a heavy influence for Star Wars after all... and I just can't see it, really.",Empty_Manuscript,2020-05-01T18:30:03Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,27

89wkin_2,89wkin,"Try to think of Dune characters in ""clusters"".

There are two types of clusters in Dune:  family clusters and faction clusters.

So, you've got the three primary families:

 - House Atreides:  Paul, his mother Jessica, his late father Leto, and you can lump in his family's four major servants:  Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck, Dr. Yueh, and Thufir Hawat (and you only need to remember Gurney Halleck past the early part of the book).

- House Harkonnen:  Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Feyd-Rautha Rabban, Glossu 'Beast' Rabban, and the Baron's toady mentat assistant Piter De Vries.  Also, Piter dies but they make a gholla (clone) of him so he keeps being a part of the story.

- House Corrino:  Emperor Shaddam IV, his daughter Princess Irulan, and Count Hasimir Fenring.

Then there are the faction clusters:

- Bene Gesserit:  There's really only ONE important Bene Gesserit to remember in the first book -- Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.  She is the head of the Bene Gesserit, the Emperor's head truthsayer, and she is the former mentor of Jessica (Paul's mother).

- Spacing Guild:  Luckily, in the first book, there are no major characters you need to keep track of in the Spacing Guild.

- Fremen:  There are lots of named characters, but you only need to really keep track of three or four of them.  Chani (Paul's lover), Stilgar (Paul's most trusted siech Naib aka tribal chief), Otheym (devoted follower of Paul and trusted warrior), and Liet-Kynes (Chani's father and the Emperor's planetologist, though he dies early in the book).

The more books you read in the series, the more factions and characters you have to learn about (as well as their relations to one another).  But for the first novel, these are all the major characters.  Everyone else, you don't HAVE to remember who they are and what they've done before, etc, etc.  You just need to understand which cluster they are in and you can mostly understand their motives and such.",DarthVeX,2018-04-05T05:46:23Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2

In fact, the thing i love about Dune (and I find almost unique about it tbh) is that the pacing is so good that I don't feel like I'm reading a super long book when I'm in the thick of it. The pacing is excellent, the focus of each scene is really immersive. It's just a well written book. And there's a lot of names, but I got to know the characters more by the actions they were important for than by what they were called.

So my advice is don't worry about it too much. Don't expect to get everything the first time through; if you like it, read it again in a few months.

It wasn't until I re-read it a year or so ago that I got a real impression that it was a sort of direct response to Joseph Campbell's hero's journey structure. Paul follows a very clean sort of path on the hero's journey and he's not coming out of it in a way that we  should be idolizing. There's a direct parallel with the talk of the Bene Gesserit seeding myths onto different worlds so that they can be exploited when need be. The narrative structure's familiarity speaks to a sort of prescience, we've seen the story structure before. 

Paul's journey is one that's supposed to create a hero, but instead leads him on a path to causing a blood drenched catastrophe. He talks about trying to avoid the destiny he sees for himself of leading a galactic jihad, but it would be trivial to do so if he wanted. Just stop trying to get revenge, and seeking to regain his birthright as a duke. At any time he could have just lived a relatively peaceful life as a fremen with his wife and child. But that option takes him off the path of the ""hero.""

The expanded Dune universe, written by his son and Kevin Anderson are good only for details on some of the factors not previously explained in the first six.

33m4cr_1,33m4cr,"They are and they aren't.

They aren't because ultimately the series will never be finished, and you're left at a brutal cliffhanger that will never be explored. By the end of Chapterhouse, the series goes almost full circle with what you learn about the last Tleilaxu Master, Duncan's current position, and the mystery surrounding the aging couple in his visions. You read so much and take in metric shit tons of information on all these characters and wind up trapped on the precipice of a coming storm that will never hit and never be resolved. 

But...

It is worth reading if you're invested in some of these characters enough to continue. I couldn't stop myself. Most people you'll ask will tell you to stop at book three, some even say read the first book and call it good. I can see why they'd say that, ultimately. But there's the possibility that you're so sucked into that universe that stopping is just not an option. Where the story goes I found to be very cool. I liked Darwi Odrade and Miles Teg. I thought the Honored Matres coming out of the Scattering was really cool. The goings on on Chapterhouse were cool. It was all building to this wild climax not only between the Old Empire and the HM, but also between them and something else. 

Kralizec was one book away. The Typhoon Struggle and the fulfillment of the Golden Path.

So yes, in the end, I would say read them all. Dune, Messiah, and Children are most often referred to as the best ones. I second that, with Messiah being my favorite. But if you're gonna get into a series as deep, thought provoking, and just lined in every sentence with information and subtle pacing...do yourself a favor and read them all.",Captain_Enizzle,2015-04-23T17:22:28Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

33m4cr_3,33m4cr,"Dune, book 1, is all about Paul. If Paul is your main attraction, then you may not want to continue. Paul changes in book two and then he pretty much disappears and other characters carry the story. As a coming of age/rise to power story, it ends well and you can stop there.

If the world itself, the ideas/philosophy interest you, by all means continue reading.

It gets weird, it gets hard to follow unless you pay close attention and take the time to really think about what Herbert is playing with. There are massive time jumps so that you lose all the main characters or they change in personality. Herbert has this massive theory about humanity/the future and you have to keep reading to the end to see how it all plays out.

If you want to know the entire story (supposedly) you'll need to finish the original series, then by the son you should read the Butlerian Jihad trilogy and then the final two books. Be prepared the son's books are radically different in style/pacing/depth, are much more action focused, fast-paced - not terrible on their own, but quite a jolt from the originals.

The struggle with the Dune series, is that the world that Herbert built was a fascinating idea, and I absolutely love the whole Neo-Zoroastrian ancient civilisation with heavy flavours of 19th century European pomp and ceremony, but the longer it goes on, the more hollow and campy the whole aesthetic becomes. At least in the first book, Arrakis is essentially one big metaphor for an African colony filled with vital resources and a population of natives who have long since been radicalised by the early missionaries of the first imperial conquerors. 

To carry on from there, which was by all means a fully realised and concluded tale, just begins to unravel how absurd the Dune universe is.

Things like the Missionaria and their rumination a on what makes a man a man, and not an animal. The situation Paul finds himself in, choosing what path he takes and why. How heavy the head is that wears the crown, and the sacrifices made to help humanity survive the coming onslaught. 

I would say that the most ""boring"" (I use that term very loosely) book in the series is 4, God Emperor of Dune. Much of it is a discussion and explanation of what motivates the characters to do what must be done.

While I agree with your take on much of it, I disagree with your end conclusion that it jumps into absurdity.

It's an absurd tale to begin with, because it's science fiction. You're ok with a bunch of spacefaring catholic Muslims riding sandworms, but the minute you bring clones into it you check out? If you didn't like the following books, that's totally ok, but I disagree with you stridently about any sort of historical analogue when discussing this series as it breaks down in later books. It's sci-if, it's supposed to go forward, not backward.

I would also disagree with watching the movie or reading any Wikipedia article on the series as 1, the movie does zero justice to the book and 2, it's a Wikipedia article. Go in blind and ride the worm, my friend. There's wormsign the likes of which even god has never seen.

The one thing people need to keep in mind about this series is that it spans THOUSANDS of years. Your take on the religion of the series should be respected as it lasts the whole series rather than the three books. A testament in that universe of how powerful organized religion is, and the direction it takes mankind even throughout the changes imposed upon the known universe by the Tyrant Leto Atredies. 

Furthermore, when discussing ""camp and hollowness"" do keep in mind that the first three books take place in/are entirely based around the planet Arrakis. The rest of the universe including different societies, religions, sciences, travel, etc are not covered in any real extent. When the series went forward, it had to delve into the machinations of other ways of thinking, other methods as opposed to the singular spice addiction and control of Dune. Hence the Tleilaxu, the Bene Gesserit, the Jihad. 

I believe that yes, while it does have it's flaws, though far less than you espouse, it continues to be a fully realized work up to and including the final chapter. It is a paragon of the sci-if genre and rightly so. I do feel sorry that it didn't have the same effect on you as it did me.

I want to feel the wind, the clammy sucking sensation of the survival suits against the skin, the wonderfully coloured silks and cottons of the galactic nobles draped about them in exotic fashions. I found that the appearance of the people of that world reminded me of the prologue to the second volume of The League of Extra-ordinary Gentlemen (the comics, not that atrocity of a film) which introduces the Martians in their tripods and the other inhabitants of the Red Planet taken out of the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs. 

It struck me at that point, alongside the understanding of the spice's properties as I read further into the book, that Dune isn't genuine science fiction. Under broad definitions, it certainly counts. However at further inspection, the whole premise of science fiction is to take the wonderfully incomprehensible and give it a rational explanation. The works of Arthur Clarke and Asimov stand out in these regards as between them being the fathers of modern science fiction, as opposed to H.G. Wells and Jules Verne as the grandfathers. Clarke spent much of his literary career findings entertaining and plausible explanations for the fanciful phenomenon that occurs in his work. Herbert by comparison spends much time lavishly portraying this illustrious world, but resorting to blind faith and spiritualism to dispel the scepticism of the core mechanics behind much of anything. Dune isn't strictly science fiction, but *future fantasy*. 

Now what I am saying here isn't meant to be taken as a criticism, but it is supposed to isolate the fact that in Dune, nothing is really able to work. Instead, it all just comes together to tell a remarkably vivid and exciting story, but a story that is deeply fallible and nonsensical. Perhaps a chemical addiction to certain compounds within the spice might add a large omega-3 supplement to a mentat's diet, but it wouldn't give raise them to cognitive brilliance. Nor would copious consumption award clairvoyance to women, or an ability to percieve the universe in a way that enables smooth faster-than-light travel with the aid of a navigator's intuition. It's all wonderfully inventive fantasy, but it's all asinine make-believe when you get right down to it. 

I found that the more I learned about the Dune story through as much investigation into it's continuation as was possible without the task of actually reading the rest of them, I came to the understanding that if I was going to continue enjoying the tale as much as I did the first, then I would suspending disbelief ad nauseum. I give it a free pass in other works of fantasy fiction, and I don't know why. At times I scoff at implausable acts even then, but I think Dune would have pushed me to that limit. I read the first book, and enjoyed it, but since then I've gone in an entirely different approach to my tastes in sci-fi. I took much more of a fancy in the Culture series. At least in the works of Banks, he makes a riveting argument for how intergalactic civilisations made the leap to where they are. He even wrote a book specifically about hyper-inteligent machines coming to terms with an anomaly encountered in space which defied the laws of physics, and what is to be done about it. There is no pseudo-intelectual philosophy. People in Bank's work are curious and flawed, but redeemably professional. It's work hard, play hard. After a while of Dune, I started to feel a bit demoralised by Paul's stern behaviour and absence of character, or character flaws for that matter. Really only the Baron was able to be followed and enjoyed, because he had desires and vices and a careful eye for reading people.

I hope I've made some of my thoughts clear. I mean no ill will whatsoever towards Dune. I found it to be a delightful diversion at the time when I read it, and a small part of me recently actually thought about reading it again, to see if my opinions would change, but I don't feel I have the right set of tastes to get enthusiastic about reading the other books. The plot in Dune could be self-contained with a satisfying conclusion. That is all I feel anyone needs to care about.

I love stories with a massive, detailed world; and lots of factions; and where the protagonist isn’t the centre of that world. Part of the fun for me is figuring out how they all fit together and relate to each other. Dune scratches that itch for me. 

It probably stands out less now than it did at publication, where it was more unique and groundbreaking. I’m sure if I re-read Lord of the Rings I might find that less amazing than when I first read it, for the same reason.

emst3x_4,emst3x,"I read Dune in college and *hated* it. Then I read Dune again last year, at 28, and thought it was middling with some really cool world building. Then I tried to read the 2nd book in the series and found it so bad that I couldn't even finish it. 

I think Dune is an okay book that doesn't deserve nearly as much praise as it gets. The world is interesting but ultimately less full and complex than the fantasy epics it's constantly compared to. The prose is middle school level, the dialogue is hammy to the point of almost transcending to camp, and the pacing is all over the place. 

That said, it's also not a particularly *bad* book. It has a lot of interesting things to say in the subtext, but unfortunately that's where it all stays. It flirts with cool ideas that make your imagination take off, but does a bad job of cultivating those ideas or working them into the themes of the story. 

I think Dune is really accessible because the prose is simple, the plot is easy to follow, it's got some really obvious real world tie ins with the ""fighting for expensive resources in the desert"" schtick, and it's about a teen boy. That's probably its big strength; a book that basically anyone can pick up and get *something* out of.

The Harkonnens also buy into this philosophy, to a lesser extent, by having the noble family fight in Coliseums and other things, to keep them strong. Because that's what makes someone strong according to this book; being miserable and overcoming adversity.

And it only gets worse the further you get.

For me, reading Dune was kind of a... ""zen"" experience. It wasn't exciting at all, it was more meditative.

emst3x_16,emst3x,"Personally, I think the Baron is the worst point of the story. He's evil to the point of being a parody. He's obscenely fat, so much that he's described as being grotesque. Oh, he also happens to be a pedophile. But not just a pedophile, he's a pedophile that lusts after his own nephews. The dude is the kind of evil villain that delights in being evil which is always exceptionally boring. The chapter where he orders Feyd-Ruatha to murder his harem of slave girls as a punishment is the worst chapter in the book, ""Ah shucks Uncle, I sure do love those slave women."" 

His presence in the novel annoys me. I'm fine with absolute evil. It works well in something like Lord of the Rings. But part of the reason why it works is because Sauron's presence is felt everywhere, but he's not an actual character that we the reader become familiar with. It also doesn't help that the majority of the novel is spent with the Fremen who are not subjugated by the Harokkens. So, while the atrocities the Harokken family is committing against the denizens of Dune are implied, they're not really felt. They sure are super duper evil. We just don't get to see it. It’s like writing an evil character by the way of exposition.

x5tzfl_3,x5tzfl,"Dune's just a very grim and serious story, that turns a lot of people off.

Ultimately, it's a book about power. Every faction in the story is pursuing and using power in their own way. 

* The emperor is managing his power base by playing the houses against one another. That's why he throws house Atreides under the bus making them the target of Harkonnen ire.
* The Harkonnen crave power and control over all else. They're ruthless and brutal, relying on spycraft, treachery and naked violence to get what they want.
* The Bene Gesserit try to control the future by creating and fulfilling their own prophecies across the centuries.
* The Fremen create a brutal warrior society that helps them survive Dune and their enemies.
* The spacer guild controls shipping between planets and thus makes everyone dependent on them.
* Even Arakis itself wields power with it's lethal climate and essential spice.

Paul is the protagonist but he's not a hero. Over the course of the book, he's developing his own mastery of power. Everyone he deals with tries to teach him about power in their own way. Whether it's his mother teaching him how to use the voice or his advisors and bodyguards teaching him combat or the ways of spycraft and betrayal.

It all culminates with Paul ultimately upsetting the balance of power as he unleashes the Fremen Jihad and catches all of the various factions unprepared.

I'm not sure what triggered you about it but the whole point is that Paul is not a hero. Dune is a story of many players wielding their power to try and out manoeuvre one another. Through the hardships he suffers on Arakis, Paul masters the power he has to such a degree that he beats everyone in the great and brutal game.",,2022-09-04T21:03:35Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,3

e9ynd1_1,e9ynd1,"One of the things I noticed when I reread Dune is how utterly fascinating it is the way Herbert deals with gender within the novel. I generally don't go in for too heavy-handed social interpretations but all the different sub-societies represented provide a range of ways of dealing with gender. 

The Bene Gesserit are a matriarchal order that are *arguably* sinister (I've got a lot of bones to pick with that idea but I think it comes down to your personal world philosophy) and some of their aspects remind me very much of what has, in a very general sense, been traditionally associated with women: witchcraft, childbearing, veiling, sexual control (in their case, mostly eugenics), etc. This isn't a criticism necessarily since I don't see Herbert as having done this as an unthinking off-the-cuff thing but rather as a specific and intentional codification of some anthropological stereotypes into a conscious mystic order. The Bene Gesserit in the movie also remind me much of the witches in Macbeth.

The noble society that Duke Leto belongs to might initially seem to be pretty normal but from the asides and inferences we can make in the little snippets we get, we can see that gender has a complex role here as well. Lady Jessica is Lady Jessica but she isn't Leto's legitimate wife despite that he loves her. It was important for him to have a son. Furthermore at the end of the book **SPOILERS AHEAD, YO** >!Paul marries Princess Irulan!<**SPOILERS ENDED** as an issue of legitimacy. This is more from hereditary lineage issues and things of that sort than from gender but it is interesting nonetheless that the examples we get of this are all of women being the de/legitimise-r-s. There's a distinct sexism there in that it uses women as tools of state (and I mean, portraying them as tools is obviously wrong regardless of the case but I'm just being specific here) and, despite how there is an element of 'power' present in that the women are required to establish or destroy legitimacy, it's still in a sense of their usefulness or purity or lineage (historically this has meant 'what famous man do you owe genetics to').

The Fremen have a warrior tribal society and, with such a negligible agricultural aspect to their culture, gender is presented as being mostly a practical matter.

And, of course, there's the whole issue of the Kwisatz Haderach and the ""man who can go where the women cannot"" in the Bene Gesserit ideology/science. I've heard a lot of arguments about how this is a bigoted perspective but I find it to be much more subtle than that and more about a hybridisation of gender or an internal balance of the Masculine/Feminine ""principle"" (a popular concept in philosophy for many centuries). I'd even argue that a certain sacrifice Paul makes in the second book **SPOILERS FOR DUNE MESSIAH AHEAD** >!of his eyes!< **SPOILERS FOR DUNE MESSIAH ENDED** are, on one level although not the main level, a metaphor for his abdication of sex, both the act and the designation, as that which was sacrificed has imagery/symbolistic connections to the testes. It's also to be remembered that the very nature of the Bene Gesserit being known and respected (feared, yes, but respected) throughout that universe implies that there being ""knowledge/places where *women* can go and men *cannot* is an accepted fact. 

....but all these are just the thoughts I had rereading Dune as a grown-up. There's without argument out-of-date gender roles and sexual mores in there but I think there's also some interesting gender theory innovations as well. They're just my ideas at the time. They're likely irrelevant and unfounded, it was just interesting how I'd never thought about it in much detail until the reread....",,2019-12-13T05:33:32Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

jhvuqw_1,jhvuqw,"I love and hate your post. I agree and disagree with many of your points.

* To me, there's no way A Song of Ice and Fire is ""pretentious"", despite having a fair amount of depth to *most* elements in the series, it is one of the most accessible adult fantasy series I have read. I may agree with you that fantasy elements are not extremely strong in the books; it reads more like a political thriller than a fantasy. That being said, who are we to dictate the number of fantasy tropes or innovations before it can be a fantasy?
* The Witcher Series is *definitely* pretentious, or at least comes from a place of condescension and perceived authority; you should definitely check out some of the controversial things the author has said and done.
* Dune is for sure science fiction; it's speculative in nature, has hard-science fictional elements like the ecology, lasers, and space travel, but also fiction applied to softer science elements, such as economics, political science and theory. Having an additional focus on fictional humanities does make it lose its classification as Sci-fi. Also is probably the most influential book to the genre. The line between fantasy and sci-fi is razor thin anyway.
* The writing is absolutely dull. I don't think the book is terrible; I think if I had read it when released and the concepts of lasers knives, space travel, giant worms, intergalactic cultures were fresher, I would have really loved and been enthralled by this book. But having read it when these concepts have been run into the ground, the writing, poor world building, and bland characters REALLY stand out. It was a hard read for me. I read *Dead Man's Walk, Comanche Moon, Train Dreams,* and *On Writing* in the same amount of time that it took me to read *Dune,* and it's because there was nothing bringing me back to it.

I'm glad to see more people criticizing it; it had been a sacred child for so long, and anybody who tried to point out obvious flaws got downvoted into oblivion. Now that more people have eyes on it, I feel as though opinions on it have become more varied, or at least criticisms are now stronger supported.",deaner_wiener1,2020-10-26T14:46:11Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

Dune is such a rich franchise with so much to offer, it would be really incredible to see it on a different kind of format again, even though the books are amazing in and of themselves! Personally, I think a Game of Thrones themed TV series would really make the books the best justice.

Brian - I know this is not only a bizarre but also a very personal question to ask but I wonder if you know what was the reason for your father's somewhat bizarre obsession with powerful female mystics with deadly skills and strong sexual undertones?  Many writers introduce elements of semi-erotic fantasies into their writings (some writers build entire successful franchises out of them) and I can't shake the impression that Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres with all their skills and traits were a more creative and fantastic (and let's be honest, very exciting to read) equivalents of what for example... Bruno Schultz  would write about or was it something completely abstract which he created because ""it sounds like fun"".

Our original goal was to write Dune 7 to wrap up the cliffhanger, but first we needed to reignite interest in the Dune universe, which led to the House books, which sold remarkably well worldwide. Then we had to build the foundations of the Butlerian Jihad time period in order to lay the groundwork for Dune 7, and then we finally wrote Hunters of Dune and SandWorms of Dune.  

As for picking up my father's mantle, before writing a single word of new fiction in the universe, I spent five years researching and writing the exhaustive biography of my father, which included rereading ALL of Frank Herbert's works and visiting places he lived. I then spent an additional year creating a huge Dune concordance, which was 600 pages, single-spaced, going into all the details of the Dune characters, settings, etc. in the original novels. That was the best way I could prepare for this massive project...and then I was ready to begin House Atreides with Kevin.

Publishing limitations back then forced the production of three separate volumes.  Read the first three if they hold your interest, then think about whether you want to read the rest.  The first six are the ones Herbert actually wrote.  His son Brian, working with Kevin J. Anderson, has been releaseing prequels and sequels based on Frank's note and outlines that were never written.  Mileage varies on those.  I can't be bothered.

Speaking personally, *Dune* was very much a product of its time.  I first read it in serialized form in Analog Magazine when John W. Campbell was still the editor.  The late John Schoenherr did color covers and wonderful interior illustrations.  It was the 60's, and ecology was the new Big Thing, so it resonated with the audience.  I fear it hasn't aged well for me, as I step back at look at the underlying premises.  The biggest stumbling block is a galactic empire based on Arabian feudalism.  Sorry, but I can't believe such a thing would occur in the first place, let alone persist.  But your mileage may well vary on that.

It's a big and complex enough setting that a concordance may be useful. Dr. Willis E. McNelly compiled one issued as the Dune Encyclopedia by Berkeley Books in 1984. It appears to be still available.  It's ISBN 0-425-06813-7 if you want to look for it. There are also fan websites hosting similar efforts.",cuivenian,2019-04-18T14:39:54Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,8

Seriously tho, first book was A really good piece of SF which probably gets raved about more than it deserves, it was good but not THAT mind blowing. 

The second was okay, it just lacked almost all the charms of the first one. Understandable really, Dune took you down the rabbit hole of a rather unique universe, II was just like ""yeeaaah same place, here's a convoluted story"".

Everything else Dune related was just a massive cash grab. It actually makes me a little sad they keep refilming Dune, even from that generation of SF there's plenty of other stories that would make great movies/shows but they just keep doing it or talking about doing it.

IMO the long term impact of Messiah, the introduction (or at least substantiation) of the T and their capabilities, is overlooked because it gets overshadowed by everything else in the jump from Children to God Emperor. 

Dune and Children of Dune are both traditional scifi stories. Messiah doesn't fit between them because there's no glorious conquest or heroic quest, we see a very tired emperor under constant siege - Herbert was trying to take the story somewhere else and it is a lot more jarring because he returns to the traditional paradigm in Children.",see-bees,2019-04-18T15:26:26Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,12

Part of the reason Herbert wrote more Dune books was that he had things he was trying to say. Another is that editors wanted more.  It's hard to resist writing more in a setting when editors will *pay* you to do it and you write for a living.

As for other things that would make good films, the woods are full of them.  But *making* films costs an *enormous* amount of money.  You see the same thing in films and TV - the stuff most likely to be green lighted is stuff that is assumed to have an audience because it already *sold* before.",cuivenian,2019-04-18T17:40:52Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,14
bej75v_15,bej75v,"Part of the magic of *Dune* is the scope and depth of world building that goes into the first book. None of the other books ever explore something new to that same level of detail - partly because they don't have to, all the heavy lifting was done and partly because it's a lot harder to deep dive into a single world again when you've got a whole universe to explore.

There's also a 15 year time skip from *Dune* to *Dune Messiah*. Where most sci-fi would go from Paul's victory on Arrakis to his conquest of the rest of the universe, instead we pick up again after the war is largely won and over. There are some pockets of resistance and cabals of course, but a lot of readers are jarred by the fact that a lot has changed since we last saw Paul. Everyone we know is as different as you are today from 15 years ago. 

*Children of Dune* follows relatively shortly after *Dune Messiah* and is probably most readers 2nd favorite book. 

All I'm going to say about *God Emperor of Dune* is that it pivots and pivots hard. I don't consider that much to be a spoiler because you'll get a good idea of how much is different in the first 2 chapters of the book. *God Emperor of Dune* is probably the most polarizing book in the series. Either you love it and probably rank it #2 behind the original or hate it and put the series down there.

lxzchf_1,lxzchf,"By sheer coincidence, I just finished a re-read of the first book this morning.

I was introduced to Dune through the 1984 film, and greatly enjoyed both the 2000 Sci-Fi miniseries and the 2003 follow-up.  (I have just this week decided that, while I enjoyed Saskia Reeves's Jessica in the former, Alice Krige's Jessica in the latter feels much more book-accurate.)  It was only at that point that I finally read... the Children of Dune book.  Yes, out of order. 
 Which I liked quite a bit.  Much later I finally read Dune itself, and I've just now completed my first re-read.

For me, there are two things that make Dune compelling: strongly motivated characters (particularly Paul and Jessica); and well-developed themes.  I'm a glutton for themes.  I actually rank theme ahead of both plot and character, in terms of importance for my enjoyment.  I can disagree with the author's thematic conclusions until the cows come home, but if the story does a good job of presenting the themes, it's my favorite thing in the whole world.

Specifically because of that: I. Love. Dune.

But it's not for everyone, and that's okay!  Ignore the downvoters.

Not everyone cares about themes as much as I do, and there's no _wrong_ way to read a work of fiction, because we bring ourselves when we read and there's a frankly unlimited diversity of life experiences out there.  Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations, as my fellow Star Trek nerds say.

Anyway, the big theme that I identified in this read-through was:

> Which is preferable? Doing the cruel-but-right thing, or doing the compassionate-but-wrong thing?

... which was broken into two big sub-themes. One:

> When we use our detailed knowledge of the world and its consequences to achieve results -- behave ""as humans"", as the Bene Gesserit would put it -- we sometimes have to discard the agency of others, which is cruel, and oppose our ""animal"" passions, including compassion. Is this necessary, acting as a ""human"" at all times, never giving in to our ""animal"" nature even when the ""human"" way is the cruel one? Are the Bene Gesserit right to do this, and consequently is Paul right to do this?

Two:

> Predictability leads to peace, but also to stagnation and to death; while unpredictability leads to cruelty, but also to change and to life.  Can we ever have both peace and life?  Must we always choose between them, and must we always choose life and consequently cruelty?

I love it.  These are _big_ thematic questions, and they're very well-developed with multiple examples of each woven through the plot and setting.  I disagree with almost every word of them!  I reject their foundational axioms, but reading Dune makes me think *big thoughts* and I gain an immense amount of reading pleasure from that.",,2021-03-05T21:09:15Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,1

It's simultaneously about religion, prophecy, prescience, institutional manipulation and corruption, humanity, cultural development, physical and mental human development, sexuality... the list goes on and on.  

It's one of the most literary sci-fi series I've ever read.  Herbert takes himself very seriously, so there can be some eye-roll moments.  Lots of internal monologue and characters speaking in thesis statements... but if you don't mind that kind of thing, the books are amazing.  

Stay away from Brian Herbert's novels though... or if you read them, just treat them like bad fan-fiction.

Westwood actually made the dune cnc style game in 1992....before they made command and conquer in 1995. I would argue that Dune's sandworms inspired a whole generation of real time strategy games, though there was already a board game in '79 or so. Many great science fiction gets turned into movies/games because the concepts as story elements are so strong. Few are as strong as sandworms and the desert people which come up often in other works.

I read it again at 25; It was filled with intrigue, mysticism, spirituality, and political power plays.  Throw in a tough-but-marginalized people, and a messiah that rides giant worms, and you have a truly epic story, bordering on *biblical*.

I read it again at 40; It was a story of one family/corporate concern fighting to get control of an essential commodity from another corporate/family concern by using the quaint mythology of a somewhat backward people that can ride sandworms to do their fighting and dying for them.

Dune is all of those things and more, and I don't know if Frank Herbert would agree with my interpretations or not, but I saw the book differently every time I read it.

3neyfz_2,3neyfz,"I've posted this before in this sub, and I'll post it again: *Dune* is an incredibly important, revolutionary book that inspired many, many people.  The sci-fi/fantasy world and the larger fiction world are better for its existence.

But I don't like the book, and I didn't enjoy reading it.  I think it's a lot of really fantastic, interesting, intricate ideas all jammed into a novel that isn't well-written, isn't paced properly, and is too short to deal with most of those things in an effective way.  It's particularly annoying how [tons and tons of major characters are all introduced in the first several chapters, all their detailed personality and backstory is given, and then half of them die unexpectedly within the span of ~5 pages.](/s ""tons and tons of major characters are all introduced in the first several chapters, all their detailed personality and backstory is given, and then half of them die unexpectedly within the span of ~5 pages."")  There's also just the issue that [such a huge deal is made of the fact that Atreides is relocating to Arrakis and that it will be such a massive undertaking that will change the whole political fabric of the galaxy, and then a massive deal is made of Harkonnen's treacherous plans only for everything to play out with painfully little detail in the span of a few pages.](/s ""such a huge deal is made of the fact that Atreides is relocating to Arrakis and that it will be such a massive undertaking that will change the whole political fabric of the galaxy, and then a massive deal is made of Harkonnen's treacherous plans only for everything to play out with painfully little detail in the span of a few pages."")

So much of the book just feels incredibly anticlimactic.  All of this detailed setup is given to these people and environments only for literally a *tiny fraction* of it to matter whatsoever for the remaining 3/4 of the book.  Sure, you can say it's world-building, but why on earth should I care about the world you're building if 99% of my focus is going to be on one small part of it?

Anyway, to avoid ranting too much, yeah, I didn't like it.  I get that it's important, and I think everyone should absolutely read it simply because of how influential and important it is, but I think it's perfectly reasonable to expect *not* to like it as much as it is to expect to be blown away by it.",nova_cat,2015-10-04T17:06:24Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,2

[spoilers for anyone who hasn't read Dune yet is reading this thread asking if they liked it or not](#s ""He doesn't want any of the power that he does have -  he just thinks it makes him a freak and he's trapped by his visions of the future. What he wants is to just live a peaceful life as Duke with Chani as his wife and some kids and an orderly, lawfully administered world.
What does he get - father murdered, friends murdered or lost to him, on the run, forced to kill a stranger, joins a strange bunch of people in the desert, then is put on a weird pedestal as Mahdi which comes with all kinds of demands and dangers, little sister damaged before birth, hunted by the Harkonnen, first son murdered, forced to fight a major battle, forced to fight a duel to the death, takes the throne which begins a jihad that rages across the galaxy and slaughters millions, has to marry a stranger.
He's completely trapped by his visions of the future. It's only hinted at in the first book, but what he's sees coming is something terrible. He has to do what he does, no matter how awful, because the alternative is even worse."")

Also, I find the entire universe of Dune to be fascinating. From the ancient history of a war against machines to the development of different techniques to increase human mental abilities to the various cultures of the settled planets and of course the planet of Dune itself with it's unique ecology.

I have the first six books, and read them every year or two. Paul's story just resonates with me for no reason that I can really articulate well. He was placed into an extremely harsh situation, and instead of running performed the best example of ""going native"" that there has even been.

I also get a big nerdboner for prophecies and the messianic complex, and Herbert's examination of both in this novel and future ones (particularly *Dune Messiah, Children of Dune*, and then *God Emperor of Dune*) is fantastic.

Herbert was intuitive and thoughtful about the world he created. He describes it through the characters interactions with it.
The scifi elements are far flung enough to be interesting but because the whole thing is driven by fundamental human drives it is very relatable.
I think that as user above commented, it is a tragedy of circumstance; perhaps an illustration of the limits of power.

they did that in the early 2000's, there was a tv miniseries adaptation of the first three books. imo, it was ok though I preferred the Lynch movie. will be nice to see the story on the big screen again with a different vision anyway.",Disparition_523,2020-09-29T01:01:54Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Dune,16
j1k7xf_17,j1k7xf,"The first Dune book is ~188,000 words while the first two foundation books are ~147,000 (all three being ~218K).

But Dune is a much more complete story in one book. Foundation could perhaps had ended at book one but the next two are part in parcel.",Geronimobius,2020-09-30T19:50:37Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,17
j1k7xf_18,j1k7xf,"I agree that Dune because of its, for a lack of a better term, ""scale"" will be very difficult to convert to film.

I would like someone to take Lawrence of Arabia's pacing and cinematography and make Dune version.",Geronimobius,2020-09-30T19:57:23Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,18
j1k7xf_19,j1k7xf,"I agree with what you're saying (aside from your points about the Dune sequels -- I haven't read them, so can't comment), but have you actually watched the trailer or read up on what it's likely going to entail?

>But while the novels are decidedly hard science-fiction stories, short on action and long on intellect, Apple+’s description of *Foundation*  makes it sound like the show might be a bit less literary. According to  their press materials, the show “chronicles a band of exiles on their  monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the  fall of the Galactic Empire,” **which suggests this series will follow the  spirit of the novels more than the letter**.  
>  
>**It’s also doubtful, given the scope and the 10-episode order (so far), that** ***Foundation*** **will cover all three books. It may not even cover all of the first one,**  , especially if they incorporate elements of Asimov’s prequel novels, 1988’s *Prelude to Foundation* and 1993’s *Forward the Foundation*. But with the credentials of the people involved, we’re hopeful that Goyer and Apple will be able to pull it off.

Having read the latter and watched the former, I honestly see little reason to be optimistic about the Foundation TV show.  I wouldn't mind being proven wrong, but I doubt that's going to happen.",OrgMartok,2020-09-30T06:32:59Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,19
j1k7xf_20,j1k7xf,"I highly recommend reading both. I've read Dune twice, and the first three Foundation books once. Really worth it, great books.",Desvelo,2020-09-29T03:33:17Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Dune,20
j1k7xf_21,j1k7xf,I agree.  The cast of Dune just does not do it for me.,TheAgentX,2020-09-29T05:01:37Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Dune,21
j1k7xf_22,j1k7xf,"But we're not talking about a general audience. We're talking about /r/movies, where Denis is god and BR2049 is the peak of all cinema.

Regardless, pretty much all the noise I heard about Dune prior to casting and trailers was about the director. And while vast, billion dollar movies aren't necessarily driven by director star power, there are still directors who can make bank on name recognition. I agree that it's not enough to assure success, even Tarantino can't get over 400m with his name alone.",jojoman7,2020-09-30T04:28:28Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Dune,22
