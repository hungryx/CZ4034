1alsfo2_6,1alsfo2,"I read *Catch-22* multiple times in high school. I was fascinated by it, and liked it, but didn't really *get it.* I kept reading it hoping that I decode it, figure out why it effected me so much, and fascinated me so much. Every time I read it, I would see something else, but I still couldn't really explain why it had the effect on me that it did.

And then I read David Milch's memoir last year (Milch is a TV writer most famous for *Deadwood* and *NYPD Blue*) and he wrote this passage about a class on writing that he used to teach at Yale:

> What I was trying to teach was the idea that the reader or the audience's experience of a work, how they feel as they go through it, is what conveys the work's argument, and that experience is usually different from the actual words. Another way of saying it is that form shapes content. With *Moby-Dick,* your faculties of understanding are exhausted by the work itself, and it's by having your faculties totally and utterly exhausted that you can feel Ahab's obession with the whale and Ishmael's obsession with the story. ""I'm taking it all in and I'm overwhelmed and I'm still not sure exactly what it means."" That's what it means. Henry James uses a different tactic--he introduces a new character to the world and then through that character's misapprehension the reader comes to apprehend the world more clearly.
>
> This was a writing class, but I went into it through reading. It's too much for a young student to constantly be looking at their or their classmates' work. If you bring something already taken for granted as literature and you workshop that, then we can have some fun. To suggest that our greatest writers might have been struggling with our same feelings, which we know for a fact they were, is a good thing for a writer to live into. There are ways to turn problems of spirit into problems of technique--that's another kind of indirection. Kafka was just a miserable, miserable human being. Pathologically shy and physically ill, but he wanted to tell stories. So Gregor Samsa woke up and discovered he was a bug. All of his misery is now a problem of technique. How does a bug live in a family where the rest are human beings?

And I get it. I understand the structure and impact of Catch 22 so much better than before.

1alsfo2_17,1alsfo2,"Catch-22 might be the greatest book of the last 100 years in my opinion. The only “flaw” it has is it isn’t as broadly relatable to non-veterans or people who’ve dealt with bureaucracy but if you have? It’s simply transcendent. 

I really think Heller is an author that is due for a serious reappraisal. Largely overshadowed by Vonnegut (who is also very good, but maybe a tad overrated in the way Nirvana’s mass appeal overshadowed better bands like Soundgarden or AIC). 

Also, Hulu did a big budget Catch-22 miniseries a few years ago with George Clooney co-producing, Hugh Laurie, Kyle Chandler, etc. that was quite honestly the best war series since Band of Brothers imho. Highly recommend.",Bergy4Selke37,2024-02-13T02:39:55Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,17
1alsfo2_18,1alsfo2,"> Told by an interviewer that he had never produced anything else as good as Catch-22, Heller famously responded, ""Who has?""

Catch-22 is one of the main reasons I have trouble reading books today. Not so much trouble as that I never read books—I still read books. But I grew up only reading the great books. At home and in school, every book we read was a classic, something spectacular. 

Well, most books aren't spectacular, aren't classics, obviously. Many of them are very good, and very entertaining, but once I'd gone through many of the classics and was trying to find other books to read, I was let down a lot. Every book I pick up, I expect to be The Hobbit, or Catch-22, or One Hundred Years of Solitude, or All Quiet on the Western Front. Of course they can't all be that, but I am always disappointed. 

Not every movie I see has to be Breaker Morant or Fitzcarraldo. Not every TV show has to be The Prisoner or Faulty Towers. Maybe because I grew up watching good and bad movies, serious and silly movies and shows, mediocre ones as well. My expectations are realistic. But with books, they were all amazing. And my expectations were set very high. I didn't read a ""bad"" book until after college.

I wish there were other books out there that I somehow missed (and maybe there are) so I could experience them like /u/MaidenlessRube experienced this.",xerxespoon,2024-02-08T20:44:06Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,18

188tsot_3,188tsot,"Catch-22 is probably my favorite book, but I will fully admit that it is not for everyone. There is not any sort of great narrative shift where it turns into a linear story, so, if you are waiting for that, temper your expectations :) (and maybe it just isn't the book for you. Nothing wrong with that).

But!!!

While the style remains the same, it is kind of like puzzle pieces that are randomly dropping into place. After 12% of the pieces fall, you look at it and say ""WTF is this, it makes no sense"". But as more and more of the puzzle pieces fall, they are still random, but they begin to fill in the picture, and you see more and more of the whole. And as you get to the end it all comes together and you see all these interconnected parts that were randomly dropped in.

This is how it happened to me, at least, and I loved it, and it was a hilarious ride getting there. But as I said, not everyone has the same experience. If you are only 12% of the way in, I would recommend giving it another little bit until you are at least 20% or 30%. If you still think it is terrible, drop it. Like I said, it isn't for everyone.

The other advice I would give is to not view it as a ""running joke about how crazy everyone is"". The characters aren't crazy; they are living in a crazy situation, and it affects all of them differently. A good example that comes to mind is Yossarian's argument with Clevinger about how ""Everyone is trying to kill him"". Depending on your point of view, either Yossarian or Clevinger (or both) seem crazy. But actually neither of them say anything that isn't true.

wr2kpx_1,wr2kpx,"I think may be reading *just* a bit too far into it.  But I also don't think Heller would be upset about your conclusions.  I believe he was interested in writing a book that had broad themes and satire and could be used as small spotlight on any absurd issue.

Just a note on Sweden.  It was not socialist at the time, nor is it socialist today.  It is a social democracy which is based on capitalism.  The role Sweden plays in the book is more general and mainly that Sweden is *neutral* and wants no part of the war, which is how Yossarian himself feels.  

The book itself is a broad satire and in general is about the extreme absurd-ism that is the military and bureaucracy.  It points out the concept of promoting problems up (ie it is easier to promote someone to get rid of them, then it is to actually remove them), miscommunication, ego, greed, etc.  

Then the ultimatum theme is personal integrity vs institution.  Yossarian tries to follow personal integrity and he looks for it in others, but he keeps coming up against the institution with it's ""Catch-22"".  Only the institution really gets to use Catch-22 though, individuals are always at the whim of the institution and are not able to use Catch-22.  The is really the main point and the book goes out of its way to keep selling that point.

The Sellout, My Year of Rest and Relaxation, Lightning Rods, Then We Came to the End, Money, Portnoy's Complaint, American Psycho... I think all of these are very funny books. They have laugh-out-loud moments and they have the more intellectual ""huh, that's really funny"" kind of conceptual moments, with the balance being different for each book.

(Note: there is one book on the NYTimes list that I have read and I think is decidedly not funny, but I won't be rude and shame it here.)

The problem is: humor is subjective. I'm sure lots of people don't think the books I've listed are funny. That doesn't mean they *aren't* funny. And the fact that I find them funny doesn't mean they *are* funny. In fact, I know a lot of people who don't think Catch-22 is funny.

I thought so too when I first read Catch-22, but now, having read it a second time just recently, I have to disagree. That Catch-22 feels arbitrary and not coherent is really a testament to how well-structured it is. 

It can seem convoluted at first read, but really it isn't all that confusing. The first sequence of chapters takes place in the present, then the book flashes back to the big bombing of Bologna, then it jumps forward back to the narrative present, then flashes back, then flashes forward, climaxing with another flashback back to the death of Snowden, which haunts Yossarian throughout. 

This sequence of events allows Heller to keep Catch-22 light and absurd, all while consistently ramping up the darkness at the heart of the book. By the time of the sudden murder of the sex worker in Italy, it's almost like getting a bucket of cold water thrown in your face

Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to.

tx68jt_3,tx68jt,"""Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane *if* he didn't \[...\]""

A clever detail about the writing here is that Heller has hidden the fact that this is a conditional statement by burying the ""if"" until later sentences. 

Notice how the end of the paragraph is littered with the word ""if"", as if snowballing:

""...but *if* he was sane he had to fly them. *If* he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but *if* he didn't want to he was sane and had to.""

It builds wonderful tension because we get more frustrated with each condition!

""Orr was crazy and could be grounded."" really isn't being *asserted* as a statement of fact, but Heller's gone out of his way to make it *appear* so in order to create an element of surprise. 

If the statement ""Orr was crazy and could be grounded"" were true then Orr would also have to be able to be grounded, which the book makes clear he isn't because of Catch-22. 

Orr *might* be crazy given that statement *if* it weren't for the paradoxical nature of the Catch-22.

Because the Catch-22 has no resolution, it's always resolved in the favor of those in power, so Orr factually is never grounded, and therefore the conjunction that ""Orr was crazy and could be grounded"" is false.

Therefore, we can't make any inference about the atomic statement ""Orr is crazy"".

jomuc0_1,jomuc0,"I read it in college and while I definitely didn't ""hate"" it, I wasn't taken by it. Much of what people in this thread have noted about repetitiveness has been said, but I'll agree with it. Being intentionally tedious isn't much better than unintentionally tedious. And the same joke premise gets stale no matter how funny it is.

I also think I don't connect to the style/themes of the book very strongly. Absurdism rarely works for me as a reader; it makes it hard for me to care. I found it similarly frustrating to read Slaughterhouse 5, another Reddit favorite. Absurdist lit just feels cynical in a very unlikable way. It asks the reader to do work in parsing the story, but ultimately the reward for the work is a middle finger, because the story will never really make total sense. I understand that this is a sort of meta-commentary on the painful needlessness of war, but it's not a ride I feel like signing myself up on.

To be clear, I don't think Catch-22 is a ""bad book"". It has real humor and intelligence and ideas, and even I enjoyed moments of it. I just find it difficult to connect to on the whole. I'm more than willing to read a bleak war novel, but the hyper-jaded, sardonic narrator felt too unlikable for me to connect with emotionally and too repetitive for me to invest in intellectually.",Jamarcus_Hustle,2020-11-05T20:33:49Z,0,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,1

I think most people read the first chapter or two and assume that this is a flaw in the writing, not an intentional technique and give up too early.

There was an animated movie in the early 2000s (Hoodwinked) that used a similar storytelling technique and I thought it was great but no matter who I loaned the DVD to, they invariably said they just couldn't get into it. I think they watched the first part and when it went back to the beginning of the story to tell it from another character's point of view, they somehow felt like it had tricked them or wasted their time.

However I'm wondering about one thing. Is Snowden's >!death!< widely considered the climax of the book? Because I don't think it really is. It's just there to put the actual emotional climax of the book, the >!raping and killing of prostitute!< by the good old Aarfy in Rome is the actual climax of the book. The Snowden bit is there to put it all into perspective. The sheer absurdity of considering one being innocent or guilty in the time of war, human life having no value (they're all pretty much there to go through the moves), it all comes to a climax during that one last trip to Rome.

And I believe the reason people tend to miss this on their first reading is because it's IMMEDIATELY undercut by the military police taking Yossarian into custody due to him being AWOL.

It forces you to deal with the pattern of life and it uncompromisingly compares the harshness of war with the harshness of banal domestic life. 

I would say Catch-22 captures the chaotic, bizarre, weirdly humorous world of war where nothing makes sense once you start questioning and you just don't understand it.

o6zf61_38,o6zf61,"Well, it's boot camp, which can be considered 8 weeks of engineered hazing. That's just how it is. It's all about being uncomfortable, doing only what you've been told to do, and purposeful chaos. The training isn't designed to make you happy, it's to get you ready for life in the military, which means the possibility of being in war, which is uncomfortable and chaotic. To be fair, we did get to occasionally wear the raincoats, but it had to be a heavy rain, and we had to be outside in it for quite a while before they'd tell us to put them on.   


The blanket situation really was a Catch-22 deal. It really wasn't a blanket (they called it that), it was an extra sheet. And it had to be rolled into something like a plank of wood, very precisely, and kept it a very specific manner at the foot of the bed when not in use. We found out quickly that there just wasn't enough time to perform this exercise in origami every morning. From the time reveille sounded, we had exactly 12 minutes to get up, use the toilet, shave, brush our teeth, get dressed (including lacing up canvas WW2 style leggings-this was in the '80s), make our rack (bunk), and be outside in formation, ready to march to breakfast. This is 80 guys all doing this and trying to use 2 toilets and 2 sinks (we had more of both, but didn't use them so that we didn't have to clean all of them). So, taking the 2 or 3 minutes to get that damn sheet just right wasn't in the cards. It was better to shiver all night than to not make it to muster. At sea, you have 12 minutes to make it to your battle station from the moment the general quarters alarm sounds. At 12 minutes, all the watertight doors are sealed, and if you didn't make it through that last door and to your station, it's...a big deal. So, this 12 minute time frame is something the Navy is serious as shit about, and it was practiced every morning in boot camp.",tomcat_tweaker,2021-06-24T23:40:35Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,38

If you've ever worked anywhere that has a lot of management, you'll understand this book immediately.

I would keep going a little longer. There may be certain things you need to understand about the book in order to 'get' it. Think about how all the characters and situations represent aspects of life that are absurd: see if you can apply them to situations in your own life. It's a funny book, but think carefully about the serious messages about society and war that lie underneath all the silliness.

That said, if and when you do give up, I'd recommend returning to it later in life. There are so many wonderful ideas within it just waiting for you to discover, but perhaps you're not at quite the right time to fully appreciate them.

So just sit back, enjoy the ride, and rest assured that Yossarian's fate is utterly meaningless.

In terms of style, it is about the most brilliant, original and intricately crafted thing I've ever come across. About a third of the way in I found myself regretting not having drawn a map as I went of everyone's relationship to everyone else.
While most narratives have a strictly linear feeling, Catch-22 is more like a *web*. That's the best way I can describe it, both in terms of plot and characters. Events and personalities are gradually strung together into a grand interconnected network to reveal the final picture. It's rather amazing.

The dark humour was mostly very effective, and the negative take on war moved me far more than Slaughterhouse 5 did.

One gripe was that the Milo Minderbinder side plot unexpectedly drags what is a plausible story (up to that point) into complete absurdity. *SPOILER ALERT* I'm talking about the part where Yossarian finds out Milo is the emperor and mayor etc of all these places. Milo's airstrike on the base also annoyed me in that he suffered no repercussions. I know it's in line with Heller's portrayal of war as insane, but it begged too great a suspension of disbelief.

We have Minderbinder bombers in Catch-22, in real life we have GE torpedoes.

It belies the amorality of the whole enterprise. The power that Milo amasses is also similar to the power that corporations amass. They have control far beyond anything they should, and that is Milo in spades.

It's also a great take on war, especially a war that is remembered as the last ""just war"". The 2 things that really stick with me are Yossarian pondering why all these people he's never met are trying to kill him, and the entire conversation with the old italian man talking about how the Italians survived and tried to minimize their own losses. It's a great statement on what many percieve as cowardice but in reality it's just survival.

I just want to clarify that I'm not saying that old books weren't funny. I found ""Journey to the West"" pretty funny and that's like several centuries old. When I said I was surprised by how humourous Catch-22 was, I was referring to the style of the humour. It bears a close resemblance to *'21st Century Humour'*.

These are not easy things to pick up on, necessarily. I might recommend putting it down until you have a greater understanding of the language. But don't give up on it just yet!

The nameless, faceless person is probably talking about 'Dunbar' who they 'disappeared'. There is no real reason for it. As Yossarian says, it isn't even good English. 

""Nately's Whore"" is less symbolic. She is meant to be a person, not a faceless figure. Someone who lost her love; and as Yossarian supposes, needs someone to hate about it. 
 
The key to Catch-22 is the return again and again to Snowden, dying, and what Yossarian realized staring at the ripped open body:  ""The spirit dead, man is garbage.""

Nately's Whore saved Yossarian by almost killing him, making him face the fact that selling out to Korn and Cathcart would destroy his spirit. He'd be dead, in the only sense that justifies being alive.

j6x4a_1,j6x4a,"That was pretty well written, and Rosenbaum's esteem for the novel is palpable, but I disagree with his point. Primarily I feel that this deconstruction, which claims to basically reclassify the novel thematically, is a little weak. I mean, Rosenbaum would have us believe that the book is primary about a theme which only appears explicitly in one chapter, with no other exposition the author can find? I guess you could say that Heller had to set the mood in order for his message to be received but that is a stretch that I would hasten to call 'intellectually bankrupt'. Sure, the whole theistic argument is in the book and it may be a small theme but I think it is connected to a larger issue that Ron as well as most people miss about the book. 

Catch-22 isn't so much about the war, or about morality, as it is about (as Rosenbaum even eludes to) authority, an hierarchies. Even if you want to discuss the theme of morality that is definitely still in the novel you have to understand that Yossarian isn't supposed to be a paragon in the classic sense. Yossarian is a hero not because he does what is morally right, but because he is the person who is deciding, from his point of view, what is right. Not anyone else, Yossarian.

No novel that I know so successfully blends all these disparate moods. I believe it was Hugh Walpole who wrote, ""Life is a comedy to those who think, and a tragedy to those who feel."" No book illustrates that better than this novel. This truly is one of the funniest books I have ever read. It is also one of the most tragic.

CATCH-22 also introduces one of the most insane collection of great characters in fiction: Yossarian, the Chaplain, Orr, ex-P.F.C Wintergreen, Milo Minderbender, Maj. Major Major Major, Nately, Doc Daneeka, Danby, General Dreedle, Nately's girl (not the description in the book, but Amazon's software will bleep it), Cathcart, Nurse Duckett, The Texan, Major ----- de Coverley, The Soldier in White, and a host of other characters. It is one of the most gloriously populated novels of the past half century.

This is a novel I can almost not discuss except through superlatives: greatest war novel I have read, funniest novel I have ever read, greatest English language novel of the past 60 years.

They told him never to put off until the next day what he could do the day before, and he never did. He was told to honor his father and his mother, and he honored his father and his mother. He was told that he should not kill, and he did not kill, until he got into the Army. Then he was told to kill, and he killed. He turned the other cheek on every occasion and always did unto others exactly as he would have had others do unto him. When he gave to charity, his left hand never knew what his right hand was doing. He never once took the name of the Lord his God in vain, committed adultery or coveted his neighbor's ass. In fact, he loved his neighbor and never even bore false witness against him.

24cy6z_25,24cy6z,"At the risk of committing the grave sin of Explaining The Joke, the dialog is actually about a very profound difference in world views.

Yossarian's view is simple: people are shooting at me, ergo they are trying to kill me.

His adversary (don't remember his name) is trying to explain that it's not murder but war, and that they're not trying to kill Yossarian specifically, but any US soldier.

To Yossarian, this distinction is immaterial: call it war or murder, call him Yossarian or ""any US soldier"", he's still ending up dead.

Yossarian is right of course, but the army (and society at large) doesn't want him to think that way and tries to present his risk of getting killed in some formal and rephrased way, to make it sound OK. The other guy completely buys into this view and gets exasperated by Yossarian's straightforward and undeniable logic.

In high school, my English teacher gave me a good grade for pointing out that Catch-22 is not just about war, the military and death; it's about society in general and about conformism. I think you can apply Yossarian's logic to lots of things in your daily life (and drive the non-Yossarians of this world to despair while doing so).",zeptimius,2014-05-02T09:39:27Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,25

It does a great job capturing the atmosphere of claustrophobia and terror, but the humor falls almost completly flat. At first, I wondered why that is, I thought the funny dialogues were already in the book. But now I think the rythm of the dialogues can't be reproduced on film. Much of the humor depends on ""catch"" phrases beeing repeated verbatim, but changing their meaning everytime. Sometimes the same phrases are repeated right back several times in one conversation.

A reader needs less time each repetition to read the words of the text; he already knows the sentence. He has more time to ponder the changing of tone or meaning. This makes the reading of the dialogues fast and funny. But when said aloud, each repetition takes the same time as before. As the Mike Nichols movie shows, this makes the dialogues extremely slow. The humour loses its rythm, that is to say, the humour is lost. The Nichols movie tried to compensate this by a frantic, overwinded delivery. Needless to say, it doesn't work. So an adaption would have to change what is imo the most important stylistic device of the book to have a chance at being funny. ",gromolko,2014-03-23T18:49:47Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,1

1xh8cx_1,1xh8cx,"I read Catch-22 for the first time when I was around that age as well (for the exact same reason actually lol). It's definitely not the easiest read because his style and humour are a bit unorthodox, and all the repetition can get confusing. Despite that, it is an excellent, and totally doable challenge and you will be very glad you chose it by the end. 

A lot of times when I am reading a difficult or dense book, I'll have dictionary.com or something open. It's immeasurably helpful for fully understanding what's happening. If you come across a word you don't understand, you can usually infer its meaning from the context, but a lot of times it's more ambiguous. This way you get an actual definition, and you're increasing your vocabulary. It can be especially helpful if I'm reading something written even like 50+ years ago. Certain words, especially common vernacular, come in and out of fashion almost as fast as clothes. So it can be difficult to get the full context with something written just a few decades ago. A quick search can clear up a lot of confusion.

**tl:dr** The dictionary is your friend!

1xh8cx_2,1xh8cx,"Way to go! This is one of my favorite books and I've read it several times, each time learning something new. Often, the most difficult books are written in a way that deviates from traditional linearity or reliable narrator styles (if you're looking for a challenge try a book written with a stream of consciousness narrative). Here, remember that Catch-22 is not written with a linear timeline, but rather from the perspective of a different individual in each chapter. In the end, everyone's chapter should add up to a cohesive story. This book is hilarious and I find that it gets more entertaining and poignant  with every read.

If you're reading for the characters and dialogue instead of some big, overarching, unifying narrative, I think you will find the book to be much more enjoyable.

90okad_8,90okad,"Catch-22 was one of the few assigned classics that I fell in love with in high school. That being said, I have two comments on why you may not enjoy it as I did. First, and I saw something similar in an earlier post, the “classic” tag can set many up for failure. Classic seems to indicate a universal love and respect for a work, when honestly I feel that the adjective is bantered about too recklessly. I work at a bookstore and had a discussion about a supposed “classic” with a customer. She said, “...but its a CLASSIC!” To which I replied, “Why is it a classic?” “Because it ENDURED.” And again I questioned, “Yes, but perhaps it has only endured because it was labeled classic and people think that they must read it.” My point is, I think the term classic is subjective. I honestly detest most commonly considered classics. I mean seriously, Hemingway? I’ll fight you over that one. I threw Joseph Conrad across the room in the middle of class. 
Secondly, back to Catch-22, its a comedy, dark, satirical, dry humor. If there is anything in this world more subjective than humor, I’m not sure what it is. If the book doesn’t work for you, there are a few million others to choose from. 
Ona side note- for those who read this and are fans of the book- try Nick Harkaway’s amazing The Goneaway World. You will thank me. Very similar construction and texture. ",RobertKenton,2018-07-21T12:30:02Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,8

It is not what one might call high literature, and didn't get particularly good reviews, but was an underground hit nonetheless.   It is very much rooted in the Cold War fears of the 50's and early 60's in the U.S.  Have you seen the movie *Dr. Srangelove*?

Exactly. Like the old guy says, ""It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees."" 

At the time of this story, everyone romanticized war. Sure, other authors also wrote against its horrors (Remarque, Hemingway, Trumbo,) but most of hollywood and the general population loved to glorify war as dying for your country and bravery, while Keller wrote about just how brutal it really is. 

He wants to say that people should not try to be heroes in war. It's random and pointless and crazy and you're lucky to just be alive for how long you have been. Yossarian finally realizes he can't just not do anything about his situation. He has to get out of this before his luck runs out.

There is no happy ending that one guy can create. Yossarian cannot win the war. He can't get out of it legally because of Catch-22.

brtuao_1,brtuao,"Spoilers, maybe? - but anybody in this thread must have read the book already, I hope.

  
Catch-22 is my favorite book, and one I was very cautiously optimistic to see adapted by Hulu. I've seen the movie version before and found it low-energy, but mostly faithful to the plot. Hulu's miniseries is kind of the opposite - it's high energy and very well acted, but takes some big liberties with the plot to keep the themes intact. I think our present-day culture has pretty much internalized the whole ""War is Hell"" concept and so the show lands in a very different place socially than the book did, when criticizing the military was far edgier a stand to take. Overall I liked the Hulu series as a stand-alone work, but the differences between the book and the show bothered me more than I hoped they would. I think it gets the broad strokes of Heller's ideas/themes right but does so at the expense of a lot of the nuance that the book contains. Things are just too pat, too cause-and-effect, and you lose the chaotic sense of ambiguity that the book forces you to navigate with its scattered, scrambled chronology. The show makes it seem like there is a clear villain, while the book makes it more like a faceless system that is to blame. Both are still respectable and high-quality, but for different reasons IMO.",wrdmaster,2019-05-22T21:46:10Z,0,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,1

Heller was examining how it is practically impossible for the everyday wo/man to come up against the powers that be and try to get something accomplished, or change something for what he or she deems as the better.  

The book, as enjoyable as it was, was infuriating, and I couldn't help but feel like an awful cynical bastard for a period of time after reading it. It had a similar effect on me as did Kafka's The Trial.

>Major Major’s father was a sober God-fearing man whose idea of a good joke was to lie about his age. He was a longlimbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism. He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn’t earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major’s father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money and was therefore wise. “As ye sow, so shall ye reap,” he counseled one and all, and everyone said, “Amen.”

>Major Major’s father was an outspoken champion of economy in government, provided it did not interfere with the sacred duty of government to pay farmers as much as they could get for all the alfalfa they produced that no one else wanted or for not producing any alfalfa at all. He was a proud and independent man who was opposed to unemployment insurance and never hesitated to whine, whimper, wheedle and extort for as much as he could get from whomever he could.

I've read Catch-22 twice, once in college and once when I was in my 30s, and my view of it was very different. In college, I thought it was hilariously funny. In my 30s, I was stunned to find that it was a depressing statement on the state ofwars and the nations that inflict them. There's a _lot_ more there than the comedy. In my very humble opinion, it's a good book if you read it as a comedy, and it's a very good book if you read through the comedy to the premise Heller starts with.

May I suggest that instead of ""getting it"" we switch frames and ask if the book is speaking to you. Picasso just doesn't speak to me, so I don't ""get"" his works. If Heller's book isn't speaking to you, it's just not meant for you as the reader. No reflection on Heller, no reflection on you. You might wait 10 or 15 years and see if it speaks to you then.

Art is a dialogue, I digress to say. The author ""vests"" his painting, play, novel, whatever, with himself. He speaks to us through his work. But we bring our own train of baggage with us when we view, watch, read the author's work. We fund the work with our own knowledge, history, and experiences. If the author's self and our selves match to some extent, if we can fund the work as he vested it, then through the work of art, the author and we have a conversation. We fund -- fill in the blanks -- the work with ourselves, as the author vested the work with himself. If there's no match ([Picasso and me](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064808/combined)), there's no conversation.

If Heller isn't speaking to you through ""Catch-22,"" then let it go for now and do something better with your time.",civex,2012-01-15T19:26:34Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,1

1fa73l_7,1fa73l,"Hi!

I don't mean to intrude, but...

I think Heller means that the novel uses the same characters, but the story itself is not an expansion on Catch-22's story. The events of Catch-22-- Aarfy killing the whore, the founding of Milo & Minderbinder enterpises--still happened in the same universe, but this story hasn't anything to do with these events. Sure, the characters are the same, but their actions are not directly related to the events in Catch-22, which is why Heller has labeled Closng Time as a continuation rather than a sequel.

Could the definition of sequel sill incorporate Heller's continuation? Maybe. However, joshthecynic was not contesting you on that point. Specifically, he said that Heller was not trying to sell Closing Time as a sequel. Whther or not it actually was a sequel is irrelevant to what Josh was saying. What matters is what Heller was trying to sell.

660gmm_1,660gmm,"Welcome to *Catch-22*! It's a book I've read at least a dozen times and I could happily read it again tonight.

The chapters are short, so you're not very far in, but if you're getting a feeling of craziness, you're on the right track. 

I'll try not to spoil anything for you, you haven't even met Catch-22 yet, but I'll give you some tips.

First, the narrative is not necessarily straightforward. It kind of bounces around. There's a line you can sort of follow, and a definite end to the book, but be prepared for jumps in the timeline.

Second, the theme of ""craziness"" is important. What does it mean to be ""crazy?"" Is the concept of war crazy? In a way, yes it is.   

Yossarian lives in a tent on a nice Medeterranean island. Every few days, he has to climb into a bomber and fly off to get shot at and drop bombs on people. Is that ""normal?"" Why? 

Have you ever experienced a moment in your life where you suddenly just stopped and wondered ""*Why* am I doing this?""  
I have to get up at a certain time and go to school and wear certain clothes and follow certain rules and study certain subjects and act like it's all important. Is it really? Everybody else seems to go along with it. Am I crazy? Are they?

Yossarian has the same feelings, but his are compounded by the brutal terror of war. People are dying in horrible bloody ways for some reason. Everybody seems to be going along with it. Is this normal?  Is Yossarian crazy for *not* wanting to fly off and get shot at? 

The characters around Yossarian have various personalities. Some seem truly insane, others seem remarkably well-adjusted to the realities of war. Who are the crazy ones? The ones who seem legitimately mad, or the ones who can treat the horror of war as a normal thing?

It's kind of like the mental exercise of trying to explain the rules of life on this planet to a space alien, or to a newborn baby. We have certain customs which we all follow that are probably there for a good reason, but no one can actually explain the importance of. 

Yossarian is in the place of that that newborn baby. It's no accident that (to us) his story opens in a hospital, and his first feeling is love. Outside the walls of the hospital is a terrifying, deadly world that he must try to make sense of, but maybe that world doesn't make sense at all.

How do you live in a crazy world? Do you go crazy yourself to fit in, or do you try to stay sane and have the world call *you* crazy?

3ly0p0_2,3ly0p0,"Here's something I wrote on the Mike Nichols movie a while ago .

>Sorry for the thread crap, but I think Catch-22 is unfilmable. The Mike Nichols Movie proves this for me. It does a great job capturing the atmosphere of claustrophobia and terror, but the humor falls almost completly flat. At first, I wondered why that is, I thought the funny dialogues were already in the book. But now I think the rythm of the dialogues can't be reproduced on film. Much of the humor depends on ""catch"" phrases beeing repeated verbatim, but changing their meaning everytime. Sometimes the same phrases are repeated right back several times in one conversation.

> A reader needs less time each repetition to read the words of the text; he already knows the sentence. He has more time to ponder the changing of tone or meaning. This makes the reading of the dialogues fast and funny. But when said aloud, each repetition takes the same time as before. As the Mike Nichols movie shows, this makes the dialogues extremely slow. The humour loses its rythm, that is to say, the humour is lost. The Nichols movie tried to compensate this by a frantic, overwinded delivery. Needless to say, it doesn't work. So an adaption would have to change what is imo the most important stylistic device of the book to have a chance at being funny.

2cbrjl_1,2cbrjl,"Agreed.  *Fear* was recently republished by NYRB, and while it looks like a good read, nothing about it suggests anything remotely similar to the absurd humor of *Catch-22*.  ",TummyCrunches,2014-08-01T15:57:07Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,1
33urqg_1,33urqg,"I had a weird experience with Catch-22.  The first time I read it, I didn't enjoy the process of reading it at all.  But after I read it, it became my favorite book, even before I read it again.  I usually say don't waste time on books that don't pique your interest, but I think that's one worth finishing.",,2015-04-25T20:56:21Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,1
33urqg_2,33urqg,"I hated Catch-22. But I was 20 when I read it. I'll probably pick it up again.

Once I snuggled in with A Canticle for Leibowitz, because a friend had bought it and wanted me to vet it for him before he started. Anybody who has read that knows...it is MIND-NUMBINGLY BORING. It has no point, no real plot that you can discern, and it is a jumble of stories that seem to have nothing to do with each other and make no sense.

Then the last 5 pages blew my mind and now it is one of my favorite books of all time.

So, you know. Your mileage may vary on Catch-22. For now, I'd say if you're not into it, put it down. But maybe give it another 75 pages and see how you feel.",OvercaffeinateMe,2015-04-25T23:37:04Z,0,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,2
33urqg_3,33urqg,"*Catch-22* plays with language and logic. It requires a familiarity with bureaucracy and Modern themes. This means it won't speak to everyone. If you are getting the vibe, you may not be able to connect to the book. ",byzantinebobby,2015-04-26T03:30:37Z,0,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,3

6skl4g_1,6skl4g,"Catch-22 is one of my favourite books. The story is, indeed, a bit tough to get into, but in my experience it gets better the further you get into the book.",RhymingStuff,2017-08-09T10:34:56Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,1
6skl4g_2,6skl4g,"Catch-22 is truly an amazing book, but I can see how the tempo and jumps in time can be frustrating and at sometimes hard to follow along with. I used to read every chapter as a single little story by itself, makes you appreciate the characters and their humor. But don't worry the chapters will begin to weave into each other the further along in the book you get. Good luck, hope it helps.",The_Unlit_Candle,2017-08-09T13:26:55Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,2
6skl4g_3,6skl4g,The story is told out of order and over and over. Catch-22 is a book about the journey not the story. The narrative technique is unique and purposeful. The tone will slowly change due to the technique. It's brilliant and a book that is difficult the first time around.,11102015-1,2017-08-09T13:27:19Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,3
6skl4g_4,6skl4g,"Halfway through Catch-22 myself. I picked it up because my boyfriend said or was his ultimate favourite fiction book of all times, I think this statement kept me going through the first half of the book, because honestly, I would've put it down after 50 pages or so because it's so hard to follow. 

I'm slowly getting into it now bit yeah, it's so easy to get lost in the plot. In a way, I feel relieved every time I get to a new chapter and can forget about the big picture for a while and enjoy the new story for what it is.

I even considered watching the film to help me put the story together in my head. 
If you're looking for practical tips on helping you get through the book, I think it's the best thing you can do: watch the film and then go on enjoying the style and all the subtleties of the story in the book. 
I'm trying my best stay away from the film until I'm done with the book but it might just be an exceptional case for which it could work better this way.",elenas1992,2017-08-09T14:29:14Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,4

Just yesterday I was thinking about re-re-re(?)-reading this book. If it doesn't work for you now, wait 10 years and try again. Your life experience may not yet be sufficiently absurd and futile.",ElemEtter,2016-04-06T16:30:25Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Catch-22,1
