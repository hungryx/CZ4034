1arcnnv,Question about 'Rebecca',"Okay, I've read this book plenty of times before and enjoyed it, but one early episode just makes me confused because I cannot for the life of me figure out what it means. The bit where the dressmaker offers the protagonist a 10% cut, and the protagonist is embarrassed. I don't get it. I'm bad enough at picking up on social subtext with real people, let alone in print. 

>I told him how I had rung the bell for the lift, and as I had done so she \[dressmaker\] had fumbled in her bag and gave me a note for a hundred francs. ""Here,"" she had whispered, her tone intimate and unpleasant, ""I want you to accept this small commission for bringing your patron to my shop."" When I had refused, scarlet with embarrassment, she had shrugged her shoulders disagreeably. ""Just as you like,"" she had said, ""but I assure you it's quite usual. Perhaps you would rather have a frock. Come along to the shop without Madame and I will fix you up without charging you a sou."" Somehow, I don't know why, I had been aware of that sick, unhealthy feeling I had experienced as a child when turning the pages of a forbidden book. The vision of the constumptive son faded, and in its stead rose the picture of myself had I been different, pocketing that greasy note with an understanding smile, and perhaps slipping round to Blaize's shop on this my free afternoon and coming away with a frock I had not paid for.

tjqgtu,Rebecca - Daphne Du Maurier,"I just wanted to say that I'm halfway through this book and I'm upset that I:

a) somehow hadn't heard of it before now

b) am only reading it for the first time

The way du Maurier strings her sentences together are beautiful. The way she describes each scene with detail without losing the reader is fantastic and the overall sense of unease makes me not want to put the book down.

That's all. I'm not including any spoilers because I haven't yet finished the book,  but if you like Gothic romance thrillers this book is definitely worth picking up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tjqgtu/rebecca_daphne_du_maurier/,2022-03-22T00:33:28Z,82,266,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery
16ouvjx,why the footnotes in Babel by Rebecca F. Kuang,"I have been thinking about the use of the weird and kind of random footnotes in Babel by Rebecca F. Kuang.... EVERYONE speaking about them online find them tiresome and think that they take you out of your reading experience, and I kind of agree... But I still LOVE that they're there.

See the thing is that I've never seen the author using them that much in any other of her books!! So my guess is that she simply is criticising the overuse of barely relevent footnotes in academic paper... 

I mean the whole book is about criticising in many ways the institution of University??? I just don't think she would use that many footnotes just to add some light context for the sake of her worldbuilding, because Rebecca F. Kuang KNOWS how to worldbuild without footnotes (cf the Poppy War trilogy!!) 

I think she's just being the sarcastic PhD student that she is; criticising the not always relevent and frankly boring footnotes you can find everywhere in academic writings, that make the papers reading experience even worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16ouvjx/why_the_footnotes_in_babel_by_rebecca_f_kuang/,2023-09-21T23:27:51Z,46,55,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery
ytbt3j,Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier...WOW lets talk,"Finished re-reading Rebecca, read it 1st when I was 18 and many things went over my head I'd love to discuss. Contains spoilers

‚Ä¢Rebecca loved herself, Maxim loved Mandalay, narrator loved Maxim.

‚Ä¢narrator is the original pickme girl

‚Ä¢Maxim enjoys treating narrator as inferior. The ""proposal"" & the way she squashed her concerned gut feelings was hard to read. As was the exchange between Maxim & Danvers after she broke the ornament, threatening to leave her in the middle of nowhere in Monte Carlo, all their ""disputes"". It's clear to us there's no reciprocal love or respect. 

‚Ä¢Maxim cultivated balance of power in his favour. Not buying her appropriate clothes before arrival at Mandalay, not warning her about Danvers, he kept setting her up to fail.

‚Ä¢Maxim is an incel

‚Ä¢narrator & Frank fell for each other. I couldn't stop focusing on this while reading. They enjoy each others company, laugh, she talks to him freely, they share same social background. Frank is who helps her navigate social situations, he always makes sure she's eaten, when Favell confronts them Frank goes to stand behind her chair, a gesture of unity you'd expect from a husband. 

‚Ä¢Maxims confession is blatant BS. Danvers shares Maxim was besotted with Rebecca in the early days. Danvers knows Rebecca was unfaithful, why would she lie? Narrator observes Maxim having deep emotion while smelling the azaleas in Happy Valley, azaleas Rebecca brought to Mandalay. Maxim claims Beatrice hated Rebecca. Beatrice seemed genuinely concerned about the suicide verdict, not just for Maxim reputation. His description of Rebecca fleeing to London after fulfilling social engagements and slowly integrating her friends into Mandalay sounds like a women in a controlling marriage holding onto a level of freedom. Not a master manipulator. Especially as he chooses a young, na√Øve friendless orphan for his 2nd marriage.

‚Ä¢Rebecca is gay üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

‚Ä¢Beatrice fancied Rebecca üåà

‚Ä¢Rebecca and Favell were alleged cousin-fuckers

‚Ä¢Rebecca is an ""imperfect victim"". It's easy to believe Maxim's POV because she terrorises the disabled man, she abuses her childhood horse, she's bisexual, she's unfaithful. She also has all the traits women are demonised for possessing in a misogynistic society. Fearless, too confident, independent, too perfect, not only aware of her beauty but using it to her advantage. There's a parallel to be drawn in the way these characters tear apart Rebecca and the way our society tore apart Amber Heard. 


‚Ä¢Yes Rebecca became ill. But it's telling the amount of characters who comment Rebecca was always too slim and start making the same observation about the 2nd wife. It read that Max sucked the life out of his wives with his emotional abuse. The weekend Maxim leaves her alone the narrator notes she feels lighter & happier and then corrects herself.

‚Ä¢Maxim withheld affection until after his confession. Then he immediately lovebombs her to secure her blind devotion. Her circumstances leave her with no other option. Calculated. 

‚Ä¢The book makes it clear their physical relationship begins with the confession & ends with Mandalay. Why does the film version with Emilia Fox & Charles Dance portray their relationship as sexually active from marriage? I believe the Netflix version also does this, I'm interested why.

‚Ä¢Maxim planned to murder Rebecca despite his claims the reverse is true. No one in the household knew Maxim had returned from dinner with Frank, who is as loyal to Maxim as Danny is to Rebecca (*perfect alibi*), Danvers was away, (*a rarity*) & he took a gun with him to confront Rebecca believing Favell was with her. The only flaw in his plan was underestimating how poor his sailing abilities were from lack of practice. Maxim is clear he considered murdering Rebecca in Monte Carlo, believing the unstable terrain would provide a natural alibi. Calculated.

‚Ä¢*'I'd forgotten that when you shot a person there was so much blood.'* How many other people did you murder Maxim de Winter? 

‚Ä¢That abrupt ending was a mindfuck. The reading equivalent of a mic drop",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ytbt3j/rebecca_by_daphne_du_maurierwow_lets_talk/,2022-11-12T16:33:28Z,61,139,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery
18dgk3m,Rebecca - ben,"I took a breather from my usual stephen king / genre reading to listen to the excellent narration of Rebecca, far from my usual type of story. (Actually, king recommends it frequently.) It was slow paced yet so well written I enjoyed getting absorbed in it almost like comfort food. I expected a thriller, which it was not, though I enjoyed most of it. I do agree with the general consensus that the ending is lack luster - regardless how you feel about the characters' fates, it was all anticlimactic at the very end.

My biggest gripe however and I don't seem to see enough discussion about is the character of Ben. What a blatant abuse of the chekov's gun rule. Ben was the smoking gun the whole time and what a brilliant twist it was to bring him in and have him blow the case open. To have him cover it up also, presumably under Frank's orders, and then slink away rendered the character completely useless. What a letdown. If you completely remove Ben from the story, absolutely nothing would change. And for a character with so much literary promise it really bugs me.

Any thoughts on Ben to redeem his justification to exist in the story?

Rebecca generously earns 3 out 5 stars overall from me mostly on the strength of its writing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18dgk3m/rebecca_ben/,2023-12-08T06:21:21Z,3,0,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery
190bma9,The Last Letter by Rebecca Yarros ‚Äì anyone else shed tears reading it? Thoughts?,"I've just finished reading the book and, honestly, it was such a rollercoaster of emotions that I just had to get my thoughts into words. I have mixed feelings reading this throughout this book (I'll censor out any major spoilers even though I've tagged on the flair).

1. **Do you think there is such a thing as too much tragedy in a book** i.e. multiple tragedies that strike the same person over and over again? I know that in reality, there are people who suffer from multiple tragedies. I suppose with this book, about the last 10% of the ending was so shocking and out of the blue. Ella has had so many deaths in her family, >!her daughter's illness, and then she lost her little boy too!<? Just as things were getting good in her life. It was so very sudden and felt rushed at the end. From that point it just felt like I finished the book simply because there were a few more pages (I loved the epilogue though ‚Äì nice touch from Maisie). I feel more heartbroken at the fact that >!Maisie lost her other half as the twin bond is something so special and unique!<.
2. **Do you think Beckett's lies (although he was aware of it) were justified?** I understand how much Beckett's trauma, guilt and grief made him want to hide the truth from Ella. I don't know if I'm biased regarding this because I have severe trust issues from people lying in my past, so I couldn't see Beckett's motivations as justified by any measure. It seemed to me that he wanted to keep the promise to Ryan more than not hurting Ella (and the kids by extension). I know he viewed Ryan as a brother. If he told Ella the truth at the beginning ‚Äì and revealed his identity ‚Äì and Ella does indeed push him away as he assumed, I think that is a much more forgivable mistake than lying for almost a whole year. Being ghosted is just horrible and >!the fact that Ella never knew what happened to Chaos must have hurt a lot worse!<.
3. **What do you think of Ella's character?** Overall, I think she was an okay character. I just feel that some parts didn't really make sense. At the part when she was >!content with her relationship with Beckett!<, she mentioned that she was aware of the shadows of his past that she was not privy too. She was aware of the fact that he knew more about her and she didn't know large chunks of him/ his past (I'd consider this a red flag; even if it is not malicious intent, I'd still be somewhat wary). She accepted it and was content with how things were. But when she found out the truth of who he really was (>!after seeing the letters Beckett showed her), she cut him out of her life immediately and her kids' lives too, making them feel unloved!<. I understand how hurt she must have felt but I would have assumed she knew this when she accepted him, and let him into her life *and* her kids lives. Would it have made more sense for her to exercise caution and still have some boundaries although remaining fairly close (like being just friends)? I'm just thinking with the kids' emotions in the mix, it complicates the situation so much more.
4. Maisie's/Margaret's name ‚Äì random question but at the beginning when the name Margaret was used, Maisie corrected it saying it is ""Maisie"". Throughout the book a few times Margaret was used but it was not corrected. I figured maybe it was her actual name but they just call her Maisie instead, but I don't think I came across any explanation for this. I just wondered since the names were used interchangeably in the book at times.

pzmiwt,"I couldn't put down Rebecca, but ended up disappointed. SPOILERS","I couldn't put this book down, but I ended up being disappointed. Not necessarily because of the ending, but because of a lack of character development. 
The protagonist stays painstakingly shy and self conscious for a very long time, to the point of becoming annoying. When she does gain confidence, it's to be harsh with the servants. 
She remains incredibly devoted to Maxim without him giving her much reason to. No deep friendship or swoon-worthy moments between them.
Yes, I understand that Rebecca was a cruel liar and adulteress, but does that really give someone the right to murder her? I wasn't convinced. Sure, it's a crime of passion, but I wasn't moved to feel much sympathy for Maxim. He even said he feels no remorse and would do it again.
I expected more to happen. More development in the characters and their relationships. It just fell flat for me after all that reading. I also wanted ghostly or spooky moments and they never came.

17i6xl0,"Unpacking 'Fourth Wing' by Rebecca Yarros: A World of Magic, Dragons, and... Dilemmas?","So, I recently got my hands on ""Fourth Wing"" by Rebecca Yarros, and boy, was it a ride. Right from the get-go, we're thrown into this intriguing premise: Violet Sorrengail, gearing up to enter a school that's not just any school. Think factions, think magic, and yes, think dragons. The catch? She's aiming to be a dragon rider. 

Sounds cool, right?But here's where things get spicy. Enter Xaden Riorson. Not your run-of-the-mill bad boy, but a leader with looks that could kill (quite literally). And Violet? She's smitten, even when it seems like he might be the death of her. Their dynamic? It's... complicated. And while I'm all for a good romance, the detailed account of their, let's say, ""intimate moments"" felt a tad overboard for me.

Speaking of characters, there's Dain. Childhood friend, but with a weird sense of entitlement. Like, boundaries, dude. But the story doesn't stop at character dynamics. We've got dark wizards, epic battles, and plot twists that make you go, ""Wait, what?""

By the end, I was left with mixed feelings. The world Yarros paints is fascinating, but there are elements that made me raise an eyebrow. For those who've ventured into this world, what's your take?

11en4wi,Why is Rebecca Solnit so underrated?,"Just wanted to share my enthusiasm for one of my most recent discoveries: Rebecca Solnit's works. And by underrated I mean that I never heard her name and it was by pure accident that I found this hidden gem.

I was dusting my book shelves when a title caught my eye: Recollections of my Nonexistence. I put the book aside, thinking I might give it a try the coming days. Boy! Was I in for a treat! I can't recall the last time I was so engrossed with a book, maybe when I discovered Siri Hustvedt?

Words are lifeless and still so powerful, it's amazing what a skilled person can do with them. Solnit has such an unique way with words, I love her poetical language, the nostalgia that feels almost material under her pen, the thought provoking questions she's posing, the simple, yet so full of substance analogies that she makes, oftentimes I felt like she defines the indefinable or writes about things that crossed your mind, but you never thought could take the shape of words.

My edition is in German and since I ached to read it in original language, I ordered the English version and Orwell's Roses in addition to it. :) I can barely wait!

Just wanted to hear if there are any other Solnit fans in here and if you read her other books as well. Would love to hear your opinion!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11en4wi/why_is_rebecca_solnit_so_underrated/,2023-02-28T23:11:32Z,12,59,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery
143ddc6,does anyone know what's going on with fourth wing by rebecca yarros?,"the book is the [first in a new fantasy series by rebecca yarros](https://www.rebeccayarros.com/books/fourth-wing/) and was released either april 5th or may 2nd ([I think may 2nd is correct](https://www.entangledpublishing.com/books/fourth-wing) but google sometimes reports the april date?). fourth wing is currently out of stock at every barnes and noble and walmart in my area, and checked out or on hold at every available library in two library networks near where I live, AND it is backordered on both amazon and bookshop dot org.

my question is: what's happening? is this just because it blew up on tiktok pretty suddenly or is there a publishing issue? or both?! the second in the series supposedly comes out on november 7th -- is the quick turnaround from first release to second contributing to the high demand? does this normally happen to new releases and I've just never noticed?

I'm not that worried about getting it myself I just don't think I've seen a new release blow up so quickly like this? I would love to hear your thoughts!

16at4ke,"Divine Rivals by Rebecca Ross: Another Booktok disappointment, an elaborate breakdown","After seeing high praise about this book everywhere, I was so sure I'd like it. I'm generally wary of booktok recommendations but Hannah (the clockwork reader) recommended it and my taste usually coincides with hers. Plus there was so much praise here on Reddit too. I do not know what it is with popular romance books being extremely mid but here we go (some of the notes are from my direct annotations at the time of reading:

&#x200B;

>‚ÄúThen who are you?‚Äù she whispered, hands fisted deep in her pockets. She slowly came to a halt in the street.‚Äù

One of my biggest grievances, the writing in this book sounds very akin to my Wattpad book I published years ago as a fangirl. I do not know if it's just because I used to write like this but it makes me not want to take the book seriously.

>‚ÄúI guess what I meant to say was¬†‚Ä¶ is this what you envisioned for yourself, Prindle? When you were a girl and anything seemed possible?‚Äù

I might be nitpicking here but they are literal teenagers, why would she call her work friend by her last name? I understand referring to the ML that way but with friends it sounds so weird it made me want to roll my eyes.

>‚Äúhis teeth clinking shut ‚Äù

um???

>‚Äú a hiss as if she had burned him‚Äù

we are literally just 30 pages in

>‚ÄúDo you make it a habit to read other people‚Äôs post?‚Äù

not the try-hard wannabe sassy girl dialogue üò≠

>‚Äúher exquisite, visceral writing style ‚Äù

lol. it couldn't be more basic if she tried.

>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nineteen,‚Äù she guessed. ‚ÄúBut you have an old soul, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

STOP üíÄ (i laughed out loud when i read this)

>‚ÄúShe straightened and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.‚Äù

again nitpicking but this is not a screenplay.

>‚ÄúElinor‚Äôs sharp gaze almost cut through him when she glanced up.‚Äù

classic Wattpad writing

>‚ÄúDamn, he was proud of her.‚Äù

uh...

>‚ÄúI recognize the same gleam in you that dwells in me‚Äù

said no one ever.

>‚ÄúHer hands went cold. She couldn‚Äôt move as the seconds continued to pass and she realized he was this close to her and yet so far away, walking in a field. His ignorance was going to draw a bomb. He was destined to be blown apart and killed, and Iris tried to envision what her life would be like with him dead.‚Äù

she barely knows him. he is literally just a *former* work colleague

>‚ÄúIt is, so long as we don‚Äôt expire from hunger waiting for you every sunrise,‚Äù Iris quipped, and she thought she saw a smile tease his lips, but perhaps she imagined it.‚Äù

This book tries hard to fit into the traditional structure of yearning and pining but does it so damn poorly.

>‚ÄúShe really didn‚Äôt want to exercise with Roman. But the more she remembered the sight of him returning from his run‚Äîall vigor and fire, as if he had drunk from the sky, untamed and unburdened and alive‚Äîthe more she wanted to feel that herself.‚Äù

it didn't have to be that dramatic. i see the Madeline Miller writing style attempt but did it really have to be about...exercise?

>‚ÄúHe looked younger, she thought.‚Äù

he is literally 18.

>‚ÄúWould you like to go on a walk with me?‚Äù

she asks, knowing that this had shrapnel pierced into his leg on account of saving her from dying. now isn't she our little genius? ü•∞

>‚Äúyou have my approval, a hundred times over.‚Äù

now why would Roman actively seek Iris' friend's approval to marry Iris? I get that this is a light fantasy novel but there's zero explanation for this.

>‚Äú ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go back there, sister.‚Äù

who ever addresses their sister as 'sister'?

&#x200B;

Here are some other things I had issues with:

1. I don't get how Iris is not absolutely furious about Roman choosing to act like an anonymous penpal. idk that shit seems straight up manipulative and weird. If it were me, I'd feel disrespected and fooled but she is just forgiving I guess.
2. The fantasy element was so in-immersive. I could not care about Forest, her mother, the gods, the war or anything else. The only character that had any dimension was Iris and her dimension was being unlikeable in a weird way in that her character is written to be likeable without any solid reasoning as to why. No nuance.
3. There was so much fluff in this book which could be straight up edited out. I do not care about Iris' past memory of her mother waiting tables. I could not care less about Roman's forced marriage shit, it was so unnecessary. The part about the Sycamore platoon could have been nice if it was RELEVANT. It was added just for tragedy's sake. The weirdly flowery language just added to the irrelevance of the length of the book despite not being particularly lengthy.

To conclude, here is some writing that I actually enjoyed:

>‚Äúyou let the light stream in, even if it makes you wince.‚Äù  
>  
>‚Äúyet he didn‚Äôt move, just as she had ordered.""  
>  
>‚ÄúWe woke up this morning to one world, and now the sun is setting on another.‚Äù

So that was Divine Rivals, another insufferable booktok recommendation.

14psf1n,Does Rebecca Ross end all her books like that?,"Spoilers for Divine Rivals!

Just finished this book last night and I was enthralled by her prose and unusually interested in this unique blend of mythology, fantasy, and historical/war commentary. Her exploration of grief, love, competition, and war was extremely insightful. Each character felt alive and very much grounded in their own wisdom. 

That said, the ending was atrocious. I completely checked out when Forest showed up but even before that the pacing felt off (the flirting and war wounds and marriage all made sense but... Wasn't she there to find her brother? A few sentences after the fact where she dully says she doesn't deserve happiness doesn't make forgetting about her whole purpose for being at the war front due to a hot man make sense, like shouldn't that conversation have been more introspective and come way sooner? I get how much a headstrong character can get distracted by seeing someone she knows almost being killed but to get distracted by him simply being in the same house?) Furthermore the epilogue with Dacre... We all know Roman was getting the same treatment as Forest why did Ross suddenly change pov to a character we barely know anything about? It maybe built some hype that we would see more about enva and Dacre from their own perspective in the second book but in all actuality it opened way too many doors. If she had ended this book around the marriage she would have left it at a satisfying conclusion to the main plot (how Iris and Roman are gonna end up) while leaving a great hook for book two (forest is still not around, there is still a war-how is this new couple going to make it through that). Furthermore if she had started book two with Dacres pov I know I would have read it in one sitting-for real that is such a cool change of pace but it feels ruined because it's basically the beginning of a new plot at the end of a 300 page novel.

In short... I really enjoyed Rebecca's writing but I need some sort of hope that this is not common for her before I pick up another of her books.

14vn6z1,little altars everywhere by rebecca wells discussion: is siddalee gay?,"title says it all, is siddalee gay?
read the book, adored it, but was extremely confused at the lack of acknowledgment or resolution to what I thought was an important part of siddalees character. I thought that the girl with a severe obsession with being holy yet so much in her life being unholy was a perfect premise for a gay character, and chapter 2: choreography (where she details her crush on her dance teacher and kisses her best friend) essentially solidified that for me. along with other quotes (like on pg 81, where sidda says she loves liz taylors breasts) made it seem like she was written to be a lesbian. however, after that there is no more acknowledgment of it, and the last we see of siddalee (as an adult) the only thing she mentions sexuality wise is that she has chemistry with her male friend, Connor. i was rlly surprised by this and searched up whether or not she was gay, but no one anywhere talks about it. does anyone have an answer?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14vn6z1/little_altars_everywhere_by_rebecca_wells/,2023-07-10T07:43:35Z,9,7,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery
nw3jwg,Rebecca is such a hauntingly beautiful novel.,"Im only on chapter 4 and I feel what could only be described as this haunting and beautiful atmosphere. It looms over me just as Rebecca's shadow will loom over the protagonist (I watched the Hitchcock film so I know what happens). The first chapter does a great job of engendering this haunting atmosphere and overall just screams _GOTHIC_. The following chapters do not lose this ambience. 

I just finished the fourth chapter and would like to share with you a  passage that I found interesting: 

""'Max - from Rebecca. 17 May',....And then as it bubbled through the nib, it came a little thick, so that the name Rebecca stood out black and strong, the tall and sloping R dwarfing the other letters."" 

It is interesting that the protagonist would think this considering the events that will follow. Because just as the letter R dwarfs the other letters, Rebecca will dwarf the protagonist. And how Rebecca will stand 'black and strong' in spite of her not being around will contrast the main character's meekness. 
 I picked up that the protagonist is unnamed (I dont remember if the film did the same but I think it did). What is even more interesting is the title of the book: Rebecca. So readers will come out of this novel knowing Rebecca's name while not being privy to the protagonist's despite her being, well the protagonist.  


 What do you guys think of the novel?

Also if you want to read the book with me, just shoot me a dm and we can like discuss the book together as we read it.

123up3k,One Italian Summer: A Novel Book by Rebecca Serle,"Hey here is my review of one of my favorite books. Do read it 

Rebecca Serle's One Italian Summer is a heartwarming and engaging novel about love, family, and self-discovery. The narrative follows three generations of women as they travel to Italy to attend a family wedding.

Gia, the protagonist, is still reeling from a recent breakup and is hesitant to accompany her mother and grandmother on their trip. However, as she travels through Italy's beautiful countryside and reconnects with her family, she begins to rediscover herself and opens herself up to the possibility of new love.
Serle's writing is lovely and vivid, evoking images of the Italian countryside and its rich cultural heritage. The food, architecture, and people are all described in such vivid detail that readers will feel as if they are right there with the characters.

Characters are also well-drawn and realistic, with recognisable flaws and struggles. Gia, in particular, is a likeable and relatable protagonist whose self-discovery journey is both inspiring and heartwarming.
The book's exploration of family dynamics and relationships is one of its strongest points. Serle does an excellent job of portraying the complexities of Gia's relationships with her mother and grandmother.

Overall, One Italian Summer is a charming and uplifting novel that will transport readers to Italy's beautiful countryside and leave them inspired and uplifted. Serle's writing is both evocative and engaging, with relatable and well-drawn characters. If you're looking for a lighthearted summer read that will make you smile, this is the book for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/123up3k/one_italian_summer_a_novel_book_by_rebecca_serle/,2023-03-27T17:52:39Z,4,10,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery

Feel free to discuss the book in the comments on this post.  

Even if you do not often read non fiction I highly recommend this book.  

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks):

>Henrietta Lacks, as HeLa, is known to present-day scientists for her cells from cervical cancer. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells were taken without her knowledge and still live decades after her death. Cells descended from her may weigh more than 50M metric tons. 

>HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb‚Äôs effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks was buried in an unmarked grave.

>The journey starts in the ‚Äúcolored‚Äù ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s, her small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia ‚Äî wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo. Today are stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells, East Baltimore children and grandchildren live in obscurity, see no profits, and feel violated.

rpee8s,Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier was a disappointment,"Rebecca is widely considered a classic, and I can see how at the time it was published it became popular, but I don't understand its staying power. People had hyped this book up to me, about how it was so \~mysterious\~ and \~romantic\~ and \~gothic\~ but it ranged from boring to frustration. A quick rundown of my problems with it:

* The main character not having a name. I understand how it could be a good literary use, but the de Winters come out on top, ultimately. It is seen as a good thing that the main character focuses her life on her husband, rather than something that leads to her downfall.
* I suppose if you like descriptions, this could be an interesting book. But I found it completely dull until Maxim comes out with the fact that he murdered Rebecca. Their courtship wasn't particularly interesting. We could have gotten the point that everyone loved Rebecca and an intro to the important characters in a much shorter amount of time rather than the 250 pages it took. And there's not too much set up for the mystery, other than Ben and his statements about Rebecca's final night. Mrs. Danvers was a bit unsettling, but she's rarely in it and we never got enough of an amp-up to her being a danger (imo). It's like DuMaurier was writing about her own frustrations/insecurities first and then added a little bit of the murder element.
* Maxim murdered his wife. I know it was a different time and all of that, but he MURDERED his WIFE. She was an adulterer and mean and stuff, but he killed her and supposedly we're supposed to hope he gets away with it? And the fact that Rebecca knew she could wind him up to kill her is TERRIFYING. 
* The main character only becomes empowered AFTER HER HUSBAND CONFESSES HE MURDERED REBECCA. WTF. It was so quick and sudden and reeked of her insecurity I hated this is how she became confidant. So she can only be self-assured if the first wife was so wretched and heinous that her husband was compelled to kill her?! 
* I'm not usually one to cheer for the coded villains, but I was rooting for Rebecca after all of this came out. I hoped Maxim would be arrested and found guilty.
* I think all of this also bugged me because as I read the novel, we're supposed to root for Maxim and his second wife and the work doesn't seem aware of their flaws at all. I know some people hate Rochester from Jane Eyre, but the work is at least aware of what he's done wrong and gives him a bit of redemption/punishment for it; or Wuthering Heights fully admits Catherine and Heathcliffe's shortcomings and again, they both end up dying for it. Manderley might have burnt down, but it doesn't feel like enough for me. 

I guess I liked Beatrice but that was it. I also understand that Daphne DuMaurier had married a widower and was insecure about the fact that his first wife was supposedly the love of his life, so I guess it just makes me sad that this is how she had to cope with all of this instead of finding her own self-confidence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rpee8s/rebecca_by_daphne_dumaurier_was_a_disappointment/,2021-12-27T04:14:13Z,24,9,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery
kl82uo,Rebecca (by Daphne du Maurier) Ending.,"I just finished Rebecca and I enjoyed the book a lot. The plot was captivating from start to finish, and the suspense had my toes curled throughout.

However, I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about the ending. I can‚Äôt decide if it was underwhelming after the massive build-up, or a clever way for us to infer what happens next in our own accord. 

The novel starts with the pair in France and her dreaming of Manderly which is now abandoned. Towards the ending, the colonel suggests they get away for a while to another country before returning to Manderly. On their way to Manderly they see red in the sky which I‚Äôm assuming is a fire. Is Manderly therefore destroyed (if so, by who? Favel? Mrs Danvers? ‚Äî Favel does say he will get Max one way or another) and so they had no choice but to leave. It mentions at the start, ‚Äòwe can never go back,‚Äô and describes Maxim as rather haunted.

Edit: Do you feel sorry for Maxim? For the narrator too? Or do you think Maxim deserved what happened?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kl82uo/rebecca_by_daphne_du_maurier_ending/,2020-12-27T18:01:05Z,24,43,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery
ipwcaw,"Rebecca, anxiety, and being seen by a book.","I recently finished reading Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier, which I loved overall. The one thing that struck me the most though was the way the author describes the main character's anxiety. She (we never learn her actual name) is pretty consistently written with this aspect of her personality either just below the surface as an internal monologue, or sometimes blatantly on display. Specifically, a couple sections really spoke to me and my own struggles with anxiety. 

There's a bit where the main character is worried about her husband because he's been away for a while, and she spirals down this thought process of ""what if he got in car accident"". She's completely at the mercy of her imagination, and I can't count how many times I've been in that exact same mindset in my life. I'd consider my own anxiety relatively mild, but I've still walked myself to the edge of a panic attack when a loved one seems like they've been gone just a little too long. 

Another section involves the MC worrying that her husband >!will be hanged, and she rambles on about how she's heard that hanged people don't always die right away.!< It's written in a way where you can tell she's losing her grip, how she can't really get away from the thought. She then attempts to think about something, anything, else. She imagines her former employer and what her life might be like, but the attempt is futile and eventually leads right back to that crippling thought. This was another all too familiar experience for me. I've made that desperate attempt to get my mind on something else, only to have it fail miserably. 

This all led me to think about how special it is when you feel ""seen"" by a book, and how a book can maybe do this better than any other medium. Instead of this story sending me into a panic attack, it more often than not made me feel a little less isolated in my anxiety. 

Seeing yourself in a book is something often talked about as an important experience for young readers, but I didn't expect it to still happen to me as an adult that has been reading for most of their life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ipwcaw/rebecca_anxiety_and_being_seen_by_a_book/,2020-09-10T04:18:31Z,26,77,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery
ngubp3,Let's talk about Black Sun by Rebecca Roanhorse,">""A single Obregi man,"" he said lightly. ""Blinded. Scarred. Some kind of religious affliction, as I understand it. Harmless."" The last he said too quickly, as if he was hiding something. ""Usually,"" Xiala said carefully, ""when someone describes a man as harmless, he ends up being a villain.""

In the holy city of Tova, the Sun Priest prepares for the coming winter solstice while dealing with political intrigue and disgruntlement from both the city and the tower. Furthermore, this year the winter solstice will coincide with a solar eclipse, a rare celestial event that could harbor the unbalancing of the world. Meanwhile, a disgraced Teek captain, Xiala, sets sail from Cuecola with a mysterious passenger that needs to be in Tova on the winter solstice. Will Xiala be able to calm the sea enough to get him there on time?

It has been a while since I've read a book that both made me want to hurry to the end because I wanted to know what happened and slow down because I didn't want it to end. I really enjoyed Roanhorse's writing. She did some wonderful things with several time jumps, especially at the start of the book. Some of the jumps forward gave me the sense that I could predict what would happen, but nothing quite happened in the way I expected it would. It was very cleverly done.

>""All stories are lies."" She exhaled dramatically. ""You have a lot to learn for some crow grandpa."" He wanted to tell her she was wrong. All stories were true, in their own way.

The story is set in world that is inspired by pre-Columbian Americas and Roanhorse does a wonderful job introducing the world she has created. I don't remember any info dumps and I felt she worked the introduction of the world in to the narrative very smoothly. In some cases I would have wanted to know more, because Roanhorse hints at some interesting aspects of certain societies, but they weren't entirely relevant to the story. Hopefully the later parts in the series will broach those societies a bit more. No doubt I missed some of the significance of certain choices Roanhorse made for her world, but that wasn't a detriment to my enjoyment of the book. I suspect that getting all the significance would have added another enjoyable level to the book, but at no point did I feel I was missing out.

The book is told from four different POVs. Different POVs can be badly done or feel unnecessary, but in this case I think it fit the story and actually added to the story. One of the things that I like about multiple POVs, if done well, is that the author can make the reader sympathize with several characters even if they are on opposite sides of events or ideas. Roanhorse did this successfully in my opinion. Furthermore, all four of the voices felt distinct, compelling and they all brought something unique to the story. Seeing the events unfold from several perspectives made it feel like an inevitable convergence of the characters.

I generally enjoy books that I read, but this one really stood out. I'm definitely looking forward to the second part, which unfortunately will not be out for a while. I still recommend checking this book out, because it is definitely worth it in my opinion.

k6thrd,I just finished Rebecca and would love to discuss it!,"I would give it 4/5 stars. 

I read it because of recommendations saying it was the best psychological thriller of all time. I don‚Äôt agree with that, but I found other things to love!

I thought it was written very well. Daphne du Maurier paints scenes vividly, both externally and internally. She does a great job describing Manderley, as well as what is happening in the mind of our heroine. 

The book is sort of creepy, but I was expecting more spookiness. There are a few moments that were chilling though, particularly when Mrs Danvers went off on her recollections of Rebecca. 

I had read people say things like ‚Äúthere are seven mind blowing twists!‚Äù. I was a bit disappointed in that regard. There was one incredible twist, and it reframed the whole novel. But it wasn‚Äôt mind blowing. 

That being said I found the last ~150 pages to be thrilling, with some twists that kept my attention. 

Even without the twists, it was an engrossing story, and made me feel quite a bit for the unnamed heroine. Nevertheless I did feel the first 2/3 of the novel dragged.

me3qab,Black Sun by Rebecca Roanhorse,"I needed a fantasy break from medieval Europe inspired stories and when I heard of a Mayan and Aztec fantasy story I checked it out asap. The premise is interesting; a race against time to some something before a solar eclipse? I'm so in.

Sadly the ideas were more interesting than the story. The writing was the biggest issue. Exposition in the form of info dumps was thrown in rather than weaved into the narrative. 

The dialogue was not so good. Besides the info dumps, characters don't really have a distinguished voice, except snarky comments. 

Speaking of the characters we get told too much who they are rather than shown. The badass captain and sailor is introduced in a jail cell. Rather than see what happens we are told she fought someone, and then we are told how she survived in the past, and then we are told- stop it! I wanna see it in real time not be told what she's done.

There's characters who don't use pronouns which really gets annoying at first becuase one character is talking then we get this ""Xe said"" and I was like who the hell is Xe?

10e20ws,"""Corinne"" by Rebecca Morrow and ""Get a Life, Chloe Brown"" by Talia Hibbert: review from a romance ""hater""","I've never been a romance guy, but last year, I read *Bridges of Madison County*. That was the first romance I had ever tried, and I enjoyed it! Then in December, I read *Corinne* by Rebecca Morrow. Corinne was so unbelievably good, I finally decided to really give romance a try.

(EDIT: the reason I'm reviewing these two is because they're the two best romances I've read in the last couple months. To be clear, I enjoyed both books. Anyway, back to the review.)

As I've been reading more romance, I've realized how rare it is for a romance to check all three of these boxes:

- it's written in a ""literary fiction"" style. Maybe I have good taste, maybe I'm a snob, either way, I want my romance to read like a ""normal"" book.

- the stakes feel real. I want there to be compelling character motivations behind all the big relationship plot beats.

- the sex is hot. Listen, I'm all for pretentious writing, but sometimes I just want to gasp, and flush, and grab my chest.

*Corinne* checked all three boxes! Absolutely amazing book, I hope everyone who's looking for something like this checks it out. >!Enoch is a believer in the church that Corinne was excommunicated from.!< what a cool premise. People speculate that it was written by (Mormon(?) author) Stephanie Meyer under a pen name, and I think it's possible. As an ex-Mormon twilight fan, it definitely resonated with me. :)

*Get A Life Chloe Brown* unfortunately only checks the last box. I thought the main character (Chloe) was very charming, >!she has fibromyalgia, funny sisters, and an against-the-rules-cat!<, but I thought the male love interest was a boring blob, and the major plot beats seemed to all come from misunderstandings. (>!He thinks she's mean because she's rich, he thinks she is embarrassed by him so they break up, !< etc.) THAT BEING SAID, the sex is great. Talia Hibbert is the first woman romance novelist I've read who really understands how it feels to have a dick.

Overall ""score"" for Corinne: 5/5 stars, it rocked, it checked all my boxes.

Overall ""score"" for Get A Life Chloe Brown: 3/5 stars. Chloe was charming, the romance was fun, and the sex was great. However, the writing wasn't what I was looking for, and the stakes didn't feel very real.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10e20ws/corinne_by_rebecca_morrow_and_get_a_life_chloe/,2023-01-17T03:51:05Z,6,8,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery
v41i7b,Does anyone know what happened to Rebecca Lee? (Bobcat and Other Stories),"Not hopeful for any info but figured I'd ask. 

Bobcat & Other Stories by Rebecca Lee is one of my favorite works of fiction, especially ""Fialta."" Gorgeous prose. Basically every story in the collection was published in a prestigious lit mag, including The New Yorker, and the collection was well reviewed.

However, the stories were published from 1992 to 2000, with a couple closer to the book's release in 2012. Since then, nothing (should note she put out a short novel in 2006).

She's a creative writing teacher at UNC Wilmington, so it's not like she's completely given up the craft. Is it possible she's been working on a book for over 10 years now..?

jgxl7f,Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier - feminist heroine or manipulative villain?,"Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier - hero or villain?

Sorry if this has been raised before but I‚Äôve been wondering what other people‚Äôs views on this are. So Rebecca is definitely portrayed as a villain in the novel (I feel), but how do you view her? 

On one hand, yes, she ‚Äòtricked‚Äô Maxim into marrying her, cheated on him and ruined his chances of happiness through her exploitation of him. However, on the other hand, she took control of her life at a time when it was difficult for a woman to do so and actually lived her life exactly as she wanted. It could be argued that it would have been difficult for her to amass wealth and status on her own during that time because of her sex, and therefore she was forced, by her circumstance, to marry into money if she wanted to secure her place in society. You could argue she played the game to ensure her own security and proceeded to be her true self afterwards. She refused to be truly tied down to any man, which is admirable, and I think her relationship with Mrs Danvers is more than slightly suggestive. Perhaps her only crime was to refuse to be controlled by all the men in her life? The difference between her and the protagonist is that the protagonist chose to be good but was ultimately controlled by all the men in her life; she is so invisible we don‚Äôt even know her name. But Rebecca‚Äôs name was everywhere. She had so much control she exercised it even from beyond the grave. Perhaps as woman, she had too much control for those around her to bear?

nw3jn4,Confused with an aspect of Rebecca - Daphne de Maurier (+ my thoughts on it),"I recently read Rebecca and it's the fastest I've read a book in so long. I found it extremely captivating. 

One element I couldn't wrap my head around was Maxim's behaviour towards our protagonist. I'm convinced this is lack of comprehension on my side, but I really can't understand why he chose to be so distant and almost more like a school teacher who picked her for extra classes than a husband. Our protagonist is constantly harassed by her assumptions, and her false idea of Maxim's expectations is what seems to be the problem. But I don't get why things change for Maxim when he confesses/why their interactions suddenly change? If they hadn't found Rebecca's body, how did he think things were gonna continue? Was he okay being a distant, authority-like figure with no intimacy and a clearly troubled and uncomfortable wife? 

I never liked his character (don't think it's meant to be liked either lol), and the end kinda keeps me hanging and confused as to what his goals were. I concluded that the protagonist's reaction and the fact that she stuck with him made him realise they were in this together? Of course it made HIM closer to her because it erased all doubt of his seeming infatuation with Rebecca... But what explains his behaviour before? What was he unsure of? 



As for my uncalled for thoughts on it, what stood out was how well defined the atmosphere was all throughout the book. That's what kept me hooked, reading this strange sense of discomfort and horror slowly enfold. The protagonist (who I love that we aren't told the name of, I thought it added to how she was unsure of her identity throughout and hadn't found herself). 

Her alienation in the house was so so well written. As a 15 year old very awkward in social situations person, that especially struck a chord with me lmao, I did feel that enormous discomfort of being watched, not knowing how to behave, and the fact that she's burdened with this in her own house adds such a powerful effect. 

Although sometimes her behaviour is very frustrating, I overall felt very close to the narrator and loved the way the story unfolded. The pacing felt just right. It may not suit everyone's taste (it was described as kind of the equivalent of chick-lit when it first came out), I enjoyed the writing, descriptions, detailed atmosphere and the story. I skimmed through it very quick.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nw3jn4/confused_with_an_aspect_of_rebecca_daphne_de/,2021-06-09T19:02:40Z,19,20,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery

I do have some criticisms, my main one being Nita and Kovit won too easily. Especially Nita's fight against her mom, that fight was hyped up for most of the series for the actual ""fight"" to last one page (technically a chapter). And to me it just seems out of character for her mom to not expect a bomb and for her to die just like that. But there was a lot I loved too, I liked that Nita and Kovit knew they were evil and that they were never going to be good, I feel there's a lot times when a villain will just turn around and be good. This is also the first series I've read with evil main characters and I want to read more like this. Overall I think the series is 8/10.

kt0ivm,"Harry Potter series and ""Rebecca"" by du Maurier","hey there readers. I'm currently reading ""Rebecca"" by Daphne du Maurier and I'm absolutely loving it. 

At one time Maxim de Winter and his future wife, the unnamed heroine, go for a ride in his car and she's telling him how she would like it if there was a way to keep our memories alive always, like if one could **bottle** memories so they never faint away. 

This hit me hard and possibly you know what I mean if you have read the harry potter series. In the HP universe bottling memories is something ordinary, taken for granted. so I was wondering whether the author of the HP series found her inspiration for that magic in ""Rebecca"".

e448vs,So many things struck me about Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier,"Ahhhhhhh! Just read Rebecca and one thing that struck me was the meek narrator's lovely desire to hold onto moments in time. The way feeling loved finally gave her great strength, how we turn to pets when feeling unloved by others.

kdez1m,Rebecca (du Maurier) vs. a Successora (Nabuco),"Daphne du Maurier has been accused of plagarizing her successful novel ""Rebecca"" from Brazilian author Carolina Nabuco's ""A Succesora"". While these kinds of accusations are common, this one has an extra push going for it: Nabuco wrote her novel in 1934 and sent the manuscript to the same publisher that was working with du Maurier, who was from a privileged family of famous writers. Du Maurier started writing her novel three years later. At least one biographer claims she read the earlier work. Further, a *New York Times Book Review* analysis in 1941 claimed that were were detailed episodes copied from one book to another. However, the Review is currently behind a [paywall](https://www.nytimes.com/1941/11/16/archives/an-extraordinary-parallel-between-miss-du-mauriers-rebecca-and-a.html).

905qmm,"I don't see a lot of discussion about ""Rebecca"" by Daphne DuMaurier. Just read it and it blew me away","SPOILERS from here on in.

Just finished this wonderful novel. I had always been kind of hesitant to pick it up because from the plot synopsis I always though it would be a bland British romance-type story.

Boy, was I wrong. This is gothic literature of the highest order - dark, unsettling and with a psychological depth I've seen in very few novels. The writing is fantastic - DuMaurier really creates a tangible sense of foreboding and a dark ambiance. The book moves for the first 2/3 or so but that's by design, as when we finally find out that Maxim killed Rebecca, it kicks into another gear and turns into a frantic crime thriller.

I also found it a very interesting choice to leave the narrator unnamed - it seemed like DuMaurier wanted to make her as much of an empty cipher as possible to comment on the nature of obsession and how we always find ourselves compared to someone we can't possibly measure up to? It was fascinating how Rebecca, despite never actually showing up in the book, is still the most fleshed-out and developed character. It really brings the point home when Mrs. Danvers tells the protagonist that it's not Rebecca that's the ghost, she is.

I also felt that the narrative was a very good examination of anxiety and insecurity - the narrator is almost cripplingly anxious and doesn't really get much better until she finds out that Maxim killed Rebecca and never loved her. I suppose it's also about toxic, co-dependent relationships as Maxim and the narrator never really properly consummate their love until the truth about Rebecca comes out - her murder brought them together. 

Anyway, I could go on and on. If you choose to analuyze this novel, there's a wealth of stuff in here, but honestly, it works perfectly fine on the surface as well, as a fantastically well-written gothic suspense story. Comes with my highest recommendations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/905qmm/i_dont_see_a_lot_of_discussion_about_rebecca_by/,2018-07-19T13:14:25Z,46,65,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery

rehz1l,Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier - Just speed read through the ending. I picked the wrong side to root for.,"Picked up Rebecca because it was recommended a lot. Had to force my self to go through 60% of the book as I wasn't understanding where the plot was going. Thats a lie. I had accidentally read somewhere that a murder happens, but I didn't read that whole spoiler as soon as I found out it was spoiling. So the reason I went through 60% of the book, even though I wasn't vibing with it is because I knew the ending would be worth it. And boy, ending was good! 

I was half expecting the narrator to be the one to do the murder as she seemed so desperate for affection. I'll probably offend a lot of readers here, but I sped read the heck out of the last 40% of the book. It was finally getting so interesting, and I didn't give a damn for the details. I just wanted to know what happened in the end. Skipped a lot of details. I probably (most definitely) also lost a lot of emotional roller coaster that would have been induced by the details. 

Sad part is immediately after finishing the book, I opened reddit to find out people's opinions on the book. To my surprise, everyone who could formulate a thought on their own ending up hating the narrator's character and felt no pity for Maxim. I on the other hand somehow was completely fooled by the narrator (and by extension the author), and I was rooting for the narrator and Maxim *even though* he is a murderer. Narrator hated Rebecca. I hate Rebecca. Narrator wanted Maxim to not get caught. I didn't want Maxim to get caught.

I mean, others on the Reddit discussions are right. I should not be on the side of Maxim or the narrator. I feel so gullible now and don't think I have a proper moral compass as I thought I would. I need to re-evaluate.

I'll definitely read this book for a second time. And I think I will enjoy the first 60% more now, and definitely not speed read through the last 40%.

kwp8ww,Vera by Elizabeth von Arnim and Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier,"**Spoilers for Vera by Elizabeth von Arnim (1921)  and Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier (1938).**

I just finished Vera and am a bit shook.

The premise of Rebecca and Vera are the same: a naive woman marries an older man she meets on holidays and returns to his gothic mansion only to discover that the house is haunted by the memory of his first wife who died in suspect circumstances. 

Rebecca then turns to fake pregnancies, secret cancer, murder plots, and melodrama to grip the reader. There are twists at every turn.

Vera features no plot beyond Lucy meeting Everard, marrying and the reader discovering that Everard is a narcissistic sociopath. Everard is never physically violent towards Lucy and only snaps at her a handful of times. Vera has no great secret beyond having endured Everard's abuse for fifteen years.

And yet, I found Vera far more gripping and terrifying than Rebecca.

It is a grim and utterly realistic portrayal of an abusive relationship. 

The perspective switches from Lucy to Everard. Lucy constantly making excuses and blaming herself while Everard seethes with indignation. 

>‚ÄúAh, my Lucy,‚Äù he said fondly, ‚Äúlittle waster of happiness‚Äîisn't it better simply to love your Everard than make him unhappy?‚Äù   
>  
>‚ÄúMuch better,‚Äù said Lucy, blinking.

Even though i haven‚Äôt finished the book yet i couldn‚Äôt just reading before talking about how great the build up was.

We were really able to dive deep into the narrator psyche and character and how inconfortable she was at Manderley.

Daphn√© du Maurier is an absolute master when it comes to crafting an oppressive ambiance and a relatable and interesting character.

Mrs Danvers is actually really terrifying, sort of a Yandere but actually done right, extremely well and truly fascinating and actually understandable.

The build up was small but the payoff that began with the dress scene is SO SATISFYING. I can‚Äôt wait to see the ending but my guess is that Maxim actually caused Rebecca death (I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs an accident or a murder yet) and that seeing his new wife on the same dress as Rebecca was like seeing the person you killed miraculously come back to life and ready to destroy you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qvh5m5/i_just_reach_the_first_true_discussion_between/,2021-11-16T20:23:31Z,4,26,books,Rebecca,POST,Mystery

p3wjvu,"[xpost] AskScience AMA Series: I'm Dr. Rebecca Schwarzlose, a neuroscientist who studies brain organization and development, here to discuss the maps in your brain that give you perception, movement, meaning, and mental imagery - and make it possible for new technologies to decode your thoughts. AMA","AMA link on AskScience: [https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/p3l44n/askscience\_ama\_series\_im\_dr\_rebecca\_schwarzlose\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/p3l44n/askscience_ama_series_im_dr_rebecca_schwarzlose_a/)

Hi Reddit! I'm Rebecca Schwarzlose, a cognitive neuroscientist here to talk with you about brain maps and how our little brains create the spectacular range of senses and abilities we enjoy. Did you know that when you imagine a face, you are using the same brain maps that allow you to see and visually recognize faces? Did you know that imagining being touched activates the same brain maps that allow you to feel actual touch? Did you know technologies already exist to eavesdrop on activity in these maps and decode information about what you are perceiving, planning, or imagining?

Here's some info about me: I have a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from MIT and study the developing brain as a postdoctoral scholar in the psychiatry department at Washington University in St. Louis. Together with colleagues Nancy Kanwisher and Chris Baker, I discovered and named a new brain area: the fusiform body area. I have been the chief editor of *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*, a scholarly reviews journal. I have also written a book about brain maps for the public called [*Brainscapes: The Warped, Wondrous Maps Written in Your Brain - And How They Guide You*](https://smile.amazon.com/Brainscapes-Warped-Wondrous-Written-Brain_And/dp/1328949966/) (Mariner Books, 2021). The book was supported by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Program for Public Understanding of Science and Technology.

You can find out more about the book from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/books/review/brainscapes-rebecca-schwartzlose.html), [Publishers Weekly](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-328-94996-7), the [Avid Reader Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqZZxUNTgOo), the [Smart People Podcast](https://www.smartpeoplepodcast.com/episode/377-rebecca-schwarzlose-how-your-brain-interprets-your-reality/), and my [author site](http://www.rebeccaschwarzlose.com/).

vhv53r,The Maid is so bad. How is it ranked at #2 of Goodreads top Mystery/Thriller books for 2022 (so far)?,"Now this is just my opinion, but The Maid by Nita Prose was just awful. It‚Äôs one of the few books I‚Äôve actively told my friends not to read. I was horrified when I saw a post earlier today of Goodreads ranking and saw that The Maid was ranked one of Top Books of 2022 (so far). I had two main issues with the book: it‚Äôs representation of people who are neurodivergent and a bad plot/mystery. 

First, my major issue with the book was the portrayal of the main character, Molly. While not explicitly stated, it is heavily implied that the main character is autistic (or neurodivergent as described in some other reviews). However, the author‚Äôs attempt at writing from the perspective of someone who is neurodivergent is just awful. The author writes the main character as childlike and dumb. 

The worst line in the whole book is near the end where the main character muses that she‚Äôs not good at understanding facial expressions, but if she really tries she‚Äôll be better. The passage is written in a way that makes it seem as if someone who may be neurodivergent only has difficulties because they don‚Äôt try hard enough. I found it to be insulting. For the record, I am not on the spectrum myself, however, a very close family member of mine is on the spectrum . Based on my experience working with and being very close to a number of people with various special needs, I found the portrayal of Molly to be straight up ignorant. Again this is my opinion and others may feel differently based on their lives experiences. (Edited this paragraph for grammar)

Further, the author picks and chooses when the character is ‚Äúhigh functioning.‚Äù The main character understands nuance when it‚Äôs convenient for the plot but not other times when she is easily tricked. Honestly, it‚Äôs just very bad representation.

My second issue with the book was the plot and mystery. Slight spoiler, but I‚Äôve removed all names and major plot points >!There‚Äôs a failed attempt by the author to have the main character serve as an unreliable narrator, but it reads as if the author was just going for a gotcha moment without the set up. Basically, the main character narrates her day in great detail as her character is very detail oriented, but then at the end the of the book the author reveals that ~ surprise ~ Molly knew who the murderer was the whole time but Molly just didn‚Äôt include that information in her earlier narration for some reason.!< if you didn‚Äôt click on the spoiler, basically I said: it was a cheap attempt at a mystery that was not worth it in the end. 

I had other issues with the book but these were the two worst parts that ruined the book for me. IMO, it should not be on anyone‚Äôs to read list let alone Goodreads.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vhv53r/the_maid_is_so_bad_how_is_it_ranked_at_2_of/,2022-06-22T03:16:21Z,288,1226,books,The Maid,POST,Mystery

13ljpbu,Why you should never read The Maid by Nita Prose,"I love reading suspense thrillers and mystery novels. I judged The Maid by its clean cover and expected a good storyline before I picked the book. Unfortunately, I picked this book purely out of impulse without checking any reviews.

The Maid has one of the most boring storylines of all time. For a book that proclaims it should fit in the ""suspense thriller"" category, I could hardly find any twist. 

The first 170 pages in this book are total BS and don't help in any way to how the story proceeds later. The author presents us the protagonist as somebody who's weird, but that doesn't move the character. The character simply is not likeable till the very end.

So why did I read this book fully, you may ask. The reason is because, I still expected a major twist or a break point till the very end. The author moved the story in such a way that you can probably expect something off beat in the end, but it's very disappointing to not see any of that. It's a very very generic story line and anybody would guess how it's going to go.

Do yourself a favour by not purchasing this book. In case you've already bought, leave it as such and don't read. It's okay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13ljpbu/why_you_should_never_read_the_maid_by_nita_prose/,2023-05-19T03:27:34Z,31,13,books,The Maid,POST,Mystery

18gbiq3,"Started ""The Mystery Guest: A Maid Novel Book by Nita Prose"" and want to give up early!","So last year I read ""The Maid"" by Nita Prost (the author's real name Nita Pronovost, she was Senior Management at Simon & Schuster) and thought it was a quaint murder mystery novel. Lots of reviews included the descriptor ""cozy"". 

The main protagonist is a hardworking maid who ends up in the centre of a murder at her place of work, the Regency Grand Hotel. The protagonist is also socially inept....no diagnosis is mentioned in the book, but the ""safe"" routine of cleaning is a comfort to the maid.

But this second book....it's tough to get into! Also the world building in the first book feels stale the second time. And there is no character development at all! Despite the opportunity of character development being presented at the end of the first book. 

Another troubling trend is the tendency to have physical descriptors for the antagonist female characters' physical figures, such as ""large and broad shoulders"" or ""pear shaped"" when no such descriptors are used to describe the body types of the male characters.

The quaint nature of the first book is now becoming more forced ...with the reader encountering teacup after teacup of plot in a contrived manner. The writing seems to wrap you up tightly in a comforter...so tightly that the purported coziness is now becoming heavy.

All the reviews seem so positive? Is there anyone like me who liked the first book....but is tired with this sequel?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18gbiq3/started_the_mystery_guest_a_maid_novel_book_by/,2023-12-12T02:40:10Z,7,5,books,The Maid,POST,Mystery
s19ytg,I just finished The Maid by Nita Prose,"Since it just came out I will give a non-spoilery review for those who haven't read it yet. Molly is an autistic woman and this book is basically about her struggles understanding others. If you're looking for a good mystery, this is probably not it. But if you're looking for a good character study, this is the one.

The book never specifically says that she is autistic, but uses other words to say the same thing. I'm not sure how to feel about that because I kind of would have liked for the characters to outright say Molly is autistic, although at the same time I just appreciate having an autistic female main character at all. She is a very kind and lovable person. You really feel it when others misunderstand or take advantage of her because she doesn't deserve it at all.

I saw a review comparing this to Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine and would agree with that. If you liked that book you will probably like this one. Overall it's a pleasant, cozy read and somewhat fast at less than 300 pages.

Also, it already has a movie deal with Florence Pugh as the lead?? I think she will actually do an amazing job in this role.

ysaghi,The Seven Husbands of Eveling Hugo: I don‚Äôt get the hype,"I picked this book up because of the reviews. It was a fast read. I started yesterday and I‚Äôm already finished. 

It‚Äôs not bad, but not up to hype it got, in my opinion.  

The main romance: the relationship with >!Celia st. James!< felt dry and slightly abusive. 

I kept reading to understand why she picked Monique beside the obvious choice >!about the article on the right to die. That part was clear from the beginning since she was doing a memoir and refusing to say when she could publish!<.  
As soon there was that scene with her driver Nick I had figured it out why she has chosen the protagonist and kept reading until the end. 

It felt shallow and a beach read at best. 
It had zero emotional impact on me and I couldn‚Äôt form a bond with any of the characters except maybe Harry and her second maid.

18hn3yf,Ending the year with one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read: The Space Between Us,"I searched this sub and found almost zero posts on it so I just need to share: The Space Between Us is hands down one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read. I just finished it last night, and out of the other 51 books I‚Äôve read so far this year this one is going to stick with me the most. Thrity Umrigar writes in some of the most beautiful prose I‚Äôve ever read and the story is so beautiful and devastating and original, I normally try to read books as fast as I can but I took my time on this one because reading it before bed was the highlight of my day for the last couple weeks. 

The basic plot revolves a very poor maid/servant named Bhima who works for a very wealthy woman in her home. Thrity actually wrote Bhima off of a real person, a real maid who worked in her home while she grew up. In the book, Bhima is actually very close to the woman and family she works with, but there‚Äôs a constant moral struggle because of their class difference. Each character is so humanized, even the ones who do terrible things, and the ending is one of the BEST endings I‚Äôve ever read, down to the very last paragraph and sentence. It had some of the most powerful quotes I‚Äôve ever read, I wish I had the book next to me so I could include some. 

And I just found out there‚Äôs a sequel that she wrote several years after this one came out, which gets even better reviews, so I had to pay for a new copy on Amazon because I honestly can‚Äôt wait long enough to find it at a used bookstore!

169a7s8,I just read The Blue Castle and it was absolutely the best gateway into the romance genre for me,"As the title says, I just finished reading ***The Blue Castle by LM Montgomery***. This is the first time I have read any sort of romance book, usually I found them a bit too sappy and somehow just not for me but this completely changed my mind. For those who haven't read it, the book follows along the life of a simple maid girl Valancy and how she finds love and how she holds onto said love. 

It was an absolute page turner for me and I couldn't at all stop wishing for things to turn out absolutely alright for everyone at the end of the book. I think this has been one of those books where I have prayed at each page that it should have a happy ending because anything otherwise would be absolutely terrible. The fast descriptions, the passage of time and the growth of characters -- all struck home. While I don't deny that there were a few cliches (no matter how unexpected they were), I honestly welcomed them as they would end up tying the story in quite nicely.

67myqf,"My theory on the ghost story ""The Lady's Maid's Bell"" by Edith Wharton","It's a pretty short story and it's available to read here: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Lady%27s_Maid%27s_Bell 

So I just finished it and was surprised at how vague the ending was. I thought it over and glanced through the story again and came up with some theories. I figured I would just type them out here. It's probably a long shot but I thought maybe someone out is willing to read the story or has read it and will share their thoughts on what happened.

So here is what I think (spoilers obviously): 

I think that whenever that bell rang it would summon Emma's ghost. Obviously the ghost freaked everyone out and made the other servants and the mistress not want to ring the bell. They acted shady while discussing it because well...how does one explain a ghost? 

Yes I think Mrs. Brympton and Mr. Ranford was having some type of affair. At the end he may have had a cane because he jumped out of the window or ran off and hurt myself at the end of the book when the husband was looking around for him. 

I think Mr. Ranford killed Mrs. Brympton and Emma. I think Emma's ghost knew this and was trying to warn that he was going to kill Mrs. Brympton and that is why she led her to his house. It was strange how she just fainted and died. I'm thinking both Emma and Mrs. Brympton were poisoned. 

There was also that weird referencing of dangerous medication during the whole lime water conversation. 

Or maybe Mr. Brympton had something to do with it. 

Yeah...I'm confused.

ore30v,"In the early 1900s, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes creator/writer) was called upon to help solve a real life murder. His help kept an innocent man from life in prison.","Did you know that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle -- the famed author of Sherlock Holmes -- was once tasked to solve a real life crime? The case involved a savage murder, stolen jewelry, an international manhunt, and a wily maidservant who went to her grave knowing far more about the killing than she had revealed...

But I'm getting ahead of myself. So let's get our pipes and funny hats and start from the beginning.

# The murdah

At 82 years old, and living in one of the wealthy neighborhoods of Glasgow (West Princes Street), Marion Gilchrist had a quiet life. She lived alone, but for her hired help, a maid named Helen Lambie. 

On December 21st, 1908, Lambie left Gilchrist alone ‚Äúto fetch the evening newspaper.‚Äù Just after 7:00 PM someone came into Gilchrist‚Äôs house, attacked, and beat the elderly woman to death. 

According to Lambie, she returned from her errand in time to hear a noise in the house then see a man rushing down the stairs. She then found her employer dead on the dining room floor. Papers in the house were ‚Äúransacked.‚Äù Money lying in plain sight was untouched, as was a substantial jewelry collection. 

The only thing missing was a diamond brooch. 

Lambie alerted the authorities. A doctor identified a chair leg as the murder weapon. There was no sign of forced entry. 

# Befuddled and corrupt police just wanted a suspect

Given the lack of forced entry, police assumed Gilchrist had known the attacker. Within 5 days, the authorities arrested a suspect: Oscar Slater. Lambie even identified him as the man she‚Äôd seen running out of the house that night. 

Slater, a 36-year-old Jewish man, was a bit of a traveler. He‚Äôd previously lived in New York, Paris, Brussels, and Glasgow. He and his wife had rented a flat near Gilchrist‚Äôs home. 

Being short on money, Slater had apparently pawned a brooch of his own earlier that month. 

The police found out about the pawned brooch when Slater tried to sell the slip for a ticket to America. They saw a suspect attempting to flee the country. However, Lambie was asked to identify the brooch in the pawnshop. She said it wasn‚Äôt the stolen item. 

The police were undeterred. Despite not being one, they suspected Slater of being a pimp since the man‚Äôs wife had worked at a music hall and was thought to ‚Äúentertain men at home in \[her husband‚Äôs\] absence.‚Äù Oh and according to reports, they had stated:  

>‚ÄúAll murders are committed by undesirables; Oscar Slater is an undesirable; therefore, Oscar Slater committed the Gilchrist murder.‚Äù 

(Dynamite logic, of course!) 

# The game is afoot

Slater, too trusting the judicial system, waved extradition and came back to Glasgow to stand trial. Maybe he thought the evidence was lacking. Maybe he just thought innocence would win out. Either way, he was wrong. 

The Scottish court convicted and sentenced Slater to death in 1909. The verdict generated quite the public outcry. Thus, though scheduled for execution, Slater's lawyer gathered signatures for a petition and successfully got his client's sentence commuted - he was now sentenced to life in prison. 

The public outcry found its way to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle‚Äôs ears. And his Holmes-inspiring mind did not like what it heard. 

# The science of deduction 

So in 1909, the famed author began to re-examine the facts of the case, using some Sherlockian methods. And he noticed some glaring holes in the police‚Äôs case. 

The broach Slater had pawned belonged to a friend, a woman who testified to the fact. And some rumors surfaced that a few witnesses in the police‚Äôs case had been coached. This included their star witness, Lambie. 

This first examination spurred Doyle further. He interviewed new witnesses. He searched for additional evidence. (He even covered some of Slater‚Äôs legal fees). In 1912, Doyle published his findings in The Case of Oscar Slater. However, it wasn‚Äôt enough to garner a retrial. He lost hope and set it aside.

Seven years later, the widow of a Glasgow police officer blew the thing wide open when she reached out to Doyle. She revealed that her husband had kept documents revealing withheld evidence hidden from the public. These documents contained evidence of suspects within Gilchrist‚Äôs family - suspects who apparently had powerful friends. 

# Justice is served, far far too late

A journalist published a piece on the case, highlighting Doyle‚Äôs earlier work. At around this same time, Doyle also received a personal plea from Slater himself. The falsely accused man wanted Doyle to keep digging.

So he did. 

Unfortunately, it took years before Slater was deemed innocent. He was not released from prison until 1927, nearly 20 years after the murder itself. His name was cleared. 

The real killer ‚Äúremains unknown.‚Äù (sure he does, sure.)

# Get your magnifying glass and examine deeper

Wild, huh? Stinks that it took so long to prove Slater‚Äôs innocence, but at least it happened I guess. If you want to check out some longer reads on this one:

10vhrkn,Sherlock Holmes and the economy of the 1860-1890s,"I'm currently reading through the original versions of the Sherlock Holmes books. One thing I have noticed is the amount of money described during their cases. Often it will be in the context of how much a person makes, pays for a certain thing or service. But the one thing I cannot understand is; what did they spend their money on back in the 1860-1890? 

As an example, in one of the stories a man is discribing how much him and his wife, a widower, makes a year.   
He tells that his wifes late husband was well off, and made good investments that returned 7% a year, she is discribed as having a fortune of 4500¬£ - He is said to make around 700¬£ annually from his business.    
So we can calculate their yearly income at 315¬£ + 700¬£ = 1015¬£ annually. Taxes are not discribed, and I do not even know where to begin trying to calculate taxes in the 1880s England.   
The shopkeeper tells mr. Holmes that his wife and himself is comfortable and because of this, they afford themselves a house of 80¬£ a year.   
Meaning that they pay roughly 8% of their annual income in rent. (I would LOVE to only pay that!)   
Furthermore in another story a governess is described to make between 35-120¬£ annually, but 120¬£ being rare. So for the sake of easy mathmatics, let us use the sum of 50¬£ annually.   
This means this couple could hire a governess easily. I'd assume they could also hire a butler, a maid and perhaps one or two more servants and still not pay more than a combined 200-250¬£ wages to their servants.   
So to recap 1015¬£ income - 200¬£ wages of servants - 80¬£ rent = 735¬£ remaining for all other expenses. I would imagine that this would leave the couple rather more than ""comfortable"" - I'd wager that it would put them close to being rich, if not wealthy. They are essentially living compleately off of the dividend of the ladys stocks - Not bad.   


Am I putting too much thought into the discribed economy of the victorian age?   


TLDR: The prices discribed in Sherlock Holmes seems really low compared to the discribed income of the ""customers""",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10vhrkn/sherlock_holmes_and_the_economy_of_the_18601890s/,2023-02-06T20:50:07Z,28,78,books,The Maid,POST,Mystery
18sw4rt,The Housekeepers by Alex Hay,"Anyone read this and want to share thoughts? I can't decide whether I liked it or not! I read a review that said it was like Downton Abbey meets Ocean's Eleven and I am a huge fan of Downton Abbey. I waited months for my turn with the ebook from the library... and overall found it a let down. I guess the story entertained me and I wanted to keep reading, and I became semi-invested in at least one character, and usually that's really what I mostly expect out of a book. But I dunno, I just can't get over what I didn't like... 

First and foremost, I found the plan for and execution of the robbery absolutely ridiculous. Literal acrobatics to steal artwork? A silly amount of men and carts and crates and rope and pulleys, and only one single footman with use of his eyes who noticed anything amiss at all? 

I didn't find the ending all that satisfactory either, at least not for all the characters. I found there were things mentioned or hinted at in the story that never came up again or mattered at all or had any explanation. Ambiguity in an ending is one thing but this wasn't that, really. 

Also just examples of poor writing/errors such as things like ""She looked in her direction for the first time"" when on the previous page they'd made a point of saying she was staring at her. Or having the wrong character say something and then respond themselves. 

And a personal disappointment for me, I didn't find it like Downton Abbey at all besides the obvious, characters being housekeepers, house maids, etc. It didn't immerse me in a different time period/""world"". And sort of related, can't exactly articulate this thought, but for a novel set in London written by a British person, it doesn't ""feel"" English at all let alone turn of the century English. I can't really explain what I mean by that but I think others who read both British and American books will know what I mean by ""the feel"" of the difference. That's not necessarily a fair thing to criticize the book for but I had it in the back of my mind the whole time especially since I was looking for it to feel like Downton for me.

If you don't have access to jstor then I will give you a summary: Ellen Dean (Nelly), the maid, is the central perpetrator to every awful event. While she skews the story in her favor (as concerns Lockwood) she never tells an outright lie. From the series of events we can decipher a person who accentuates the emotional abuse, and manipulates her employers to better her own position. It is not particularly subtle either.

When Cathy (the elder) is dying, she outright accuses Nelly for the first and only time, a sort of epiphany.

*""""I see in you, Nelly,... an aged woman: you have grey hair and bent shoulders.  This bed is the fairy cave under Peniston Crag, and you are gathering elf-bolts  to hurt our heifers; pretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of  wool. That's what you'll come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now.  ... Shake your head as you will, Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me.... Ah!  Nelly has played traitor.... Nelly is my hidden enemy. You witch! So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us!"" (Chapter xii).""*

This distinction is important because for generations Emily Bronte was thought to be a mystery, a woman who created an mad work of some Freudian psycho-analytic delirium, not a sensible and logical woman who wrote a narrative about childhood abuse, manipulation, and selfishness. The great triumphant in the end is when Lockwood does not marry Cathy (the younger) despite that being Nelly's ambition.

What is more interesting than the novel is the generation of readers who could not identify the villainy presented right in front of us, and how that behavior was normalized because of her role as a narrator and her social position as a maid (servants who are consider passive and inactive members of high-society, a sort of misguided notion that the poor uneducated servants are simple folk who have no potential malice or cruelty).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/otl2to/the_true_villain_of_wuthering_heights/,2021-07-28T22:51:58Z,6,63,books,The Maid,POST,Mystery

181cz7t,Shogun gave me what I missed the most in books,"!!!!!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've discovered about shogun recently when  the new film trailer dropped, I instantly was interested as I'm hooked on Japanese culture and learning actively Japanese. 

The book was a fire, intense, stressful to read, dramatic and tragic but also partially satisfying with a dry aftertaste. 

It's so strange that I didn't know that there was a book based on William Adam's life although a lot of fiction in shogun still it highlights a lot William's life, what I found satisfying is that in reality William Aka Anjin-san didn't loose his lover as ( spoiler alert) he did loose Mariko in the book, that was a shocking twist, and the twist of toronaga who had burnt Erasmus in order to keep the barbarian in Japan, I've rarely cried over a book, but I've been crying for quite a long time on this boon.

Now I'm filled with sadness as such a wonderful book came to it's end.


UPDATE : I posted this hours ago in full rush not knowing if people would actually relate to my feedback, Ive been trying to come to my senses since yesterday. This might be a bit long..


Finished the book quite late 3am and been crying for quite a bit and barely had any time to sleep before going to work, impacted my day, barely could concentrate on the work as been thinking about what I have just finished, of course I grinded a lot of info about the original historical figure that actually was a bit relaving.

Generally speaking I always hook on this kind of stories very easily, when the main character who partially represents my own persona goes into unknown  ( had strong feelings with the ""Dances with Wolves""novel/film"" too), it's resonating with my own background quite strongly, that's where the writer succeeded genuinely, Anjin was overwhelmingly expressive person with strong character that wasn't fitting into Japanese culture at first but his honourable and brave side pushed him really far, he's genuine, not open minded at first, kin to knowledge when his crewman were more of a simple kind, I personally been integrating into foreign countries since I was 15 when I abandoned my homeland, so cultural shock is real and it was perfectly represented here, I recall when I first arrived in France I was like 15 years old, I've been shocked how girls would talk, the insults, where in my country it was unimaginable, Shogun handled it perfectly, the pillowing part goddamn ! Been laughing for so long, this part "" maybe he prefers ducks, I heard garlick eaters pillow ducks sometimes"" some of the exchanges were hilarious, and it resonated so much with me it's more like I've been reading about my past self adventures.

Two things struck me hard.

Strangely the Sono's death, the maid, and it's really sad how briefly her death was explained but still was quite terrifying, there's one of the few parts that I think I'd absolutely be broken when seeing such thing in the place of Anjin San who basically wasn't described as reacting in any way on that. 

Mariko's death wasn't as brutal in my opinion, but it hurts, so much, wasn't expecting for a happy ending but hell I cried, I cried a lot, big ass man but that shit hits hard, how much he cared, she was the only thing that made him consider to stay in Japan ( in my opinion) the only thing that helped him to soften the pain of the loss Is the fact that he understood, he's seen the honourable death, karma was it?.

Last thing that hits hard is the Mariko's letter, the 3th time I cried like a baby, I'd probably broke down completely if it was me having that experience and not Anjin-san, astonishingly beautiful love story, how much she cared, if not recalling wrongly I think that she even stated ( in her letter ) that she cared more for him than for anything or anyone else even toronaga himself she choose the barbarian over the ship.

I came also to the conclusion that our Brit hero also in a way saved Mariko and gave her a true happiness and meaning in life before she died, she was clueless about the ""love"" as it wasn't ( and perhaps still isn't ) one of main values of a Japanese culture and mostly to a samurai, as love was partially integrated in a duty in their mind, but even they knew that there was more than that, something extraordinary, but they couldn't express properly or describe it while Anjin felt, expressed, and gave love to Mariko, thus making him as a top priority in her's life. He saved her gave her a purpose, and she saved him sacrificed herself, brave, strong, smart, clever, beautiful woman, no, samurai she was, a strong female character that nowdays people are having hard times to interpret.

Still digesting, wish I could clean my mind and re-read it again, but wanna read it in Jap next time, tried already but still not good enough for such a book, gotta be patient and next year maybe will be able to read it in Jap.

Thanks for your kind suggestions I'll check them all.

12oh8h,A lateral thinking riddle/puzzle book in the form of stories? Searching for a specific one but also up for recommendations!,"Hello, I'm searching for a specific lateral thinking riddle/puzzle book that is in the form of stories.  Normally the riddles are very short (such as, ""A man walks into a bar and asks the barman for a glass of water. The barman pulls out a gun and points it at the man. The man says 'Thank you' and walks out.""), and I've been looking through a number of books at bookstores to find this particular one that I sort of remember years and years ago.  One day in fourth grade, I had a substitute teacher, and he had this book of lateral thinking riddles, but they were short stories.  When we were finished with our assignments, he read some of the stories to us to see if we can guess the answer, and I've been trying to find that book for a while now.  I remember the basic plots of three particular stories:

1)  There was a maid in the story, and she would be stealing these special... beans/nuts or something to eat every single day.  It was a favorite snack for the head of the house (I believe was a lady), and she got really angry finding out that it's been stolen so often.  She knew it was the maid and wanted to accuse her of it, and the riddle was, what were three words that the maid told the lady to ""prove"" she was innocent of the theft?

2)  In this story, there was a man who was at his castle or someplace, either because he was seeking the hand of the princess or he was being tested because he was supposedly really smart, I don't quite remember.  Anyway, one of the last tests involved him in this giant greenhouse of a room filled with flowers.  All of them except one were fake, and the fake flowers were so skillfully done, no one can tell they were fake, so it was like an ultimate test.  The man asked to open the window, and then he knew which one was the real flower.

3)  An elderly man was near death, and he had three sons.  He wanted to make sure that he passed on his wealth to the smartest of the three, so he led them to this big empty room and gave them each a bit of money.  He said they can go out and buy anything they wanted, but the son who filled up the room completely with whatever it is gets to inherit everything.  I think the first son bought straw, and the second son bought something else, but they both barely filled up half the room.  But the third son bought two little items, and he was able to fill up the entire room.

It's a long shot, but does anyone know which book this is?  Also, are there any lateral thinking riddle/puzzle books that are in the form of stories?  At least longer stories than the ones I've seen?

Thank you so much in advance.

1713awe,Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was Spectacular; the Pentology? Not so much...,"I finally hit the point today where I decided to drop reading 'Foundation and Earth', and felt the need to make a post to see if anyone shared my feelings about this book.

The original 3 books of Isaac Asimov's foundation series (Foundation, Foundation's Empire, Second Foundation) are among my favourites. They are a compilation of short stories exploring the organic evolution of a society/organization built around offsetting humanity's greatest dark age after the fall of a galactic empire.

The format these stories helps with their enjoyment greatly. Each story helped to set up logical, worldbuilding consequences of where the last story left off, and chronicle a natural evolution of societal institutions and how they would lead to the reemergence of a post-dark age society. 

While they introduced new characters and their struggles against the institutions that were failing their specific eras, the real fun was in seeing how each individual crisis was solved through the clever thinking of the viewpoint character.

Each of these stories was meant to represent such logical progressions in patterns of history, that it was capable of being predicted for well in advance by the mathematics of a pseudo-messiah.

While not necessarily a hard sci-fi, until the crisis of the last book, which involves an unaccounted for anomaly in the form of ESP, the series is pretty grounded in realistic worldbuilding. 

The fundamental pretense of being about to predict history in advance via mathematics may require a suspension of belief, but I could defend that with enough historical records and meticulous advances in social sciences, it isn't impossible to form a unifying theory of group behaviour that could be contingent on statistical probabilities.

The last two books (Foundation's Edge, and Foundation and Earth), written far later in Asimov's career (and as told in the forward of the former, for a boatload of cash) followed a different format. They were long-form narratives following two (later three) specific characters, as they journeyed across a series of locales in their investigative work, first to hunt down a conspiracy affecting the new galactic government, and then later to find Earth, as it remained a loose end in the viewpoint character's mind.

Foundation's Edge was good, not great. Part of it is a story of two diametrically opposed social institutions being forced into battle with one another, and ultimately falling prey to a wildcard third one. The third institution is somewhat contrived, but the story still had some interesting intrigue.

They also introduce a character who feels a little too ""male fantasy"" for my liking. A psychic hivemind woman who's primary descriptions and actions imply that she is very attractive, who exclusively (and suspiciously) is romantically compelled by the somewhat elderly, professor character. I don't wish to say this is unrealistic or unfeasible, but part of this felt a little too much like a self-insert ""getting the babe"" for my liking.

The story also leans further into ESP, though does so in a way that is at least fascinating. The form which the hivemind takes was different than most other media depictions (like the Borg, Zerg, etc...), and so it was at least intellectually interesting. This drifted the story away from the grounded worldbuilding I spoke about prior, but at least it had something going for it.

There is a conclusive end to the series here, in the form of a decision the main character is forced to make about which institution to rule the galaxy. I find the forced decision contrived as an end for a series about the natural progression of history, and felt a little more like how I would expect a ""choices matter"" videogame to conclude.

Which brings me to Foundation and Earth. I forced myself through two fifths of this novel, and I have finally just given up and read a summary of the rest. 

The inciting incident is weak. It was merely that the main character had an 'intuitive feeling' that there is something important on Earth. The rational being that it is still a mystery to him, the other characters, and the historical record. 

The format of the story is largely the just moving from planet to planet while the protagonists try to gather clues on the location of Earth.

This 'episodic' format isn't necessarily bad, but it is missing the kind of lore that made me fall in love with the original trilogy. 

Where I finally got sick of this series was when they go to a specific planet with a lot of sexual repression. The main character ends up being detained by a woman who appears to be a Spartan-like bureaucrat, but the conflict is resolved with hot, freaky sex. 

Hot freaky sex without nuance too, I might add. Most of the viewpoint character's thoughts are about how rockin' that bod is for an older lady, and more serious psychological exploration into this situation never really comes about.

Despite having deep respect for Asimov's work, and for his impact on culture at large, when I got to this point in the book, I felt like I was reading the work of pervy old man who was untouchable by his editors.

I tried reading past this point, but after a few more pages of what felt like maid-and-butler dialogue, I finally decided that this is too much fluff when I have many other books to read, and just gave up.

Despite my stern dislike of this last book, and my general qualms with the previous one, I haven't seen many opinions online which have shared my viewpoint.

With two other serialized sci-fi series that I love (Dune, and Ender's Game), there are very strong opinions about where to stop reading the series. Yet I have seen much less discourse on the matter about the Foundation Series.

I'm curious as to other people's insights on the series.  Did I miss out on any really interesting pieces on dropping where I did (including skipping the prequels), or did I miss a general consensus to finish after the third book?

What are people's thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1713awe/isaac_asimovs_foundation_trilogy_was_spectacular/,2023-10-06T04:37:59Z,55,85,books,The Maid,POST,Mystery
lqff4t,The Mister by E L James.. I must say I was quite dissappointed. What do you think?,"The Mister by E L James is.... dissappointing to say the least

The plot is very unoriginal.. Allow me to summarise it for you.

Poor innocent girl ( who of course is a maid) meets successful wealthy fuckboy who introduces her to sexual pleasure. when she learns of his title she runs away, he looks for her and confesses his love. She gets kidnaooed. He saves her and so on and so forth..

This book makes me want to tear off my eyes to say the least. It‚Äôs complete rubbisha dn unoriginal. It clear that the author only wanted to write a book with the least amount of effort possible.. 

You‚Äôd think that a successful author would be smart enough to know that such basic romancr plots no longer sell.. But I must be mistaken.. This book is utter trash.. I‚Äôd rather spend my time reading wattpad than ever laying my hands in this book..


Totally would not recommend.

16yp716,"the problems i faced when i started translating "" between the acts "" by virginia woolf - PART3","hello, again, here i go again, throwninng at you a bunch of questions all at once, hoping for an explanation from a generous veteran reader...

_x000D_  
1 - is this a typo?_x000D_  
""Mrs. Giles Oliver drew the comb through the thick tangle of hair which, after _x000D_  
giving the matter her best attention, she had never had shingled or bobbed; _x000D_  
and lifted the heavily embossed silver brush that had been a wedding _x000D_  
present and had its uses in impressing chambermaids in hotels. She lifted it _x000D_  
and stood in front of the three-folded mirror, so that she could see three _x000D_  
separate versions of her rather heavy, yet handsome, face; and also, outside _x000D_  
the glass, a slip of terrace, lawn and tree tops._x000D_  
Inside the glass, in her eyes, she saw what she had felt overnight for the _x000D_  
ravaged, the silent, the romantic gentleman farmer""_x000D_  
_x000D_

 ""isa"" is the one who loves the gentleman farmer not mrs.giles oliver? am i right?_x000D_  
and isa is the wife of the stokebroker, mrs.giles oliver is the wife of mr.oliver right? but why the description there said her hair is so tangled like an old granny? like old mrs.oliver_x000D_  
_x000D_  
_x000D_2 - are the comb and hairbrush two separate tools? so first she drew the comb then lifted the hairbrush? or she replaced one by the other when she saw that it's not gonna help_x000D_  
_x000D_  
3 - so here's the part where i got lost : _x000D_  
"" George grubbed. The flower blazed between the angles of the roots. Membrane after membrane was torn. It blazed a _x000D_ soft yellow, a lambent light under a film of velvet; it filled the caverns behind the eyes with light. All that inner darkness became a hall, leaf smelling, earth smelling of yellow light. And the tree was beyond the flower; the grass, the flower and the tree were entire._x000D_  
_x000D_  
so what hall? what caverns? i know that she doesn't write realistically, but this is not subjective here right? she jumped suddenly from the boy to her contemplations of nature, so here that "" inner darkness "" and "" caverns behind th eyes "" are not attached to one person, it's just the exprience that anybody can have, right? it's not refreing to a specific person having these emotions? _x000D_  
and also, the caverns behind the eyes and the inner darkness refers to the mind, the conscious or the subconscious , right?_x000D_  
and the grass and the tree and the flower became all one whole, it's like unification?                              oh, my god i'm gonna suffer translatiing this meaning in understandable way but i'm up for it._x000D_  
_x000D_  
4 - so here it described mrs.swithin age as "" gallant"", it means noble right? _x000D_  
_x000D_  
5 - ""she had stretched for her favourite reading--an Outline of History--and _x000D_  
had spent the hours between three and five thinking of rhododendron _x000D_  
forests in Piccadilly; when the entire continent, not then, she understood, _x000D_  
divided by a channel, was all one "" _x000D_  
so here it was all understandable until that damnable ""not then"" showed its ugly face, not then refering to the past or to that moment? or to what time exactly?_x000D_  
6 - ""and, she supposed, barking monsters; the iguanodon, the mammoth, and the mastodon; from _x000D_  
whom presumably, she thought, jerking the window open, we descend.""_x000D_  
so is this a wierd version of darwin's evolution theory? we descend from mammoths iguanodon and mastodon? i don't have any tusks..._x000D_  
_x000D_  
7- ""The nurses after breakfast were trundling the perambulator up and down _x000D_  
the terrace; and as they trundled they were talking--not shaping pellets of _x000D_  
information or handing ideas from one to another, but rolling words, like _x000D_  
sweets on their tongues; which, as they thinned to transparency, gave off _x000D_  
pink, green, and sweetness""_x000D_  
_x000D_  
so in this part, the sweets are metaphor for the words, right? it's not real sweets they're chewing, because in arabic when i see a mephor being used or when i use a metaphor in my writings i don't delve in it so much as to tell what  color those sweets gave off. _x000D_  
8 - and this is the last one "" This morning that sweetness was: ""How cook _x000D_  
had told 'im off about the asparagus; how when she rang I said: how it was a _x000D_sweet costume with blouse to match "" _x000D_  
so this part is telling the reader about the diffrent subjects they were talking about, i get that, even though when i first read it i got baffled by the way the sentences jumped from an incident to another until i read it twice and i got it, now can anybody tell me who's cook? is he a cook? and he told off who? and who's the woman that rang ( rang what? a bell? ) is she a lady? and they are maids? and also nurses here meaining baby sitters or something like that, right? not nurses as in hospitals?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
that's it, see you next time with another bag of questions",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16yp716/the_problems_i_faced_when_i_started_translating/,2023-10-03T11:19:56Z,15,0,books,The Maid,POST,Mystery
lxk4ry,"The Ruthless Lady's Guide to Wizardry .. or ""Books that make up their own language and don't bother explaining things""","I WANT to like this book. I am TRYING to like this book. However, there are so many words that are either made up or used in a non-traditional manner that I find it incredibly difficult to get through. My prime example is the use of the word ""household"" ""householder"" ""householded"". Well at first I thought it meant live in maid/slave. Then I thought it meant being bonded as if married but not legally. Then I didn't know what it meant because one lady talked about a man being householded to her but they share the same last name being married...and in the sentence talk about her daughters being householded to people as servants or guards. 

I don't mind made up languages in books, but you need to give a glossary in that case. It makes it difficult to immerse yourself if you have no idea what they are saying. I can't picture relationships between people if you use a made up word to define them and don't give the reader enough context to figure it out. I did ""Google"" householded, etc as well because it may not be made up but possibly a historical dialect that has fallen out of use, but I had no luck.

4lljj6,The Ocean at the End of The Lane Review [Spoiler Discussion],"I recently picked up The Ocean at the of The Lane, mainly because it's enticing cover and the fact that I've heard a lot of good things about Neil Gaiman (the author). 

The book started with a very realistic story, for a moment I thought Neil was writing an autobiography about his childhood. But then, the magic happens and book took me on an imagination roller coaster.

My favorite part about the book was that, if you analyze it, it was all very much real. It was a story about a kid who suffered a psychological trauma, because of a controlling house maid who had an affair with his father and also an abusive father who never understood him and his sediments for books and knowledge. So the only way he could cope with it is by making up stories and creating monsters. 

My only confusion about the book is the ocean, I understand that the boy had a deep longing for knowledge, but I didn't understand completely what the ocean was supposed to mean?

6q69uc,Just finished reading Murder on the Orient Express and while I did enjoy it (having seen the film beforehand years ago) the conductor Michel was kinda BS on Christie's part,"Just gonna throw out the obvious, this is a discussion of the book so there will be spoilers about the mystery and the upcoming film.


Saw the old films years ago but still remembered the big twist solution that made it so iconic. Hadn't read the book before so I wanted to check it out before the new movie.



Liked it throughly and was able to pick up on I'd say most of clues, but the conductor being in on it was total bullshit.



Bouc said he trusted him and had been on the line for 15 years and he should've been the time standard that kept the hallway times in order, but since he was in on it his hallway testimony is useless. And the only way Poirot knew he was in on it was that he was French like the Armstrong's maid and so he could be her father? Total stretch


Went back and read his testimony to see if missed anything, but couldn't see any red flags



Anyone else read the book and have any thoughts on it?



Fully aware how stupid it is to rant about a book from the 1930's



Also I did pause when the German handmaiden said ""The good God should not allow such things.

jsga41,Finished Candide. All is for the best,"\- I finished Voltaire's 1759 masterpiece Candide today, on a gloomy Veteran's Day afternoon. Never has a satire made me so sad (a sadtire?). The philosophy and theology of the times were being lampooned here by Voltaire, and while quite clever, also brought me into a melancholy state of mind about what is truly meaningful in life. There are a plethora of ideas and philosophies, titles and religions that are referenced in Candide, and each end in destruction and/or misfortune. The 18th century was a innovative and romantic time, and yet was also extremely brutal. The book is meant to be witty and humorous, and it totally is, but the brutality naive Candide and Cunegonde, and his mates face is a commentary in the times to which Voltaire lived. I always find so much historical value in the writings of those who came before us.

\- The idea of ""the best of all possible worlds"" or ""all is for the best"" is a notion steeped throughout the book. Voltaire obviously crushes the idea through the misadventures of Candide and Pangloss, who are steadfast in this belief. Pangloss, the promoter of this teaching, sort of uses it as a way to do as he pleases in life. He bangs the castle maid. He speaks candidly to men of greater nobility. And, these errors and his resulting punishments are explained through his belief. Candide, a portrayal of innocence, is a picture of a cruel world devouring that which is ignorant. I felt for Candide, and his pure, foolish love for the radiant Cunegonde whose caste was above his own. Caste systems in Europe were very real, and punishments for fraternization harsh. A culture we have some trouble realizing in our modern society today (though some could argue we still have caste systems in play, just at a more subtle level).

\-I had been on quite a run reading the Bible. We in today's age regard the Book as a monument of antiquity, but in Voltaire's time and work, you can get a real sense about how fervently denominations fought and died for strains of the same religion. Both in Christianity and Islam. Often the pious here are depicted as just as derelict and lecherous as heretics. And they likely were. The Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, literal wars over such small differences in belief. What did that look like? I often wonder what it was like to live in those times, in those great cities, with blood being shed over opinions. What was that like? The burnings, the tortures, the executions, the sieges, the rapes by supposedly devout followers to Holy Beings. It frustrates me to think we have been such a cruel and bloodthirsty people since time immemorial. What is it inside of us that delighted, and sometimes still delights in such evil?

\-Slavery. One of those human institutions that bring out the worst of humanity. Economically a boon in colonial times (and before), slavery always evidences the idea that some societies and races need to have power and dominion over others. Power over race. Power over sex. Power over cultures. Listen to Dan Carlin's Hardcory History episode 'Addicted to Bondage' for a really good commentary on our need to subject certain peoples to such horrors throughout human history.

\- Not to speak too much on the tragedies of Candide, there is plenty that is fun and witty here. The old woman with half a butt cheek killed me. Voltaire's critiques on critics are both clever and relevant to today. This book is filled with wise one liners that are simple and feed the soul. ""Cultivate your own garden."" It is easy to discover why this work is a favorite of many thinkers and revolutionaries of more modern history.  I do not think Voltaire really believed in the pointlessness of it all, but I think this is more of a commentary on enjoying that which is simple. Living in the moment. Dwell not on the treachery of life that we cannot control, especially in light of our recent politics and world condition. Be here. Do well. Do not strive over trivialities. Don't cheat your neighbors, it'll come back on you. Suffer the meek and the innocent. Read Candide. It's 130 pages, a quick read, and it will force you to re-evaluate that which is really important in today's world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jsga41/finished_candide_all_is_for_the_best/,2020-11-11T20:39:05Z,35,82,books,The Maid,POST,Mystery

ourmce,‚ÄúRemains of the Day‚Äù by Kazuo Ishiguro (1989) A brief review and then some questions (with SPOILERS) for those who have read it.,"I remember the movie based on the novel coming out when I was younger, and I had assumed that it was just a period romance piece.  When I saw the book mentioned here and there I dismissed it as much the same.  Then, I needed a new audiobook to listen to, and it was available at the library, so I read a couple reviews and decided to give it a try.

I am very pleased I did, as it was an amazing book.  There are plenty of summaries out there, but it is hard to encapsulate what the book is about.  Yes it involves a butler and a maid, and yes they are the characteristically stodgy British servants of the early 20th century, but it has themes and ideas far outside those plot points.  The narrator (the butler, Stevens) tells most of the story as a reminiscence during his travels.  He is sometimes self-aware of the oddity of being a life-long butler and its effects on one‚Äôs life, but also sometimes oblivious as you would expect of someone having lived such a life.  Ishiguro plays with these themes masterfully.

Without giving too much away, I would definitely recommend this book, especially if you might have written it off as just a period piece or a romance novel.  Also, the audiobook was very good, and the narrator seemed to have the perfect voice for Stevens.  Highly recommend!

 
Now, for some spoiler filled questions for those who have read the book:

>!I kept expected some kind of strange reveal at the end.  Something about the way that Stevens interacted with people (and how they reacted to him) made me think there was something going on with senility, or him having imagined certain things, having believed he was butler to a great gentleman when we was not, etc.  I‚Äôm not sure how to describe all this.!<

>!His conversations with Miss Kenton were obviously stilted due to their formality (especially his) and him being closed off emotionally.  But she also seemed to get oddly upset with him or their conversation would take a strange turn, almost as though he had forgotten they had a relationship or something of that nature.  At the end this mostly turns out to be her getting angry that he would not let down his guard, but that didn‚Äôt always feel true to their interactions.!<

>!There were the scenes of him being mistaken for a ‚Äúgentleman‚Äù which makes sense giving that he is touring around in a car and giving his address as Darlington Hall, but it just added to strange interactions he had with people.  There was also a moment when he was driving with the village doctor and they were talking about dignity, and he says something along the lines of ‚Äúit has to do with not taking one‚Äôs clothes off in public.‚Äù  The doctor doesn‚Äôt really hear him, and the conversation moves on.  It was something jarring to hear from such a buttoned-up butler, and I could not figure out why he would all of a sudden be so ‚Äúvulgar.‚Äù!<

>!Maybe it‚Äôs just Ishiguro‚Äôs style (I've read other Japanese novelists who have that other worldly feel about them), and I know he has written books that have more fantasy/magical type plots, but I just couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it.  Anyone else have thoughts on this?!<",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ourmce/remains_of_the_day_by_kazuo_ishiguro_1989_a_brief/,2021-07-30T19:20:01Z,6,15,books,The Maid,POST,Mystery
9jq2o7,(SPOILERS) Can someone who's read The House of Small Shadows please explain what was happening/the ending?,"I've never read an Adam Nevill book before, but I recently watched The Ritual and rather enjoyed it, so I checked out this one out of my local library. I didn't enjoy it, but also, I honestly didn't understand it either. This isn't a problem I usually have with books, so I think it may have been Nevill's writing in particular, but it makes me feel very dumb. I know the basics, clearly (Catherine works for Leonard, used to date Mike, got fired for fighting Tara, goes to the Red House to perform a valuation of the items for auction for Edith, the niece of a taxidermist/dollmaker) who lives with Maude, her mute maid).

But honestly, anything beyond what was made clearly obvious, I missed. Were they turning children into dolls? Why were they kidnapping disabled girls specifically? Was Leonard a doll? Edith? Like I feel dumb asking those questions, but the description of Leonard's body with his scars and being completely smooth and having no genitals, he sounds like he was turned into a doll. Did it say he had sawdust in him? So was he actually alive (because I feel like that would kill someone) and was made to be doll-like, or was he a dead person who was turned into a doll? Why was Violet turned into a saint? What was the deal with the stuffed rats and kittens? And the gory film they showed the BBC? Who were the people in the town? What was the deal with the pageant? What actually happened in the end? 

I know Catherine was saying she thought she was the figure on the bed, but that it must've been an effigy, and not really her, didn't get that. How was Tara still alive if her body was destroyed like that with Mike's? What's the deal with Catherine's trances throughout the story?

Am I the only one who was confused by this book? The only one who didn't enjoy it? It has very high ratings on Goodreads which I found very surprising.

41f8xv,Fake Books of the Stormed Linoleum: how does this Amazon ebook scam work?,"I'm not talking about books that use catfishing (authors or titles deliberately similar to famous ones), books that are just scraped content off the web, or books sold via fake/purchased reviews or other fraudulent marketing. I'm talking about books like the Stormed Linoleum ""series"": 13 genre fiction books with titles like ""Emperor of the Stormed Linoleum"", ""Lash of the Stormed Linoleum"", ""Linoleum of the Stormed Runelord"".

* There are no reviews or stars for these books
* Their descriptions all read like they were written by a bot and then run though google translate: 
>Nova is specifically a reputation with a appealing experience. Inside of her middle was all hatred and revenge. Will there be a desired destination for appreciate if her center is previously comprehensive?

* While the 13 ""stormed linoleum"" books  are credited to different authors, the authors all seem to have agreed on a common source for artwork and layout.
* If you search the author names, you will find more books with the same layout and more near-gibberish titles/descriptions. The author names themselves don't seem famous.
* Titles seem to be mostly generated from a list of keywords inserted into the phrase ""X of the Y"". Search the kindle store for any pair of words from: stormed, maid, wench, linoleum, angel, emperor, runelord, godslayer. The same authors, layout, and gibberish descriptions show up over and over.

* the content of the books themselves also seem to have been run through google translate, or at least written by a bot.

While automated generation of these books took little effort, if sales was the goal wouldn't they want to add fake reviews as well? The only way these would sell would be if someone purchased them by accident - or out of curiosity about what kind of scam is going on.

Are these attempts by a publisher to do kindle title keyword SEO on Amazon? Have [numbers stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station) moved from shortwave radio to Amazon?

tl;dr: ""The Godslayer of the Stormed Wench"". WTF?

gxj386,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood by Howard Pyle - a whimsical, fantastical, larger-than-life story fit to escape these grim times. Mild spoilers, perhaps.","On a whim I bought The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (illustrated) and it was a fanciful escape from the current events. It tells of adventures in episodic form of Hood and his band in Merry England in the late 1100's that are cheerful, funny, and completely fanciful. The main character is of course, Merry Robin Hood, a cunning but buoyant yeoman seeking adventure whenever it tickles his fancy. He'll outmatch the devious Sheriff with his skills with the bow, with disguise, and his sheer boldness. You'll also meet the aptly named Little John despite his towering muscular frame, and Will Scarlet, named for his flashy scarlet suit and boldly gleeful disposition, among others. The writing style is Old English, filled to the brim with fabulous idioms, colourful descriptions, and embellishments.

In many situations I found myself laughing at their shenanigans and lightheartedness. On many occasions they find others that match them at bouts of quarterstaff. Despite this, one time the troupe find themselves at the mercy of >!a miller and his sack of flour while he bludgeons them for daring rob him, and they end up white all over.!<

Another adventure has the substantial Little John forcing two rich friars to 'pray' for money to appear in their pouches after claiming they had none.

>>!so each put his hands in the pouch that hung beside him, but brought nothing hence.!<  
>  
>>!""Ha!"" quoth Little John, ""have your prayers so little virtue? Then let us at it again.""!<

>!Indeed, with his strong hands holding them down for prayer, and after a few tries, their prayers are finally answered! Behold the gold that divinely appeared!!<

The way they insult so boldly was truly funny. Robin Hood under disguise uses this opportunity to insult the Sheriff with ""gray hairs and one foot in the grave"".

I hadn't consumed anything with Robin Hood in the title before, and only knew him as a man who 'robs from the rich to give to the poor'. In this set of tales, he sarcastically encourages rich passers-by to great feasts of meat and ale for which they then pay their dues (usually much of the excessive gold they carry). I was surprised that Maid Marian is only mentioned once in passing and is not a character, despite hearing of her elsewhere. The final epilogue feels rushed, and >!is quite grim. The author even warns of what's to come and suggests you stop reading:!<

>>!I will not bid you to follow me further, but will drop your hand here with a ""good den,"" if you wish it.!<

5f7lvm,"Thoughts on ""The Handmaid's Tale"" by Margaret Atwood [Mild Spoilers]","*The Handmaid's Tale* has been on my reading list since high school when I was going through a dystopian fiction phase (*A Clockwork Orange*, *Fahrenheit 451*, *The Road*, etc.). But for whatever reason I never got around to reading it.

Now I finally have. And it is remarkable how relevant its politics and story world are. 

Women are essentially property, with the wives of important men being treated as necessary evils to their husbands; with the lower-class working as their maids, and the husbands having possession of Handmaid's, mistresses kept for the sole purpose of being impregnated by the husbands in order to provide children for the wives to raise. 

Atwood takes the concept of women being oppressed to the extreme, and terrifyingly it doesn't seem far from a possible reality. Even to the point where the women justify their positions by endlessly preaching the importance of childbirth. 

But the ingenious vision of Atwood's futuristic world is left underdeveloped due to her dedication to her passive, and unnamed, Handmaid protagonist's internal state; many of the chapters are entirely comprised of her internal monologue with little to no story.  The structure of seeing the protagonist's daily monotony mixed with her fading recollections of her past life, and the brief glimpses of the underlying chaos of the outside world she sees on her shopping trips, is very effective, but when that ends up being the entire novel then it becomes extremely repetitive. Her internal struggles and moral melodramas are only engrossing for so long.

The story is separated by three major set pieces: a childbirth, which reveals the contrast between the delusion of importance the Handmaid's desperately cling to, and the exploitive cruelty of the wives; the protagonist's trip to an underground hotel for the important men where they fetishize the past, and the part of the story I think could have been much stronger; and a reaping, where women who disobeyed the laws of the nation are publicly punished - and it is truly terrifying. 

Each of these are the highlights of the story, giving us a glimpse of the realities and true consequences of Atwood's vision, and also gives life to the protagonist who must actively experience and endure these horrific situations.  But when we are regularly returned to being confined inside the protagonist's head through her day-to-day passive monotony, the story feels as sucked of life as she is (which is an effective tactic, but not for all 300 pages). 

The ending feels like the start of the final act, not the end of the novel. It could've (and probably should've) come sooner, and it would've given Atwood the ability to explore the more vaguely established layers of her intricately designed dystopia.

1o0uwj,"After blitzing through The Maias in a week and a half, I'm newly enamoured of E√ßa de Queir√≥s. It's a pity he isn't better-known.","Unless you've got a taste for the literature of the Iberian peninsula, or read European 19th-century literature regularly, you've probably never heard of this guy. Neither had I, until I spent a gap year in Brazil, and then supplemented my long, hard slog with the Portuguese original with the recently published translation by Margaret Jull Costa.

So let me say: for some bizarre reason, the rest of us seem to be missing out on this guy. He's hard to describe, but in some ways he's the 19th-century novelist for people who don't like 19th-century novelists. De Queir√≥s was a Realist (and a very good one at that- indeed, Zola said he was greater than Flaubert), and above all a master satirist of contemporary Portuguese society. He spent much of his life abroad, in Britain and France, which of course were rising industrialized powers...and Portugal had lost its empire, its geopolitical importance, and much of its money; it didn't have much of a bourgeoisie, was tied down by a corrupt Church, and was overseen by a class of aristocrats who weren't good for much except drinking, spending money irresponsibly, and seducing each other. There's a melancholy undercurrent of futility in his work, that of an intellectual and a humanist who desperately wants to drag his native land into the modern age, but recognizes the hopelessness of the project. It's certainly a recurring feature of *The Maias*: the main characters are all bright young things, studying medicine and writing poetry and embarking upon grand, experimental novels about the New Science and Progress...which they never get around to because they're too busy being dapper young bucks and seducing half of Lisbon. (And, indeed, Portugal kept declining; the Republic established just before the Great War was short-lived, soon to be overtaken by Ant√≥nio de Salazar's fascist Novo Estado, and the democracy that replaced his r√©gime has more than its fair share of problems at the moment.)

He's a marvelous writer, with a frankness, a precision, an honesty, that is unique to him. Would anyone else have dared to write:

*He was constantly in and out of the maids' rooms, rummaging about in drawers; he would finger their dirty petticoats and sniff the padding they wore in their clothes.* (excerpt from *The Crime of Father Amaro*)

The English, French, Russians, even the Realists among them, had an uptightness that de Queir√≥s had little interest in preserving; no corner of Portuguese society- its dissolute elite, its corrupt and ungodly Church, its forgotten people- is safe from the needle of his writing. (Unsurprisingly, de Queir√≥s was controversial in his own time; but today, it's said that the Portuguese don't remember the late 19th century as it was, but as de Queir√≥s wrote it.) His books are long and his sentences aren't short, but there's a quickness, a freshness, to his writing that is absent in, say, Dickens. And you don't even get the excuse that you don't read Portuguese, because the much-acclaimed and brilliant Margaret Jull Costa has translated a number of his books and is working on others. Read him, man.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1o0uwj/after_blitzing_through_the_maias_in_a_week_and_a/,2013-10-08T23:49:53Z,2,10,books,The Maid,POST,Mystery
2swcs0,"In The Picture of Dorian Gray, does anyone understand the conversation between Lord Henry and the Duchess?","""You don't like your country, then?"" she asked.

""I live in it.""

""That you may censure it the better.""

""Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?"" he inquired.

""What do they say of us?""

""That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.""

""Is that yours, Harry?""

""I give it to you.""

""I could not use it. It is too true.""

""You need not be afraid. Our countrymen never recognize a description.""

""They are practical.""

""They are more cunning than practical. When they make up their ledger, they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.""

""Still, we have done great things.""

""Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys.""

""We have carried their burden.""

""Only as far as the Stock Exchange.""

She shook her head. ""I believe in the race,"" she cried.

""It represents the survival of the pushing.""

""It has development.""

""Decay fascinates me more.""

""What of art?"" she asked.

""It is a malady.""

""Love?""

""An illusion.""

""Religion?""

""The fashionable substitute for belief.""

""You are a sceptic.""

""Never! Scepticism is the beginning of faith.""

""What are you?""

""To define is to limit.""

""Give me a clue.""

""Threads snap. You would lose your way in the labyrinth.""

""You bewilder me. Let us talk of some one else.""

""Our host is a delightful topic. Years ago he was christened Prince Charming.""

""Ah! don't remind me of that,"" cried Dorian Gray.

""Our host is rather horrid this evening,"" answered the duchess, colouring. ""I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern butterfly.""

""Well, I hope he won't stick pins into you, Duchess,"" laughed Dorian.

""Oh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me.""

""And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?""

""For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually because I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by half-past eight.""

""How unreasonable of her! You should give her warning.""

""I daren't, Mr. Gray. Why, she invents hats for me. You remember the one I wore at Lady Hilstone's garden-party? You don't, but it is nice of you to pretend that you do. Well, she made it out of nothing. All good hats are made out of nothing.""

""Like all good reputations, Gladys,"" interrupted Lord Henry. ""Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be a mediocrity.""

""Not with women,"" said the duchess, shaking her head; ""and women rule the world. I assure you we can't bear mediocrities. We women, as some one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if you ever love at all.""

""It seems to me that we never do anything else,"" murmured Dorian.

""Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,"" answered the duchess with mock sadness.

""My dear Gladys!"" cried Lord Henry. ""How can you say that? Romance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art. Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.""

""Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?"" asked the duchess after a pause.

""Especially when one has been wounded by it,"" answered Lord Henry.

The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression in her eyes. ""What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?"" she inquired.

Dorian hesitated for a moment. Then he threw his head back and laughed. ""I always agree with Harry, Duchess.""

""Even when he is wrong?""

""Harry is never wrong, Duchess.""

""And does his philosophy make you happy?""

""I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I have searched for pleasure.""

""And found it, Mr. Gray?""

""Often. Too often.""

The duchess sighed. ""I am searching for peace,"" she said, ""and if I don't go and dress, I shall have none this evening.""

""Let me get you some orchids, Duchess,"" cried Dorian, starting to his feet and walking down the conservatory.

""You are flirting disgracefully with him,"" said Lord Henry to his cousin. ""You had better take care. He is very fascinating.""

""If he were not, there would be no battle.""

""Greek meets Greek, then?""

""I am on the side of the Trojans. They fought for a woman.""

""They were defeated.""

""There are worse things than capture,"" she answered.

""You gallop with a loose rein.""

""Pace gives life,"" was the riposte.

""I shall write it in my diary to-night.""

""What?""

""That a burnt child loves the fire.""

""I am not even singed. My wings are untouched.""

""You use them for everything, except flight.""

""Courage has passed from men to women. It is a new experience for us.""

""You have a rival.""

""Who?""

He laughed. ""Lady Narborough,"" he whispered. ""She perfectly adores him.""

""You fill me with apprehension. The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us who are romanticists.""

""Romanticists! You have all the methods of science.""

""Men have educated us.""

""But not explained you.""

""Describe us as a sex,"" was her challenge.

""Sphinxes without secrets.""

She looked at him, smiling. ""How long Mr. Gray is!"" she said. ""Let us go and help him. I have not yet told him the colour of my frock.""

""Ah! you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys.""

""That would be a premature surrender.""

""Romantic art begins with its climax.""

""I must keep an opportunity for retreat.""

""In the Parthian manner?""

""They found safety in the desert. I could not do that.""

""Women are not always allowed a choice,"" he answered.

tj6agt,My thoughts on The Brothers Karamazov - A Mirror of Humanity,"Within three brothers are shown the breadth of humanity, the extremes it can go from either end, but more importantly, just how similar those extremes can end up being. An almost airy, breezy sort of writing carries this truth, recalled by a narrator who isn't anyone special, but just a local observer. His observations are straightforward and true, biting and unflinching, sometimes funny, and sometimes very hurtful in the raw nerve it exposes; a nerve that anyone can find in themselves if they look inwards. This is the deceptive simplicity of a master writer, and The Brothers Karamazov is certainly a masterwork done by such a writer.


Those three brothers and their abhorrent father make up the book. The eldest, Dmitri Fyodorovich Karamazov, is a neglected hotheaded man. The middle, Ivan Fyodorovich Karamazov, is an educated atheist who struggles with his own moral failings and human weakness. And the youngest, through whose sincere eyes we see this corrupted, tragic world, Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov. Our narrator begins by telling us Alexei is his protagonist. Alexei is a godly man who is eventually taken in by the Elder Zosima, and who struggles to see the good in the world while all around him seems resigned to tragedy.


Their father, Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov, is one of the worst displays of humanity imaginable. He is a hedonistic swine, a rapist, and proud of his failings. With him, we see how disadvantaged his children enter the world; we see how easily the air of tragedy and misfortune that surrounds these characters, seems almost inevitable. The book's plot revolves around his murder, but the real catalyst of all it is concerned with, comes from him being an absent father and worthless human.


And so preceding his murder, is his affair with Grushenka, a woman whom both himself and his son, Dmitri, covets. Dmitri is accused of having killed his father for his money, so as to lure Grushenka away. The entire second half of the book is given to the investigation of the murder and Dmitri's trial. But to say that The Brothers Karamazov is only a murder mystery would be missing the point.


This is a book that balances between the immediate passions of humanity, and the philosophy and psychology behind it. Dostoevsky shows both brilliantly, going deeply into the emotions and psychology of his characters, and of Man in general, and also showing the very immediate conflict of the love triangle, which in turn shows the emotions and psychology in practice. This comes together to give a picture that becomes almost a mirror of Man. The biggest impression I had when reading this book was just how true it was. Every character is real. I cannot emphasize this enough. It felt like reading the chronicles of very real people who lived long ago. That this is a work of fiction is the most unbelievable thing about it. 


Surrounding the murder is the exploration of philosophy and psychology, the natures of men and society in general. At its heart, this is what The Brothers Karamazov is really concerned with. It begins with the discrete portraits of very different men: the three Karamazov brothers. Each, at first, represents a very different type of man, incongruent with the other. As we continue, we see that they are not so different, not so discrete. The gulf of difference, from morals to baseness, theism and disbelief, righteousness and fallen, are not so large. Each brother ends as merely a slightly different reflection of the other, not so far apart as to have been first expected.


Dmitri is base and impulsive. He is much like his father at first glance. He would compare himself to an insect in his sensuality; he has an evil insect nature. Though he has a sense of honor, also, his passion is what rules him, just as it rules his father. Dmitri is married to a noble, proud and yet tender-hearted woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He falls in love with the low born, manipulative Grushenka. His marriage is borne out of his own manipulation, his own baseness at needing to see someone he thinks is above him, humbled at his feet. And yet his honor kicks in and he cannot live with himself. He flies instead to a woman who uses him, who does the same as he had done to Katerina, and he finds escape in his suffering and endless love for her. Dmitri has no delusions about who or what he is. He and his father fight over Grushenka, and Grushenka couldn't care for either of them; she doesn't care until tragedy strikes her as well. It is because of her that Dmitri is accused of murder.


Ivan is well educated and at war with himself. He is an atheist, but not one who disbelieves in God's existence, but one who has lost belief in God the way one loses belief in one's parents. His musings on God are famous beyond this book. The Grand Inquisitor chapter, a chapter where he puts himself as an aged inquisitor who intends to sentence the returned Christ to death, is amazing. This chapter is up there with The Dead by Joyce, The Beggar Maid by Munro, all of Snow Country, and all the great things I've read. This chapter shows Ivan's philosophy, but also his turmoil and desperation to believe. The old inquisitor believes Christ is proud and that only a chosen few can live up to his ideals. The rest shall suffer and so it is up to the disbelieving church to shepherd these forgotten. In this we see Ivan's struggle as he believes he cannot live to Christ's standards; he is destined for ruin. And in the end, when Christ kisses the inquisitor and is freed by that man, we see a glimmer of Ivan's true self: he wishes he could be better. Adding to his struggle, he is also in love with Dmitri's fianc√©, Katerina. He is tortured by her rejection and loyalty to his wanton brother.   


The youngest brother, Alexei, is a pious man of great fortitude. Compared with his brothers, he is free from scandal and outward conflict. He lives in a monastery with the Elder Zosima, a man who is like a father to him. When the elder dies, Alexei is instructed to sojourn the world. Through him do we see many of the book's happenings; his judgement is respected by all, and his understanding and blessing is often sought. Though outwardly calm, after Zosima's death we see his own personal turmoil and struggles. Alexei has moments of disbelief, just like Ivan, and he is passionate just like Dmitri. 


The three brothers begin apart in character but become closer as things go on. Dmitri's musing on his insect-like nature is not so different from Ivan's belief of being unable to live up to Christ's standards. And Alexei struggles himself to live up to those standards. All brothers are human and flawed; they simply bear their burdens differently.


The book goes into many of their conflicts and many other stories and examinations of other characters. There is a deeply poetic nature to its examination of humanity; everything comes round again, and things match and contrast in interesting ways. Alexei's childhood is defined by his memories of his mother praying for him. The book ends with him telling some children the importance of having and cherishing memories from one's parental home. 


Fatherhood is shown in all its spectrums and with all its consequences. Fyodor is contrasted with the peasant father, Snegiryov, who loves his son. Fyodor is murdered by his child; Snegiryov loses his son. Progress is shown slowly: Fyodor rapes a vulnerable Lizaveta while his son, Alexei, assists, and perhaps may even help find salvation, another young, vulnerable Lizaveta.


All this brings out the emotions and truth of the book more strongly. The murder then, which comes halfway through, only gives further excuse for deep personal examinations.


And what what examinations there are. Dmitri's trial and investigation is full of candid observations about life and people. We see psychology weaponized by prosecutor and defense. The defense calls it 'a stick with two ends' and shows how one can draw many conclusions from the same facts. We see this personified in how very different all three brothers are coming from the same place, and also how similar they are despite the gulfs between them.


That we know coming into the trial who the real murderer is, makes it even more impressive how persuasive either side can be. I saw where the prosecution was coming from and even agreed with them; then I turned coat when the defense had their chance to speak, proving without a doubt Dmitri's innocence.


The murder and trial end the book. We learn that it is Fyodor's bastard son who kills him and frames Dmitri. This son, Smerdyakov, represents a failed Russia, a failed society. The offspring of a rape victim being destined to serve his mother's rapist, his only chance at life was to steal the money Fyodor had in such abundance. But is he the only murderer? He plunged the blade but did he wield the knife? Ivan's guilt over his father's death wracks him. His father is killed by one who subscribes to a reductive understanding of his philosophy. Even worse, Ivan tacitly, and perhaps unconsciously, gives permission for the murder by going away and giving Smerdyakov the opportunity to kill. Ivan tries to exonerate Dmitri with his confession but he is too far gone with brain fever having carried this guilt. He wants to live up to Christ's ideals, but he is not strong enough.


At the end of the trial, Dmitri is found guilty. The book ends with a plan to escape with Grushenka to America, and then finally to return to Russia as Americans. Failed by his father and then his country, he hopes to return as someone else. But the outlook and future is not bright for him. The very last chapter is the funeral of the peasant father's son where we see Alexei inspire the children to be good and always hold in their hearts the good memories which will be their salvation. This ending shows that the base Karamazovian instinct can be overcome; that good can be sowed and reaped for a more hopeful future. It is a fine ending, but what really sticks with me is the chapter prior, the chapter of Dmitri's and Katerina's last meeting. Here, they confront each other honestly and tenderly. Here the truth of Dostoevsky's writing is synthesized so strongly, and I think that chapter speaks for the overal feeling of the book. They are melancholic and know they both will forever suffer, but they find comfort in the moment. Katya says to Dmitri:


‚ÄúAnd you do not need my forgiveness, nor I yours; it‚Äôs all the same whether you forgive or not, all my life you will remain a wound in my soul, and I in yours - that‚Äôs how it should be‚Ä¶,‚Äù


A wound in the soul is perhaps the universal binds for each character in The Brothers Karamazov. Reading it, at times, also gave me one. But that is how it should be. There are many truths in this book, too many to touch on, but it never loses sight of the immediate nature of Man either. This isn't a book full of dense musings and academic philosophy, but of true life unfolding. Vibrant life; tragic life; love and yearning. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tj6agt/my_thoughts_on_the_brothers_karamazov_a_mirror_of/,2022-03-21T07:42:33Z,1,31,books,The Maid,POST,Mystery
hjuz0q,'The Remains of the Day' by Kazuo Ishiguro: An analysis of the character of Stevens and his notion of idealistic professionalism in the novel,"In Kazuo Ishiguro's [*The Remains of the Day*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28921.The_Remains_of_the_Day), the character of Stevens is something of a tragic hero ‚Äì flawed but sympathetic at the same time, and evoking equal parts admiration and pity. An ageing butler who has dedicatedly provided his service to a great house for over three decades, Stevens is in the twilight of his career in the post-war England of the mid-twentieth century where the book begins. As he sets out on a holiday in the countryside at his current employer's insistence and launches into a series of reflections on his past, the narrative becomes by turns a travelogue and a memoir. These dual but parallel journeys ‚Äì the literal one through the countryside and the metaphorical one through the past ‚Äì become by extension a probe into class, culture and politics. But they also simultaneously tell a story of loss and regrets; a story of a man who gives his all to duty and as a consequence achieves little in the way of desire.  

At one point in the narrative Mr Farraday, Stevens' current employer and the new American owner of Darlington Hall where Stevens has served all this time, demands of Stevens to confirm (in a rather demeaning manner for someone who has otherwise been portrayed as a genial man) that the latter is 'a genuine old-fashioned English butler' and that he has paid for 'the real thing'. Ignoring this obvious objectification of his person and the borderline fetishization of his descent, Stevens responds in the affirmative. And he is indeed a butler of the highest order. Earnest and precise in his tasks, unwaveringly loyal, conscious of propriety, and refined in both manner and speech, he is what remains of the old days ‚Äì an embodiment of what has now come to be termed as Englishness and a representative of the class of great English butlers who were a part-and-parcel of prominent estates.   

But underneath the mask of cold professionalism, there is a turbulent soul that seeks to reconcile the past and the present, or more precisely, the choices made (or not made) in the past and their consequences in the present. This interplay of choices and consequences, duty and desire, takes place on the larger plane of identity, which emerges as a key theme in the novel.  

Stevens' identity is inextricably linked to his profession as a butler. Almost everything that he thinks or does is directly or indirectly tied to his profession. And this fact becomes evident from the very opening scene where Stevens prepares to undertake a trip to the countryside and decides that it could be 'put to good professional use', which indicates a certain obsession with work. In modern lingo he would be easily dubbed as a 'workaholic'. Even while deliberating on the clothes to wear on the trip ‚Äì which his employer expressly and generously sanctions as one for leisure rather than work ‚Äì he makes the calculations through the lens of his job as a butler at Darlington Hall, and concludes that he must be dressed appropriately as there is no saying when he might have to reveal his association with Darlington Hall over the course of the trip. This literal (and seemingly trivial and pompous) choice regarding his attire actually extends to and is interwoven with his principles of professionalism and the interconnected ideal of 'dignity' at large.   

> *'The great butlers are great by virtue of their ability to inhabit their professional role and inhabit it to the utmost; they will not be shaken out by external events, however surprising, alarming or vexing. They wear their professionalism as a decent gentleman will wear his suit. [...] It is, as I say, a matter of ""dignity"".'*   

Stevens inherits this code of professional conduct, as we eventually learn, from none other than his father who was once a 'great' butler himself. Back in his day Stevens Sr had confronted a certain dilemma in his career, and his response to it had been as poignant as it was awe-inspiring. The dilemma, as Stevens narrates it, had been this: A certain General had arrived as a guest at the estate of his father's then employer. It turned out that this General was the man responsible for the death of his elder son in the South African War. His personal feelings towards the guest had therefore been anything but fondness. Meanwhile, a series of circumstances demanded that someone serve as a substitute for the General's valet through the entire duration of his stay. Aware of the significance of the General's visit for his employer's business aspirations, Stevens' father volunteered himself. And not only did he carry out his duty, he carried it out to the best of his abilities, despite having to suffer close proximity to the man he loathed and without giving the slightest inkling of his personal feelings. Between his professional commitments and his personal feelings, he prioritized the former while suppressing the latter.  

It becomes evident over the course of the narrative that, among other things, the account of this event in his father's career leaves a significant impact on Stevens' psyche and contributes to the making of his own professional ambitions. The 'dignity' which, in his view, his father came close to being an embodiment of, is what he strives to achieve himself, and as a result he finds it difficult to divorce his professional identity from his private one. Furthermore, underpinning this pursuit of 'dignity' ‚Äì as the story of Stevens' father demonstrates and as Stevens himself is to put into practice over the course of his career ‚Äì is the ability to exercise emotional restraint in the face of challenging situations, or in any situation where one is in a professional capacity, for that matter.  

Essentially, Stevens sees emotions as an impediment to professionalism. Being reticent and self-effacing is, in his view, the proper conduct for any butler worth his salt. And he makes this point by drawing upon the presumed 'greatness' of the English landscape owing to its 'lack of obvious drama or spectacle'. Like Wordsworth who reminisced about his life as he gazed at the beauty of the countryside in his poem *Tintern Abbey*, Stevens takes in the sights around him and comes to the following conclusion about his country's landscape, straddling the line between patriotism and prejudice.    

> *'...I would say that it is the very* lack *of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart. What is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty, its sense of restraint. [...] In comparison, the sorts of sights offered in such places as Africa and America, though undoubtedly very exciting, would, I am sure, strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness.'*    

The irony of this dogmatic critique lies in the fact that until now he has hardly ever ventured anywhere outside of the premises of Darlington Hall, let alone having toured a foreign country. But he goes on to correlate this perceived quality of the English landscape to the existence of butlers as being an exclusive attribute of England.  

> *'It is sometimes said butlers only truly exist in England. [...] I tend to believe this is true. Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race is capable of.'*  

This is one of the first glimpses into how opinionated Stevens can be. For all his gentlemanly behaviour as necessitated by his job as a butler, Stevens is internally quite critical of anyone who does not live up to his standards or share his views on what constitutes 'good' professionalism. His tirade against the conduct of fellow butlers, housekeepers and servants who have proven to be anything less than perfect in their work, paints him as a rather snobbish and intolerant man.¬† 

In a similarly opinionated manner, Stevens asserts at one point that a butler's professional prestige is determined by the moral worth of his employer, and that true 'greatness' for a butler lies in serving gentlemen who work for 'the progress of humanity'. As such, as he looks back on his years of service to Lord Darlington, his late former employer, he claims that he takes great pride in having served his lordship who dedicated his life to many a great affairs of both national and global significance. This adulatory narration around Lord Darlington is, however, undermined by a recurring emphasis on the low opinion of the man among the general public owing to his antisemitic inclinations and liaison with Nazi sympathizers. Stevens' attempt to defend his former employer against allegations of treachery is ironically marred by his own narration of the political affairs the latter was involved in. One notable instance of this is when Lord Darlington orders the dismissal of a pair of housemaids on the grounds that they are Jews. Stevens knows in his bones that it is wrong but complies, despite the protests of Miss Kenton, the housekeeper.¬†  

> *'...my every instinct opposed the idea of their dismissal. Nevertheless, my duty in this instance was quite clear, and as I saw it, there was nothing to be gained at all in irresponsibly displaying such personal doubts. It was a difficult task, but as such, one that demanded to be carried out with dignity.'*¬†  

Stevens therefore maintains his professional integrity at the expense of his conscience and morality. Lord Darlington's political exploits turn out to be unethical and misguided. But Stevens, who has conditioned himself to believe that his employer is invariably a 'better judge' than he can ever hope to be, pacifies his prickling conscience by justifying it as his professional duty. What he repeatedly insists is a matter of pride to him therefore unravels itself as a matter of disgrace, though he never explicitly refers to it in those terms.¬†¬†

Most of what Stevens calls the 'turning points' in his career pan out in a similar manner ‚Äì with a sense of loss underlying his successes at every turn. His professional achievements are always at the expense of something of personal significance to him.¬† 

When his father, who has been tentatively serving as an under-butler in Darlington Hall, falls critically ill and requires both medical attention and moral support, Stevens simultaneously has another crucial matter to take care of downstairs ‚Äì the smooth running of an international conference of immense significance to Lord Darlington and his political aspirations. In the tug of war between professional and personal duties, Stevens ultimately lets the former prevail. In the process he takes a decisive step towards being the 'great' butler he aspires to be, and earns much admiration from his employer, his employer's guests and his peers for his flawless execution of duties in the face of numerous difficulties and distractions. But these are at the expense of his duty as a son towards his father and, perhaps more importantly, his own emotional wellbeing. He justifies his choice by reminding himself that what he does is exactly what his father would have wanted him to do, and he might not have been wrong on that account in another situation. However, it is possible that, lying on his deathbed, the old man would have wanted deep down for once nothing more than having his son close by. When he regrets that he has not been a good father, which Stevens neither confirms nor denies, he most likely alludes to his own sacrifice of duties towards his family for the sake of his profession and his role in having his son grow up with the same mindset.¬†  

Years later Stevens finds himself confronted with a situation that eerily mirrors the day he lost his father ‚Äì a day of importance for his employer and a group of eminent guests to attend to, requiring him to be on his toes at all times ‚Äì and it brings with it yet another loss. When Miss Kenton announces her decision to get married and resign from her post in Darlington Hall, Stevens tries to maintain a calm and composed exterior, and hastily excuses himself under the pretext of attending to 'matters of global significance taking place upstairs'. At the end of the day he claims feeling a 'sense of triumph'.¬†  

> *'...a deep feeling of triumph started to well up within me. [...] I had, after all, just come through an extremely trying evening, throughout which I had managed to preserve a ""dignity keeping with my position"" ‚Äì and had done so, moreover, in a manner even my father might have been proud of. And there across the hall, behind the very doors upon which my gaze was then resting, within the very room where I had just executed my duties, the most powerful gentlemen of Europe were conferring over the fate of our continent. [...] I can see few other explanations for that sense of triumph I came to be uplifted by that night.'*¬†  

Stevens rationalizes that the 'sense of triumph' he feels that evening is on account of having successfully executed his duties in the presence of 'the most powerful gentlemen' whose meeting under the roof of his employer is to have a global and historic significance. However, it is more than that. The evening was 'extremely trying' not only due to the physical exertion of his work and his confrontation with Mr Cardinal regarding Lord Darlington, it was so also due to Miss Kenton's sudden announcement of her intent to get married. The emotional turmoil he experiences, however, is so incongruous with his self-imposed code of professional conduct that he refuses to acknowledge his dormant romantic interest in Miss Kenton. The 'sense of triumph' then stems from a sense of relief for having been able to exercise restraint in the face of emotionally distressing news that threatened to tear down his walls.¬†  

This detached response to most things ‚Äì especially those that are of a personal significance, such as his father's death and Miss Kenton's resignation and subsequent marriage ‚Äì become an exercise in not only deluding the reader but also in deluding himself. Peter Beech, in [an article in *The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/07/the-remains-of-the-day-by-kazuo-ishiguro-book-to-share#comments), describes Stevens as an 'unwitting narrator' ‚Äì a unique variation on the literary device of the unreliable narrator ‚Äì who 'remain trapped in self-preserving fictions, mysteries even to themselves.' Many of Stevens' claims, assertions and reflections, on closer inspection, only serve to remind the reader that the man doth protest too much. It almost makes one wonder if his intent to use the trip to the countryside as an opportunity to persuade Miss Kenton to rejoin the housekeeping staff at Darlington Hall ‚Äì a purpose as professional as it can get ‚Äì is perhaps, at some level, also driven by a very personal longing to simply meet the love he had let go of (though of course he knows better than to admit this). There are several instances where he unintentionally reveals too much, deconstructing or contradicting the point he attempts to make. These constant attempts at self-deception come to a head when he's forced to finally look the truth in the eye and confront the hollow and meaningless shell that his life has become.¬†   

Stevens' single-minded pursuit of 'greatness' in his profession leaves one to wonder: To what extent is he simply a product of his time and upbringing, shaped by the demands of his professional circuit and society at large; and to what extent are his principles self-imposed?¬†  

There's certainly the influence of his father to account for. And there's certainly a degree of importance attached to household management and butlers in Stevens' time, as is evidenced by the existence of the Hayes Society and its set of stringent criteria for membership. But there are also instances scattered throughout the story where butlers and servants of varying ranks put their personal desires over their professional commitments and prospects of career advancement, and get away with as few repercussions as they can avoid. Sure, they probably forever lose their chance to make a name for themselves or get recruited into more prestigious households; but that was never a concern for the housekeeper who elopes with the under-butler or the maid who elopes with the footman, in the first place. Miss Kenton herself chooses to (legitimately) resign in order to marry and start a family, and her choice is never contested from a professional angle. Thus, commitment to one's profession, while valued and sought for, is not such a matter of life and death as Stevens makes it out to be. Stevens, with his extremities and rigidity, is more of an anomaly than a reflection of the general populace of his time.¬† ¬†  

But that is precisely what sets Stevens (and his father and their likes) apart from the rest ‚Äì that is, the 'less ambitious' crowd that is content with being average to decent at their jobs, never aiming higher than the bare minimum of what is expected of them, and sometimes even willing to forsake their achievements and prospects in exchange for fulfilment in other areas of life. Meanwhile, Stevens is on the other, extreme end of this spectrum ‚Äì his obsession with achieving perfection and that thing he calls 'dignity' in his profession so strong that it overrides everything else in his life. It therefore seems to be almost an inevitable fact of life that to achieve something, one must sacrifice, either consciously or inadvertently, something else in the process.¬†  

The tragedy of Stevens' situation, however, lies in the fact that all his sacrifices ultimately come to nothing. Miss Kenton goes on to achieve a degree of contentment in her life post her resignation as the housekeeper of Darlington Hall. It is not all roses and rainbows for her but she has things to look forward to, in contrast to Stevens' initial assumption that her marriage has fallen apart and she is unhappy. Presumably things also turn out well for those eloped love birds of whom Stevens has been so critical; and even if they are not leading perfectly happy lives, they can be content with the knowledge that they at least *tried* to pursue happiness instead of running away from it. Stevens, on the other hand, dedicates his whole life to the pursuit of an ideal at the cost of his emotional wellbeing, only to find ‚Äì to take a phrase from Miss Kenton's letter ‚Äì his life stretching out emptily before him.¬† ¬† 

In a way, both Stevens' and Lord Darlington's lives play out in a similar manner. Their commitment to their respective principles only begets loss, regrets and a sense of futility in the end. The difference is, Lord Darlington lives for a cause he believes in, even if it proves to be a misguided one and eventually leads to his downfall. In contrast, Stevens never really lives for himself or something close to his heart. He instead blindly places his trust in his employer and believes that the path to glory lies in playing a part in helping the latter work towards the noble causes of 'justice' and 'the progress of humanity'. One digs his own grave with his own hands, and another digs his own grave by merely deferring to the former. One suffers loss through his doings; another suffers loss through restraint. Neither is desirable, but while Lord Darlington's regrets are a direct consequence of his own actions, Stevens' regrets are borne of *inaction* and therefore cut deeper for him.  

> *'... at least [Lord Darlington] had the privilege of being able to say at the end of his life that he made his own mistakes. [...] He chose a certain path in life, it proved to be a misguided one, but there, he chose it, he can say that at least. As for myself, I cannot even claim that. You see, I* trusted. *I trusted in his lordship's wisdom. All those years I served him, I trusted I was doing something worthwhile. I can't even say I made my own mistakes. Really ‚Äì one has to ask oneself ‚Äì what dignity is there in that?'*¬†  

And perhaps that is what lies at the root of Stevens' regrets: All this time he looked for 'dignity' where it never existed and believed that he was doing something 'worthwhile' in the process. The existential horror lies in this bitter realization. Stevens, however, does pick himself up, and resolves to put the past behind him and throw himself anew into polishing his bantering skills to be employed in the presence of his American employer ‚Äì a matter he has been preoccupied with since the beginning of the book. In a way, it may be argued that instead of learning a lesson, he goes back to square one. But there is a crucial difference here ‚Äì while previously his commitment to his profession was fueled by idealistic notions, now it is a fatalistic choice that he makes after confronting the reality and realizing that there is really nothing else to do other than to keep going.¬†  

> *'The hard reality is, surely, that for the likes of you and me, there is little choice other than to leave our fate, ultimately, in the hands of those great gentlemen at the hub of this world who employ our services. What is the point in worrying oneself too much about what one could or could not have done to control the course one's life took?'*¬† ¬†¬†

And perhaps that is a poignant truth of life in general, and not just that of Stevens: We must latch onto a purpose in order to give meaning to an existence that is inherently meaningless. When one purpose fails or becomes redundant, we must find another one. And, to quote Kurt Vonnegut, so it goes.¬†

16gxk4w,I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how Gone Girl is a ‚Äúfeminist story‚Äù,"Now, I‚Äôm a guy so maybe I‚Äôm missing it, but here is my basic read on the story: a guy puts on a bit of an act to get a girl who‚Äôs out of his league. He loses his money, his mother gets sick, it quickly becomes clear the marriage doesn‚Äôt work, and he has a kind of gross affair with a younger woman. This all makes him a standard bad dude that you feel a little bit of pity for because he‚Äôs had a tough go of it but ultimately you dislike imo. 

Ok but then his girlfriend is literally psychotic and not in a ‚Äúwell he/the patriarchy made her that way‚Äù kind of way. No, it‚Äôs in a ‚Äúshes so crazy, and has always been so crazy, that I‚Äôm now rooting for this mediocre guy because he now looks like a saint in comparison‚Äù way. 

I see isolated feminist moments like the cool girl monologue. But, at least by my reading, the point of this monologue is less that trying to play to male fantasies eventually drives people crazy, and it‚Äôs more a supremely inauthentic person projecting. Amy‚Äôs act didn‚Äôt start because she wanted to appeal to mediocre men; it started with Amazing Amy. She makes a feminist point, but that doesn‚Äôt make this an inherently feminist story. 

Moreover, she fakes being assaulted multiple times and regularly poses as a victim to engender sympathy. The media absolutely trashes Nick for looking insufficiently disappointed his wife is missing and immediately takes her side. If anything, Amy appears to be using her female identity and the ‚Äúdamsel in distress‚Äù implications that come with it to take advantage of and literally kill a man.

Now, I‚Äôve seen some arguments that the very existence of a female villain as unrepentantly evil as Amy is feminist because women are rarely portrayed as so unlikable in media. I could kind of see this, but I don‚Äôt get how the storyline itself is in any way feminist. It just seems to me that it‚Äôs about a sociopathic woman who will use any and all means at her disposal to take control of and destroy someone‚Äôs life. This makes for a very entertaining read and a very compelling character portrait, but idk how this makes a larger statement about feminism. 

I was actually interested in Gone Girl because I had read somewhere that women should use it as a ‚Äúlitmus test‚Äù for their boyfriends. I guess I failed because I utterly fail to see Amy Dunne in any sort of positive light, apart from feeling bad that her husband cheated on her and initially pitying her for being in a loveless marriage. I get the cool girl thing too, but it seems to be a great example of a terrible person having a good idea.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16gxk4w/i_genuinely_dont_understand_how_gone_girl_is_a/,2023-09-12T17:33:10Z,729,2284,books,Gone Girl,POST,Mystery
wgoajp,Gone Girl is a good movie but the book is excellent,"I just finished reading Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and I have to say I really really enjoyed it. I had seen a movie about 2-3 times and I also liked that very much, but I'm really glad that I read a book because some of the things ... made much more sense. Also, this story has a lot of different layers, that never occurred so well in the movie.

For example, Nick's relationship with his father and sister. In the book, there is described well how much his relationship with his father affected him. How he was really afraid that he might end up just like his father.   
And of course his relationship with his sister Margo. When I started reading the book, it definitely seemed to me that he liked his sister much much more than his wife. (For example, giving an explicit description of how her sister looked like, but not much about Amy, etc.) Again, in the movie, I really couldn't see their relationship being so deep. 

And in the end. Nick decides to stay with Amy and play a happy couple. To me, in the movie, it really didn't seem logical at all that he decided to stay after all that crap. But book: after reading everything that happened in both of their heads, you could say they are both awful people. Of course, Amy was an absolute psycho, but Nick wasn't a good man either. Nick had so so many insecurities, and Amy needed constant validation. Like the book said: they really enjoyed themselves most, when they were faking it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wgoajp/gone_girl_is_a_good_movie_but_the_book_is/,2022-08-05T06:44:28Z,265,2938,books,Gone Girl,POST,Mystery

dsg1vg,Gone Girl: I can't believe I skipped over this when I read the book,"As the title says, I've read Gone Girl a year or two ago but I completely skipped over this passage. A lot of people praise the Cool Girl monologue (and with good reason, it's amazing), but *this* is also another absolute gem of that book. It hit me in another way than the monologue, maybe because I've found myself thinking a bit about exactly this lately. 

""For several years, I had been bored. Not a whining, restless child's boredom (although I was not above that) but a dense, blanketing malaise. It seemed to me that there was nothing new to be discovered ever again. Our society was utterly, ruinously derivative (although the word¬†derivative¬†as a criticism is itself derivative). We were the first human beings who would never see anything for the first time. We stare at the wonders of the world, dull-eyed, underwhelmed.¬†Mona Lisa, the Pyramids, the Empire State Building. Jungle animals on attack, ancient icebergs collapsing, volcanoes erupting. I can't recall a single amazing thing I have seen firsthand that I didn't immediately reference to a movie or TV show. A fucking commercial. You know the awful singsong of the blas√©:¬†Seeeen it. I've literally seen it all, and the worst thing, the thing that makes me want to blow my brains out, is: The secondhand experience is always better. The image is crisper, the view is keener, the camera angle and the soundtrack manipulate my emotions in a way reality can't anymore. I don't know that we are actually human at this point, those of us who are like most of us, who grew up with TV and movies and now the Internet. If we are betrayed, we know the words to say; when a loved one dies, we know the words to say. If we want to play the stud or the smart-ass or the fool, we know the words to say. We are all working from the same dog-eared script.

It's a very difficult era in which to be a person, just a real, actual person, instead of a collection of personality traits selected from an endless Automat of characters.¬†

And if all of us are play-acting, there can be no such thing as a soul mate, because we don't have genuine souls.

It had gotten to the point where it seemed like nothing matters, because I'm not a real person and neither is anyone else.

1bhe5t2,Question to those who have read ‚ÄòGone Girl‚Äô,"What do you think the real deal was with Desi? When Amy first reaches out to him for help, she clears up with the reader that she made up all that stuff to Nick and her parents about him being a stalker and his attempting suicide after their breakup. She basically presents him to us as an overly keen simp, but harmless. Then once she moves into his lake house, she supposedly starts to see that he actually is unhealthy obsessed with her and sinister/controlling.

Is this change of events meant to further expose Amy‚Äôs ignorance and over confidence, or is she just an unreliable narrator who planned to kill him from the off, and repaints him this way to justify her actions? I‚Äôm torn between both, because the midway point of the book and getting robbed blind by those two ‚Äòfriends‚Äô of hers at the cabin is basically meant to reframe Amy a bit. That she‚Äôs crazy intelligent and resourceful obviously, but also so sheltered and privileged that she‚Äôs kinda naive and shortsighted in a lot of ways too. So I dunno if her underestimating Desi is another facet of that.

But then Nick‚Äôs reading of the situation seems to be that it was completed calculated and callous on Amy‚Äôs part, and that Desi was completely innocent. And some of what Amy says to him once she returns home after the ‚Äòkidnapping‚Äô kinda verifies this too.

7436xr,"Ignore the movie, read GONE GIRL, by Gillian Flynn.","*I reaize now the title of this review is a little misleading. I am not comparing the book to the movie.  This is a review of the book!*

--

I was never one to read a psychological thriller.  Then‚Ä¶ I read Gone Girl.

Nick and Amy Dunne are auspicious young writers who met, as many writers do, in New York City.  Nick came from a small town known as North Carthage, Missouri to make a name for himself in journalism.  Though born a city girl, Amy held similar aspirations.  Her parents had made a living writing children‚Äôs books featuring Amazing Amy, a character the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Amy has struggled to emulate.  The two writers are a perfect couple with the perfect life: until the recession starts to eliminate their job market.  What‚Äôs more, they learn Nick‚Äôs mother has been diagnosed with cancer.  It only makes sense to move back to Missouri.  In order to make ends meet, Nick decides to open a bar.  Amy contributes the remains of her savings to make this happen but is unable to find work herself.  They are about to celebrate their 5 year anniversary when Amy disappears.  Though Nick is the police‚Äôs prime suspect, his guilt cannot be confirmed.  In fact, it seems very few details regarding Amy‚Äôs disappearance can be confirmed. As various clues and alibis start to contradict each other.  The police struggle to build a coherent case.  The question remains: Where is Amy?  

 

Gone Girl is not necessarily a ‚Äúnew‚Äù release, as the original publishing date was in 2012 and the film adaptation was released in 2014, but I still feel obligated to review (and praise) Gillian Flynn for her work.  As I stated above, I was not typically drawn to her genre but then I was required to read Gone Girl for a critical reading course in college. I was totally sucked in and wrote as much about the book as possible.

 

I promptly bought Flynn‚Äôs other novels: Sharp Objects (2006) and Dark Places (2009) and was happy to find that Gillian Flynn is inventive in all her books.  She writes to achieve rumination rather than resolution and forces readers to challenge their comfortability with principal characters.  There are neither ‚Äúheroes‚Äù nor light-hearted adventures.  To be crystal clear, Flynn writes for a mature audience.  

 

My favorite aspects of Gone Girl is Flynn‚Äôs use of dual and unreliable narration.  These two literary techniques aren‚Äôt always used together, but I do think they work together nicely to prove that multiple perspectives are integral to the plot of a successful thriller novel.  The point of view alternates between Nick and Amy Dunne, who recount events in a manner which protect their self-interests.  As a result, both narrators are unreliable and increasingly unlikeable.  When Amy disappears, Nick is barely fazed. He withholds details regarding his alibi for the morning of Amy‚Äôs disappearance from secondary characters as well as from the reader.  

 

Amy is just as murky in her diary entries.  seems like a caricature of a woman when she writes in her diary.  Her stories from when she and Nick met in NYC  read like a film script. I didn‚Äôt know who to believe or when to take either character seriously (which was great, because I don‚Äôt want predictable characters in a thriller or mystery novel).  This unreliability caused me to start thinking about how secondary characters would tell their version of the ‚ÄúNick and Amy‚Äù story.  For example, how did Amy‚Äôs parents interact with her on a daily basis?  Did they actually expect Amy to use the Amazing Amy series as a literal roadmap to success, or were they simply inspired to write after her mother was finally able to deliver their only daughter?

 

I also enjoyed how Flynn confronts gender stereotypes in this book while keeping the characters realistically problematic.  For example, Amy brings forth an interesting debate on gender expectations by expressing the pressures of being ‚ÄúCool Girl.‚Äù  She explains, ‚ÄúI waited patiently‚Äî years‚Äî for the pendulum to swing the other way, for men to start reading Jane Austen, learn how to knit, pretend to love cosmos, organize scrapbook parties, and make out with each other while we leer. And then we‚Äôd say, Yeah, he‚Äôs a Cool Guy‚Äù (301).  The idea that women should be constantly agreeable while interacting with men is still prominent.  This is why we are still referred to as ‚Äúbossy‚Äù instead of ‚Äúauthoritative‚Äù when we establish ourselves in positions of power.  We are expected to adapt to men‚Äôs tastes and to ‚Äúcalm down.‚Äù To exploit our sexuality. To tolerate inappropriate jokes when we know they‚Äôre offensive and unfunny.  

 

However, women are also taught to look for an unrealistic profile in men, and Amy exhibits this phenomenon.  Though she admits to struggling with gender expectations, she shames Nick for struggling with his identity:  ‚ÄúYou are a man,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúYou are an average, lazy, boring, cowardly, woman-fearing man‚Ä¶The only time in your life you‚Äôve ever liked yourself was pretending to be someone I might like‚Äù (529).  This moment is interesting, as she is chastising Nick for being passive, but also for performing according to her expectations.  Again, I must stress how this novel will make you think about character likeability and complexity.  

 

The only complaint I have about this novel is the very end because the story is uncharacteristically resolved in comparison to Flynn‚Äôs other books.  I can‚Äôt elaborate too much without including spoilers, but I do feel there would be more complications to the resolution when all character perspectives are considered.  This aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I give Flynn a 5-star rating and am eager to see her on the best-seller list again soon!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7436xr/ignore_the_movie_read_gone_girl_by_gillian_flynn/,2017-10-03T20:32:13Z,144,947,books,Gone Girl,POST,Mystery

pm51mp,Gone Girl is a compelling read.,"I expected a fairly mundane book on domestic drama involving cheating, deceit, lies and exaggerated drama. It definitely had all that but also much more. First things first, the story was good. However, Flynn's structure of telling the current story from Nick's perspective and simultaneously adding Amy's perspective through diary flashbacks elevate it to very good. The latter half of the book has 2 points where the plot takes a sudden turn and it remains engrossing till the very end.

Next, the prose and writing style was just what the book needed. It was direct and simple with a touch of edginess through certain vocabulary and references. You get as close you can to the characters as possible. Flynn covers all their feelings and thoughts precisely. The book could have been better edited as Nick's chapters could go for long sometimes, dwelling too much on his thoughts.

Finally, the characters. This is where I have heard criticism on the book. That none of the characters are likable enough. My question is, do they need to be? Further, are the characters all unlikable? Flynn writes her supporting characters well enough to not be cliches. The close sibling who does have her moments of doubt, the genius lawyer who doesn't always have the solution, the tough detective who is more than fair to her prime suspect and the loving parents who love the idea/image of their child as much as the child herself. These characters all feel real and 3 dimensional.

But the story is about Nick and Amy and yes, they aren't exactly role models. Should main characters all be likable for a story to be good? If yes then movies like Joker or shows like Breaking Bad shouldn't work at all. I think a boring, predictable character is worse than a character who is not a good person. Amy is a very interesting character who you just want to know more about. It's hard not to feel for Nick at a certain stage because he doesn't deserve what goes on with him. The punishment is more than what he deserved and that alone makes you sympathetic towards him.
So, the characters too were nicely written. They stay with you for a while.

A special mention to the cool girl monologue which is the most talked about passage from the book. I cannot say how true it is but it does open up your mind and makes you reflect. You use an idea from the book and start pondering about it in real life. To me that makes a book worthwhile.

Couldn‚Äôt Nick prove that Amy went to the hospital to use the sperm? Wouldn‚Äôt that help his case of proving how crazy she was?

12la7w0,Gone Girl 11 years later,"Synopsis: Nicholas Dunne's wife, Amy has gone missing and all the evidence is pointing to him covering up a murder. Each chapter switches back and forth between Nick's current day pov and Amy's diary entries. 

Review: I had heard about the movie in passing 10 years ago but never any details. Read Dark Places a year ago and loved it. 
I devour Gillian Flynn's books; her writing style is captivating and easy to read for me. And her plot twists are enough for me to keep the pages turning. 
After reading this and Dark Places, I'm starting to wonder if Flynn's strength is writing a fucked up and amazing premise but her weak point is endings. Just as I said for Dark Places, I think the over all journey is worth the ride despite what I think is a lack luster ending.
But honestly I think this book makes the moat sense if you read it from the perspective of a cautionary tale: whether it be of a manipulative, gaslighting sociopath, or the personifications of toxic masculinity and femininity or the pitfall of the media's obsession with true crime and how we let media fuel our own actions and behaviors.

s2itrn,"I just finished ""Gone Girl"" by Gillian Flynn - (No Spoilers)","**Gone Girl** by *Gillian Flynn* (no spoilers)

It's impossible to guess what book you're going to fall in love with next. You could read a hundred average books with stark neon covers and stories all hills and peaks. But nothing comes close to picking up a book randomly and thinking: Holy shit! I stumbled onto greatness.

I like to think that the people of the year 1847 felt the same way about Charlotte Bronte as I feel right now about Gillian Flynn. 

My experience with this book has been divine. I don't understand why aren't more people talking about the plot, the massive ""go f\*\*\* yourself"" at the beginning of part two, The cool girl monologue and the style of writing. I wrote notes and notes about my thoughts of this book and I have included it in diaries. Right now, I'm in sort of a recluse from people, taking time off for myself. Comes along this story that -it has been a long time since this happened- took my mind off the world and made me forget I was reading. staring up from the book felt like waking up in the morning. 

I praise a lot of books, mind you. But I can't urge you more to read the story of Amy and Nick. To feel fooled, to fall in love with a character only to fall in love with it again and again. To feel anxious and to be exposed to a character that will help you get rid of that anxiousness.

I love this book.

kjtjej,Gone Girl Review,"¬†Gone girl's premise is set on the disappearance of Nick Dunne's wife Amy Dunne. The police suspect Nick. Amy's friends tell the police that Amy was scared of Nick and kept secrets from him. His computer searches further incriminates him and he also keeps getting calls on his phone.

The fact that this¬† is a dark , twisted psychological thriller is undeniable. The characters are twisted and deeply flawed. The relationships are very dysfunctional and the mystery is gripping. Whether you like it or not,it leaves a deep impact on you .You keep thinking about it . It messes with your brain . The ending is what is truly haunting and it's open to many interpretations. There were many bone-chilling moments that stood out. The character development,the plot and the relationships are bare and honest to a fault . It becomes extremely intense. I personally found it a wild ride and was completely stunned. The ending is the most twisted one you could possibly think and I loved it ! If you are faint of heart , don't pick this up. Your enjoyment is not guaranteed but it will 101% mess up your mind and force you to be on the edge of your seat , rooting for neither of the characters.

vqaqo7,Somehow I confused Gone Girl with a John Green-esk romance novel until I actually read it.,"Holy shit, I am glad I was wrong. 

I must've looked at this cover years ago and thought, ""Oh, another romance novel. Seems cliche and not something I'd be interested in."" I usually stick to sci-fi, YA, fiction, etc. I just finished Michael Crichton's Lost World and Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary. Cut to this year, my husband and I are looking for a movie to watch. Gone Girl pops up as a suggestion, we watch the trailer, and suddenly I'm purchasing Gone Girl, Sharp Objects, and Dark Places as a box set. 

Just finished Gone Girl and I'm completely blown away! The prose is so satisfying- has this 'adult' quality to it. The realist, rational, experienced voice. It took some getting used to Nick's present perspective, and Amy's diary narrative. This leads us to believe that Amy might be dead, since there is no present perspective of Amy. All we have of her is what's written down. Her story fills in the past, Nick is filling in the present. 

So I'm getting the whole picture of these two characters. They both have flaws, but they make each other better. Then there's a shift and they no longer fit together. Okay, sad, but a reality of some marriages. Right when I'm believing that this is a sad story, BOOM. BOMBSHELL. Amy is ALIVE. And goddamn, I also thought, ""Hey, she's not happy in her marriage. Maybe she did just run away, and couldn't see another way out. Maybe she WAS worried about Nick hurting her."" Amy was sharp, conniving, in need of satisfaction from everything around her. The pieces started falling in place- Hillary, Noelle, Desi.. all these stories started to ""make sense"". When Amy decides to come back, and the only way both her and Nick are ""safe"" is to be with each other? Damn, if that's not wicked! 

I left a lot of plot points out, but I was completely stunned by the writing. I like both of these characters. I'm rooting for both Amy and Nick, and want each other to 'win'. What a take on a typical marriage for it's failings and completely surprising me. This book (this author, really) opened my eyes to a new genre I enjoy! Suspense, thriller, a little crime. I'm reading Paula Hawkins' Into the Water next. Then Sharp Objects, Dark Places, and Paula Hawkins' Girl on a Train. 

Any other books in this genre I can read? Because holy cow, I was blown away. Definitely gonna watch the movie this weekend.

2ysjs0,Just finished Gone Girl (Spoilers),"First of all, I want to say I really enjoyed this book. The first part, where you get this contradicting statements from both characters and you don't know who to believe, has to be one of the best written parts of any mistery/thriller books I've ever read. The other two parts aren't as good, but I still think they were good.

Secondly, I read on the forums, that people were enraged by the ending, but I think it couldn't have ended any other way. Amy is a high functioning psychopat, who is one step ahead of everyone at any given moment. The only danger to her comes from Nick, but she breaks him with the pregnancy and Nick's reaction is understandable to me - he knows, if he leaves her, their kid is going to be as screwed up as she is, and god knows what would happen to him (he'd probably turn into his father).

I don't know if the author tried to make the readers sympathize with Nick, but I just couldn't. He's a pathologycal liar, cheting on his wife, instead of being a man and divorcing her. He's a really screwed up character (his parents' fault) and so is Amy (also her parents' fault, no question about that) - so you could say that they, in a sense, deserve each other. 

To me, the most likable character in the book was Go.

I'm off to see the movie now, I hope I'll enjoy it.

5eadpk,What are your thoughts on Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn?,"There were major contraversies about the movie: feminist empowerment or MRA nightmare scenario? Who was in the right Nick or Amy? Who was more relatable to the reader?

There's also the whole ""cool girl"" sterotype:
does it even exist or is it the imagination of a ignorant male?

> Men always say that as the defining compliment, don't they? She's a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she's hosting the world's biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don't mind, I'm the Cool Girl.

>Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they're fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men ‚Äî friends, coworkers, strangers ‚Äî giddy over these awful pretender women, and I'd want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who'd like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I'd want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn't really love chili dogs that much ‚Äî no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They're not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they're pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you're not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn't want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version ‚Äî maybe he's a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he's a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn't ever complain.

ld26xt,Gone girl was ‚Äúmeh‚Äù for me. (Spoilers),"Well, just like the title says, I finished gone girl. After many different close friends telling me that I ‚Äútotally need to read it,‚Äù I gave it a shot. I like suspense. I‚Äôm cool with couples drama, but I had a tough time with a few things. 

The first half of the book didn‚Äôt draw me in anyway other than the classic ‚Äúwhy is girl gone???‚Äù Trope. After hearing the hype from different sources, the reviews, I thought it would draw me more. 

I also felt disappointed by the ending. I didn‚Äôt feel like it concluded the book well. Two people who fucking hate each other, end up starting a family to satisfy (for nick) the media and (for Amy) her sociopathy. I know that things happen, but I wanted to see one or the other see some sort of punishment. Especially Amy.

gls5il,SPOILERS: Gone Girl Plot Holes?,"I just finished rereading Gone Girl (man, it‚Äôs so good). Please do not read this post if you don‚Äôt want to be spoiled for the book! :) 

Anyway, I noticed that when Amy comes back and is talking to the police, she tells them that Desi bashed her head in with the bat from the Judy doll. However, it doesn‚Äôt seem like she faked having a head wound (she faked wrist, ankle, and wounds from being ‚Äúraped‚Äù as well as where she cut herself on her arm with the box cutter, claiming it was Desi that cut her with a knife). I don‚Äôt recall the book mentioning a head wound at all, just bruises on her face I think. Additionally, she claims that Desi beat her with the bat, but wouldn‚Äôt they test it for DNA evidence and find that his DNA wasn‚Äôt on it since that‚Äôs not what actually happened and she intended to frame Nick? Could she have found a way to get Desi‚Äôs fingerprints on it? Another thing is that Nick‚Äôs fingerprints show up on the purse left outside Hannibal (we know she set that up), and later on she claims that Desi must have thrown it out the window. Why wouldn‚Äôt his fingerprints show up? Did these police do no other DNA testing at all?

cuh71s,"Character Study in ""Gone Girl""","So I just finished reading Gillian Flynn's ""Gone Girl."" I was amazed by the author's writing style, the way she could emulate the thoughts of both Nick and Amy's characters... all of Amy's characters.

By the end, however, I was so enthralled. It hit me near the end chapters after Amy's return that I could root for neither character. Nick, the man who had been through one of the most harrowing experiences anyone could go through, nearly executed by the state, only to find out that not only was everything for the past month or so had been a lie, but also so tightly knit that he literally had no escape. His foolishness, whether shock-related or imbued in him via his upbringing, made his decision to stay with Amy so deflating and sad.

Then there's Amy. Amazing Avenging Amy. No one since Annie Wilkes could I ever imagine being so cold, so manipulative, so evil. I truly think she will become (if she hasn't already...) one of the most memorable characters in modern literature. I sit here and try to figure out what makes her so. Is it her psychopathy? Is it that she has literally thought of everything? Is it because she is so duplicitous?

a1iukb,"Just finished ""Gone Girl"" by Gillian Flynn...emotions...<spoilers>","Big spoilers ahead, do not read past this if you haven't read it.  You have been warned.

As the title reads, I just finished Gone Girl and I feel like I have been punched in the guts.  It was such an interesting read that I became emotionally involved and enthralled by the story and characters...then it ended and I sat there seething with rage at how it ended.  I get that the good guys don't always have to win but dammit.  I thought, ""that's it?  She gets win?  All that Nick went through and in the end she gets to get away with it AND get what she wants!?!""

Not only that but he has to go back to playing nice with her parents after they turned their back on him and everyone else who thought he did it?  Jeezus.  I was so sickened by all he had to go through and continue to go through for her.  I wanted justice, I wanted him to get some sort of revenge but she was ahead of him every step of the way.  In the end he just has to take it, all of it...and there isn't a thing he can do about it.

Anyhow, as an avid reader of books I don't get very emotional about many, but this one left me angered and frustrated.

eka3v8,My thoughts on Gillian Flynn's 'Gone Girl',"After reading a handful of mystery fiction, I came across this book. *Gone Girl*. As everyone previously before me stated, the unreliability of both Nick and Amy was a fascinating and distinct characteristic of the novel. I thought the book was neat overall and definitely a little superior than the books that I had previously read. I loved how it focused very heavily on the relationships of the characters and not just on the crime. Throughout the book, I noticed that I genuinely hated both Amy and Nick. This has never happened to me. I have never in the past **hated** a character. Both of them had their own facades and it sometimes made it very difficult to understand their point of views. But I then realized that the author was most likely doing her job if she could entice such an emotion from her readers. The overall structure of the book was pretty great. This is not the first time I have read a book that featured alternating perspectives. However, the use of diaries, symbols of intimate thoughts, to manipulate the reader was a genius tool utilized by Flynn. For a significant chunk of the book, I was trusting everything that Nick and Amy were writing just because they were **writing in a diary**. I also loved how the book displayed that we as people not only lie to others, but also ourselves. It also depicted how we are all wrong and right according to different perspectives. Nick and Amy can both be seen as wrong or right if judged through different lenses. 

The only criticism that I have of the book was its lack of 'shock value.' I think because the book began to display the 'back-end mechanism' of how Amy carried out her plan in the **middle** of the plot as well as the heavy emphasis on the relationships of the characters, the effect of the overall 'shock' lessened. But it was an interesting move regardless. Most books shower the reader with bits and pieces of the mystery and then reveal the entire thing in the end; *Gone Girl* does not. The end surprise is very pleasing and significant to me when I read mysteries, so I was expecting the same in this novel. However, the focus on complex relationships as well as symbolism made things work for the most part.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/eka3v8/my_thoughts_on_gillian_flynns_gone_girl/,2020-01-05T07:56:45Z,2,9,books,Gone Girl,POST,Mystery

8m8zz0,"Oh ""Gone Girl"" how you have spoiled me. (No spoilers)","While Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn is not my favorite book by any stretch of the imagination. It has done a few things that no other book including my favorite books have done. For starters this was the first and only book that I did not want to stop reading at all. Every time I did put it down all I could do was think of where the story was going next and I couldn't wait to pick it up again. The way the book is written from two different people perspectives at the same time is genius and for the first time the end of every chapter genuinely felt like a cliffhanger. Having to read through a whole chapter just to go back and find out where the cliffhanger would lead time and time again made it almost impossible to stop reading. It was the first and only time again that I found myself wanting to skip chapters to find out what happened next.

Now there's a reason why this isn't my favorite book. Some of you might agree with me, I think a lot of you will without spoiling anything the end of fucking sickening! But that's just another reason why I love this book and it was another first and only. This is the first and only time that a book has made me physically upset. When I finished the book I hated it. It made my blood boil and I sat for far too long contemplating it. 

And this is why I feel like Gone Girl has spoiled me. No other book has done all these things to me. I've read better stories with better characters by better authors.

I suppose I find the prose in itself to be enjoyable; however, every time I read a nice piece of prose and I want to follow it, it seems to be followed by an unnecessary sentence that feels like running into a brick wall. 

Maybe it's just the constant feeling of starting and stopping with no flow?

2yht1i,Is reading Gone Girl after watching the film worth it?,"I love love loved the film, but I'm unsure if i would enjoy reading the novel now.  It seems like the story really depends on the unexpected twists and turns of the plot - so I'm concerned if most of the plot points are the same, the book may not be enjoyable because it wouldn't have the sense of anticipation it should.

I'm also interested in how the characters are different in the two versions.  Are they more fleshed out in the book?  Are character interactions a big focus of the book?

I'm also concerned with themes.  Now obviously both versions will share the main themes, but I find a lot of the time movie-adaptations focus on just a few of the themes found in the book, simply because they don't have the time in the film format to really address all the themes properly.  That also results in entire characters and subplots being dropped or merged.  This is a bit more plot-concerned, but what I'm asking here I suppose is does the book deal with more themes than the movie?

One last thing, what is the quality of prose like?  I've heard enough praise to guess that it's not on the Dan Brown side of things (although I do enjoy the Langdon series but I read them before I saw the movies) or is there some really merit in it?  Could the prose make me see the story in a different way than the film, which I thought set the perfect tone?

**TLDR:** Since I know the main plot, are the main characters, minor characters/subplots dropped from the film, and quality of prose worth reading the book?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2yht1i/is_reading_gone_girl_after_watching_the_film/,2015-03-09T22:45:58Z,12,2,books,Gone Girl,POST,Mystery

1kdwhp,The ending to Gone Girl [Spoilers],"I‚Äôll come right out and say it: I hated the ending to Flynn‚Äôs thriller more than I hated the ending to the Hunger Games trilogy. The third part of the book was rushed through and then left with almost nothing of consequence resolved ( ([Spoiler](/s ""except Nick not going to jail"") ). It‚Äôs rather sad because I loved the book; it was a page turner from the very beginning, just what I was looking for in a summer thriller. Unfortunately the ending left me wishing I had never downloaded it. 

[Spoiler](/s ""I absolutely cannot believe that Nick would choose to stay with Amy simply because he wants a child. It‚Äôs clear after Amy returns that he fears for his life (never turn your back on her), well what about his Child‚Äôs life? Are we left to believe that Boney will just let a cold blooded murderer walk free? Or that Go will let Amy lay in bed next to Nick while her niece is down the hall? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm fine with the narrative of Amy getting away with it, I don‚Äôt need justice. I just find it completely implausible that Nick goes from outrage/hatred/fear to just feeling sorry for her all because he wants a child. I get it, he‚Äôs almost as fucked up as she is but I still can‚Äôt fathom how Nick finds it in himself to sleep next to a woman that slit the throat of a man while he was sleeping. To me, there was no indication in the book that he would be okay with that just because he wanted a kid."") 

Anyways, just wanted to vent about how farfetched the ending seemed to me. What do you guys think?

2n3jxm,[SPOILERS] Striking similarities between Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl and Jean Giono's Les √Çmes Fortes,"Both books share A LOT. Here are some points:

-Narration unreliability: Different narrators, contradictions between them, eventual revelations.

-Structure of plot twists: First naive narration of the events (Amy/Nick Th√©r√®se/Firmin perfect lovely couple struggling in a tough economic climate), then a more realist one (when Nick Dunn reveals his adultery, when Firmin is revealed to beat his wife) and eventually the gloomy truth (the female characters are evil)

-Characters lie to each other and the reader throughout both books.

-The gullibility, naiveness of public opinion, its eagerness to be easily manipulated.

-Lies, treasons, and ruthless domination in the marriage.

-Judgmental society based on conformism, gossips aand hypocrisis, where apparences (btw the french title of Gone Girl is ""Les Apparences"") are to be saved at any cost.
In this harsh society shaped by men, women can't dispose of their own existence (theme of the cool girl, need to be married to have a social status). 

-Sociopathy of the main female character. Its ability to appear like an angel in public opinion's viewpoint while being a devil.
Therese and Amy have learned to hate with a smile. They are both cold manipulative megalomaniacs who despise the human kind. Wanting to get back at this pathetic society, their life goal is to deceive everyone into thinking they are poor innocent good souls.

-Underlying theme: The blackness of human soul and the triumph of evil.

There's one story where a girl has a crush on her teacher and 'falls in love with him'...and he reciprocates. He even kisses her. Nothing happens to the teacher when it's found out, either. Hell, the girl is even blamed! 
This thread of adults abusing, misusing or neglecting their power over children runs quite a bit in her stories. Of course, there's good adults, but when they're bad, they're *bad*.

6c4idi,"Finished reading my first book for pleasure, ""Gone"" by Michael Grant. Discussion? (spoilers?)","I was assigned books to read in high school and college, but only ever read enough to pass a test. I've never been much of a read. I just wanted to try something new, so I went the bookstore and bought this book. I'm not exactly sure how to elicit discussion, so here's what I'm thinking as I finished the book. Note, this is the first book I've finished, so some of these thoughts might be shallow, but they're new to me.

When I picked up Gone, I don't know what I was expecting. I didn't know I would care so much about characters in a book. In the book, when Sam/Quinn became separated from Astrid/L.P. (when L.P. teleport them away), I didn't know I would be upset with them. It's a strange feeling, but when something good happened to them, I felt good. When the characters found out something disturbing, I was disturbed. I don't know if I just happened to pick a really good first book, but Gone drew me in and made me feel like I was experiencing things with the characters.

About the book more specifically, and less about the experience: 

I don't want to be critical, because this *is* the first book of a series, so things might become explained better as the series moves on. But I'm very confused on how Sam learns to control his Green-Light power throughout the first book. At first it was driven by fear (of his step-father, the fire-girl attacking him). Then it became controlled by anger? More specifically anger towards his mom? The beginning of the book was filled with happy memories Sam had with his mother; he would come home from school while she was getting up for work and they would talk on the front porch. So where did the anger come from? My only assumption is that his anger towards her came from not being told he was a twin, which could be all the anger he needed. If that was the only source of tension between him and his mother, maybe I didn't stop/slow down enough to grasp how deep that tension was.

Something I loved about the book was how Lana's character developed. She seemed to have a completely different experience than everyone else that was focused on. Everyone (Astrid, Sam, Quinn, Caine, Drake, bullies) all had people around them to comprehend everything that was changing. Meanwhile, Lana laid in the desert half-dead, realized she could heal a visibly broken arm, talked to some coyotes, found darkness, and learned about everything herself. I guess what I liked the most about Lana was how her defiance kept her alive with the Coyotes. She realized she could out-smart them, and did. I think she grew so much as a character, and I think I understand her more than anyone else in the story because of it.

Side note about Lana. IIRC Lana was stealing beer for a guy named Tony. Then it was revealed Cookie (the bully who was injured by Caine in the church with the flying cross) was revealed to actually be named Tony. But when Lana healed Tony, they didn't seem to have any extraordinary relationship. Did I get something wrong or miss something? I guess more than 1 person can be named Tony. But still, I was waiting for so long for her to be able to heal him, and then nothing happened.

I could really go on and on about this book. Like I said, I never knew I could care so much about the characters. I feel like I could write a paragraph about each person. But I'll leave this as it is. I don't really have any specific question! If anyone read this far and read the book, please comment your favorite part, least favorite part, what you thought, anything. I'd love to share some discussion about this book before I go and pick up the second book.

11riloq,The Secret History by Donna Tartt,"It's like Donna Tartt is that ex you can't get over. She showed me this beautiful story and then just left me in a mess out on the streets. Can't seem to fill the void. I've read her other novel The Goldfinch after that. But I feel like nothing comes close to the writing, characters, and scenery like it does in The Secret History. When Richard was cold, I was cold. When Richard was confused, I was confused. I even miss Bunny's questionable chaotic actions. The story lives rent free in my head. I keep searching for something similar everytime I pick up a new book, it's kinda sad honestly. 
Did you guys feel this too?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11riloq/the_secret_history_by_donna_tartt/,2023-03-15T01:57:52Z,341,1906,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
quetzv,The Secret History by Donna Tartt was truly an experience,"The book was about 600 pages long but I honestly did not want it to end! Donna Tartt has such a way with words that her prose has left such a big impression on me. Even her describing foliage and environment was beautiful, like each word was carefully picked to hold up a sentence. I completely get why people say her book feels like reading a classic with the way her prose is written (can't properly describe it in words, but having read classics for this month I get why people have said this). I loved the timeless feel that this book really gave off. 

Some scenes are so vivid such as the winter part where I almost felt the same isolation that Richard felt, as well has the tension, that something bad might happen anytime during the second half of the book after the murder. Is this book realistic? I don't think so, but the way Tartt writes makes it so real for the reader and I really felt I was transported in the same place as the characters. 

I know some did not like the characters, but it honestly did not matter to me that they are unlikable? You see through Richard's POV and he never really saw them otherwise until near the end when he got out of his head for a bit. When you truly step back, all the characters are to some degree horrible humans and what they do is horrible, but like Richard said, this is his fatal flaw, and once you step back from this book do you really see that for what it is. 

The book is a murder 'mystery' but the whole murder was laid out in the prologue, so much of the book is about asking 'why' it happened, with Richard only asking himself that near the end. I thought the Epilogue ended right as it should. Although not a good person, I find Henry to be quite a memorable character and I think it really leaves you something to think about. 

What are your thoughts on this book? Any similar book suggestions after this? (I might check out the Goldfinch sometime).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/quetzv/the_secret_history_by_donna_tartt_was_truly_an/,2021-11-15T11:59:28Z,322,1929,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
19461q4,Just finished reading The Secret History.,"The book could be best described by the word ""discomfort"". Throughout the entirety of the book, there wasn't a single moment where I could truly feel ""safe"". Even in the sequences where Camilla and Julian are the main focus, it gave off an impression that Richard was overromanticizing them, that his perception couldnt have been the reality even if we wanted to believe it. (He even admits it himself by the end.) 

Richard is one of my favorite narrators of all time. He is a liar and an accessory to murder. However, one simply can't help but sympathize with his action as this ""sacred"" group is the only place where he could feel like he belongs. 

On the other hand, the endless description of alcohol and cigarettes impressed (but also somewhat annoyed) me at first. However, as the story continued on, they began to feel like a reminder of the terrible fates these beloved characters will face. Poor Charles. I was sure he was going to poison himself to death.

The ending. (My god, the ending.) Each character deserved what came upon them. Richard, especially. It's sort of fitting for him to be in a continuous state of discomfort and need for belonging after all that happened.

Anyways, I love this book and I have nowhere to rant my appreciation for it so I'd like to thank whoever is reading this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/19461q4/just_finished_reading_the_secret_history/,2024-01-11T16:42:48Z,82,188,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
16of8l6,The Secret History weirded me out.,"I think I get it? 

The thing is, I haven't had any spoilers except the names of characters. I didn't know there WERE murders. And the aesthetics of it...I don't know. I haven't felt much in the aesthetics department.

It's a good book. Everybody has different opinion about everybody and all of them are wrong. I plainly ache for everybody. Not so much for Bunny, though. With an alarmingly fond opinion of Henry, I almost saw sence in his arguments. I might be just depressed and hateful. 

I think, what had flipped me over is that fact that everything that happens is more or less believable. My poor lonely heart cracked at Charles & Camilla. That nice little fantasy of twins that are close, each others best friends turned out to be so sad and almost sinister. I don't think she would ever recover. I was more than happy about her and Henry, but I think she most have come secondary in Henry's love, even though Richard points out how Henry's behaviour towards Camilla differs from his behavour with others. 

Poor, poor Francis. I get it's the 80s, but oh my god. I know fans must have given him a happy ending with Richard or Charles, but oh my god. The whole book doesn't give out the times all that much. 

Overall, It's good. I think I get the point and the hype. Nobody really came out fine. Or well. Even a little bit happy. I guess, you can count me in too. It might be two-three shitty days I had, but the end made me sad. 

I got another author to read and marvel sadly at what is happening. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16of8l6/the_secret_history_weirded_me_out/,2023-09-21T12:56:20Z,99,200,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
15b2wi1,I adored The Secret History,"Just finished it and HOLY SHIT! This book was an incredible experience from beginning to end. The characters and plot were just ü§å. 

Throughout it, I found myself connecting with Richard quite a lot with his actions and feelings towards all the weirdness around him being something I could do, as well. The other Greek students I found to be arrogant assholes (especially Bunny) yet they‚Äôre also some of the most charming characters that I still cared about up until the final page. Even the side characters that appeared for a couple of pages were pretty memorable and likable in their own unique ways such as Judy Poovey‚Äôs chill attitude and Cloke‚Äôs knowledge of drugs. I especially loved how everyone outside of Julian‚Äôs class got a good ending in the epilogue.

The beginning of the book I found to be slow at times but when the truth of the strangeness gets revealed it makes everything before it worth it. Same goes for the second half. Some of my favorite scenes are probably Richard‚Äôs winter in Hampden for how accurate its descriptions of cold are and meeting the rest of Bunny‚Äôs family with their chaotic energy. Not to mention the writing is just so beautiful and descriptive at times. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to read a book like this for quite a while.

He said that Camilla and Richard were serious about their future together. !<

>!I completely disagree? I never got the sense that she was into Richard, perhaps interested but nothing serious at all. She was leading him on and Richard was never really her main option to begin with. Maybe she was a bit interested in him but she rarely initiated much with Richard and left him in the dark for much of the book. But his interest in her was surely amusing to Camilla. !<

15ljoqc,What am I missing in the secret history??,"I just finished the book this morning and I just can‚Äôt understand why I wasn‚Äôt a fan. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of any of the characters but I understand that was probably intentional on her part. But I also didn‚Äôt really like how she threw in supernatural aspects (edit: more so hinted at them) and then didn‚Äôt really do much with them? And what did the guy who fixes henry‚Äôs car really have to do with anything?

I thought Julian was going to be a much bigger part of the book but after the beginning we didn‚Äôt really hear anything about him. But apparently this pretentious teacher made such an impact that Richard considers him to be a father figure? 

Why is the school okay with a professor only teaching 6 students that he hand selects?? I just had so many  questions throughout the book that it took away from the experience a lot. I know Richard is supposed to be this passive guy who goes with the flow but after awhile I got sick of him having no real opinions or identity of his own (which again I understand is the point) but I just found it too unrealistic to have any actual meaning. 

I‚Äôm definitely in the minority here and wish I liked this book as much as other people! Will I like the Goldfinch any better? She‚Äôs clearly a good writer but I just didn‚Äôt like the story or characters of the secret history at all

Edit: I was also so curious about the background of how all the other characters (besides richard) initially became such a closed-off group of friends, and how Julian seemed to encourage it. I kept hoping to learn more about the other characters thoughts and motivations (especially Camilla) but other than henry and richard I still really don‚Äôt know anything about them. 

And if the group had always disliked bunny from the start (I did too) why were they all such good friends with him? Why tolerate all the racism and bigotry and horrible things he said and then blame it on him going through some sort of breakdown that she never further explains? I just couldn‚Äôt get into the mindset that anything about the characters was believable or useful or even interesting 

I guess I just didn‚Äôt fall into the atmosphere and vibes as much as others. Still wanna give her other books a chance though

This book isn‚Äôt like TSH in the way that it‚Äôs in a school background or really dark academia, at least in the classic sense, but it‚Äôs dark and page-turning and very intricate, and also is a bit of mystery/thriller in a way but way more so literary fiction. 

I knew ‚ÄúThe Historian‚Äù was going to be one of my new favorite books before I was even 1/3 of the way done. First of all, the plot is very interesting the entire thing is like an odyssey of two different journeys that intertwine. I‚Äôm usually not into that style of plot but this was executed so well.

The main character is so lovable and relatable and probably one of my favorite narrators I‚Äôve ever read. Writing itself is superb, some of the lines in this book REALLY knocked me away and I‚Äôm a pretty big reader.

15wqbh5,Foreshadowing in the Secret History,"Not sure how many people here have read the Secret History by Donna Tartt, but it‚Äôs my third reread of the book and I just came across a very intriguing detail early on that absolutely explains later events in the book. 

Now correct me if I‚Äôm mistaken‚Äî I‚Äôve only read the book in all its entirety once‚Äî but from what I remember, Julian abandons the group once he‚Äôs learned what they‚Äôve done to Bunny.

But on page 28, in the first full conversation Richard has with him, he states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid my students are never very interesting to me because I always know exactly what they‚Äôre going to do.‚Äù

Once I read this line, something told me that it said a lot more than what was being let on. Then it clicked.

Once Julian learns that his group of students were responsible for murdering another amongst them, he gets scared off. Not because of how horrible the actual act was though; he flees because it means he‚Äôs not as in control, or in the know about everyone around him (who, from that first conversation, you can also gather he considers beneath him, ‚ÄúThe country people who live around me are fascinating because their lives are so closely bound to fate that they really are predestined.‚Äù) as he thinks he is.

Therefore, he takes off for the selfish reason that he wasn‚Äôt able to predict what his students would do, that the ‚Äúrug‚Äù was somehow taken out from underneath him. Basically, it was a blow to his own ego.

UPDATE: I‚Äôm falling down the rabbit hole when it comes to Julian in this comment section.

Specifically, Henry‚Äôs suicide. I‚Äôm inclined to interpret it as him choosing an ‚Äú aesthetic‚Äù way out, rather than doing it to save his friends or become a martyr. I think he is far too selfish for that. Rather, I think he knew his life in his fantasy world was coming to an end, and saw this as the only alternative to being forced to live in the modern world. The departure of Julian, the dissolution of the Greek program, and the shattering of the groups bond made it clear that things would never be the same again, and their sanctuary away from the modern world was gone.

the biggest thing of course, is the ending‚Äî
what did henry mean with 'having troubles with my passport', was the destroyed, decayed city and the futuristic street a symbol for henry being stuck in limbo, sort of between old and new?

not to mention, the night of the bacchanal, they all mentioned being in a dream-like state where they could not explain what exactly they felt.
ever since then, i feel like this reoccurring leitmotiv of 'dream' has played a significant role.
after bunny's death, charles (or francis, I don't remember exactly) mention that he's seen richard in his dream, it is never picked up again afterwards.

and in the end, when richard sees the ghost of henry, or when he sees him in h i s dream, saying 'i thought you were dead', does it mean that he was connected to them in some way?
considering just like they did for the rituals, richard also did go days without food due to the group's sudden change of plans etc.

id love to hear someone's opinion, this book is messing with my head.
im pretty sure many many things are of importance and play into it that *i* don't get because my knowledge of mythology and rituals is very limited!

ikhuiq,Donna Tartt's The Secret History,"I read The Secret History when I was about 17. It's been 17 years since (I'm 34) and I still think about it all the time. I found her prose almost addictive in a way I have only really felt in 11/22/63, Tolstoy and Steinbeck.

I had a modest upbringing in rural NZ but I felt I could relate to this elite University crowd in New England. The main character fits into a rich friendship group and has to keep up appearances kind of like Harry Potter at Hogwarts, a feeling I think everyone can understand.

I loved the blurred lines between the events and the supernatural, at points I found it hard to tell what was real and what was imaginary. I don't like unreliable narrators but I enjoyed it in this book.

I was disgusted with myself (again- in the best way) when I realized I had been tricked by Henry. I was so distracted by the fact that he saved Richards life that I labeled him as a good person and overlooked all of his red flags. I thought, he must have everyone‚Äôs best interests at heart so they should all listen to him. Wow. When Bunny told Richard about the murder I was so happy that Richard told Henry, but as I continued to read I couldn‚Äôt believe I ever thought that way. There is no way Bunny was as bad as Richard portrayed him. 

I loved the journey from adoring the characters in the beginning of the story to being unable to stand them. They truly are awful, but it took me so long to notice.

However, we've both already purchased The Basic Eight by Daniel Handler (before reading The Secret History haha) for our mini two person book club, so we're deciding to plow on.

My question is, for people who've read both books, how similar are they? Is TBE enjoyable if I were to go into it expecting A Series of Unfortunate Events written for adults? I know every dark academia book under the sun is inevitably compared to TSH, so I feel a bit dejected we've finished the ""peak"" of this genre.

183bqgg,I can't read The Secret History by Dona Tartt anymore,"This book was featured on many a book recommendations list I had come across. Its title piqued my interest quite a bit. 'Secret history' promised an experience with mystery and intrigue, features that render a book appealing to me. Not knowing much about what it was about I made the decision of giving it a go.

However, having reached the 70% mark I've concluded that to take this book for even a second more is not possible for me. Its just so god damn boring. The story could have been taken in so many interesting directions.

The potential was there but basically nothing of much excitement and engagement happens in the narrative as it unfolds. 

The pages revolve around the mundane, day to day or moment to moment happenings and interactions between characters that tend to have little to no bearing to the main plot of this book. 

Now if that particular element is present to a reasonable extent in a story to lend it some texture, imbue a sense that its characters behave in a manner that is - and therefore are - more human-like then it doesn't feel bothersome. 

But here for whatever reason you found overabundance of it. It became tedious and torturous.

The only good thing I can say about this book is that at times, given how its sentences are written, it feels good to read. The command of the English language of the author can most certainly never be brought to question.

But in terms of the power of its story to captivate, enthrall and satisfy it resoundingly failed in my estimation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/183bqgg/i_cant_read_the_secret_history_by_dona_tartt/,2023-11-25T04:43:11Z,23,0,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

But I‚Äôve been in a reading slump for a while, the last time I read the book, around February 26, I got to the part where Bunny is confronting Richard about the school he went to, which is a couple of pages before where I‚Äôm now. The thing is I‚Äôm struggling to keep reading as it‚Äôs a bit slow/kinda forgot a bit during my slump, it‚Äôs still a very great book, i have enjoyed reading it, but don‚Äôt know how to motivate me to regain energy in reading the book.

uok4aj,"Just finished The Secret History (Donna Tartt). Great read, but...","I loathed almost the entire cast list. What a bunch of vain, pompous, preening, shallow, arrogant, pretentious insufferable, effete grandiloquents.

It's a really great book which I truly enjoyed but I can't recall ever before reading a novel I enjoyed so much where I didn't hold even the slightest crumb of warm feeling for *any* of the characters. I think the only character of importance I didn't actively dislike was the murdered farmer.

I'm most definitely *not* saying they are badly *written* characters as they are superbly drawn. I'm just glad those who died, died (except poor sacrificial Mr Farmer) and those who didn't are always going to be miserable. Except they're so vainglorious they'd love the thought of suffering through a Greek tragedy of a life as they'd think it gave them depth and pathos as they languish in their self-made but tastefully furnished prisons.

Awful people, just awful. Well done Donna Tartt.

17c82lg,The Secret History Vs If We Were Villians,"The Secret History by Donna Tartt and If We Were Villians by M. L. Rio

 - NO SPOILERS  -  none in comments as well, please.

I always have people recommending If We Were Villians since I've read The Secret History, I've been meaning to read it but haven't found the time. Anyway, I want to know why. Why do people seem to connect the two? What are the similarities and differences? Is it because they give off the same vibe? Like I just want to know why people always pair them up.

Now, I don't want this to be taken to offense or be considered rude: but which is better? I most likely will read IWWV so I i guess ill be the judge of that at one point, but just for now, I want to hear your opinions.

Donna Tartt is a well-known author by most book lovers, she has amazing books with incredible plots. M. L. Rio appears to be a new writer that not many have ever heard of until her release of I We Were Villians. It's strange to me that even despite their differences these two books are always being compared and contrasted, especially since The Secret History is a classic.

Is IWWV a 'modernized' version of TSH? I know they do not share the same plot, but I have noticed that the new generation prefers these more modern content-related novels and since they apparently give off similar vibes is that why they are often paired? I have no idea what the content of IWWV is like so I could be completely wrong. To someone who has read both: do you think they are written at the same level? maturity-wise, content-wise, language-wise? Help me out here.

To be honest, I'm not sure what I'm asking. But I hope you understand why I want *answers*?

I want this to be a place of discussion about the two books; whether that compares them, reveals opinions of them, reviews/rates them, or is even just a general statement of what the two are about.

Yes, I'm aware that this is quite a broad question to ask.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17c82lg/the_secret_history_vs_if_we_were_villians/,2023-10-20T10:30:39Z,14,7,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
10ymnen,"The Secret History, a theory","Henry's original plan was to pin Bunny's death on Richard. That's the theory anyway.

Because I don't see a lot of good reasons for Henry to tell Richard everything from the farmer's murder to his plan with the mushrooms. By going out of his way to include Richard in the lead up to Bunny's murder, Henry makes Richard complicit. It's especially strange when you consider that Henry is not the blabby type. He managed to keep the secret of the Bacchanal quite well, and yet when it came to the murder(s), he just can't stop talking. Why? 

I tend to think Francis was in on it with Henry to pin the thing on Richard or maybe Charles or maybe Judy Poovey if the opportunity arose. My feeling is that Francis was the only one out of the entire Greek class who Henry did not regard as a pawn or a tool because he, like Henry, had a huge solid trust fund. It's clear to me that while Henry regards 99.999% of the human population as impossibly beneath him, he does have real respect for money and status. If Henry has any loyalty, it is to people of his own class, like Francis and Julian. 

Out of the entire group, Charles is the only remotely trustworthy one, and he too suspected Henry was going to make him the fall guy. I believe him. 

My other reason for thinking Henry (and perhaps Francis) was setting Richard up to be the fall guy is because of the obvious and numerous references to film noir: the imagery with the cigarettes, the darkness lit by a single lamp with the walls converging in on the narrator, the Raymond Chandler book Richard reads to fall asleep to, the Hitchcock movie Bunny and Richard watches the night the farmer dies, etc. 

I feel like this is worth mentioning because one common theme in film noir is that of the ordinary guy who goes running after glamour and excitement and ends up in a nightmare world where he is accused of a crime he knows he did not commit. Richard has committed no crimes, and he had come within a hairbreadth of saving Bunny's life. But by the time Bunny dies, Richard is as knee deep in everything as anybody else in Greek class. And the reason why is simple: it was because Henry planned it that way.

Also, on a previous comment on The Secret History, I wrote a lot of shit about what a turd Julian is. After some pondering though, I've arrived at an entirely different conclusion on Julian: he wasn't so bad! He really cared about Bunny as evidenced by him inviting Richard to lunch just so he could ask him about Bunny. He accepted Richard into his class even though it must have been abundantly clear Richard was only an impostor. I think his abandonment of the Greek class after the revelation may be more due to grief and shattered illusions than simple cowardice.

Doing the right thing so far as Julian is concerned would have involved some form of going to the authorities. This obviously would destroy Richard, who would be left to face the legal music alone being neither well connected (like the twins) nor wealthy (like Henry and Francis). 

Otoh, acting as if nothing had happened is just as impossible if Julian really believed Bunny died at the hand of his own best friends. To kill a friend is the worst form of disloyalty, and it signifies not just moral corruption but of emptiness, a vacuousness that is symbolic of the everything that is detestable about the modern age. The ancients were all about honor (a man's word blah blah, a woman's chastity blah blah), the moderns about literal nothingness. In the Greek class Julian thought he found his disciples. But instead of honor and virtue, what he realized he had was four kids who would murder a classmate to avoid facing up to another murder, and a fifth kid who tagged along just because.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10ymnen/the_secret_history_a_theory/,2023-02-10T09:30:36Z,21,49,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
kfd5a8,"""The Secret History""... Why do people like this","Just finished reading ""The Secret History"" today by Donna Tartt.

Well... Kind of finished. About halfway through i had to start skimming, sometimes reading only the first few words of each paragraph. 

Dude. This book.... Is SO. BORING. The only way i can fathom people actually liking it is if they're as pretentious as this author clearly was upon the time of writing.

I will give it kudos for stylish, and at times beautiful writing. But that's about it.

It starts out interesting enough. No spoilers here, but the introduction to our cast of characters has boundless potential that really could have gone anywhere.

Instead, it covers some mysterious, treacherous territory.... Then stops. And utterly stagnates around 40% of the way through. What remains is a half-baked mish mash of college drama and angst from a group of twenty somethings that all seem capable of nothing but becoming increasingly unlikable as the story (can you even call it that?) progresses.

I knew things were turning sour when, after each new, forgettable little plot point or character fault was revealed, i found myself thinking ""who fucking cares?""

In her opening pages, the author partially dedicates the novel to Brett Easton Ellis.

16fvdu7,The Secret History by Donna Tartt: Theories,"I‚Äôm currently re-reading Donna Tartt‚Äôs The Secret History right now and I have several theories but no one to share them with, so I thought I would put them here to see what you all think!

&#x200B;

 

&#x200B;

**1** 

Richard pushed Bunny. 
&#x200B;

Richard said he hates authors who skip over the grisly parts of their crimes out of shame/embarrassment/guilt but he does it.   
&#x200B;

He was not only involved in the planning of Bunny‚Äôs murder but encouraged it by telling Henry what Bunny told him about the farmers murder knowing that Henry was already thinking about killing him.   
&#x200B;

While he showed some guilt about the murder afterwards he had no qualms about going through with it and was involved in the planning of it every step of the way.  
&#x200B;

He had a vested interest in Bunny dying not just to help protect the group but because Bunny knew/implied he knew about Richard‚Äôs true background and that he was lying about having money. He would have wanted to keep his secrets. He also wanted to secure his place in the group and what better way to do so than to kill someone.  
&#x200B;

We don‚Äôt know how Bunny died, as Richard purposely skips over this information. The only thing we do know is that Henry walked towards him, Camilla checked to make sure Bunny was dead. But what exactly did Richard do? If Richard didn‚Äôt kill Bunny why wouldn‚Äôt he tell us how Bunny died?  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**2** 

Julian was more involved than Richard either was aware or wanted to admit. 

I think he was the person Camilla remembered seeing at the Bacchanal. He and Henry had spoken before the Bacchanal and Julian had told him to do what was necessary.   
&#x200B;

Henry got the idea to do the Bacchanal from Julian. Henry and Francis both were interested in acquiring the land with Francis wanting to purchase the house and Henry finding the land sacred. Henry is implied to have spent more time with Julian than the others having been to his home and had private conversations. 
&#x200B;

He also calls Bunny by his nickname for the first time when it came to Bunny‚Äôs suicide note which was odd. He said he knew or was able to predict what his students were doing and with how close he was to Henry there‚Äôs no way he didn‚Äôt know what they were up to. Which is probably why he had to leave and did leave so quickly.   

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**3** 

Richard was the author of Bunny‚Äôs suicide note as a confession. He spent a lot of time with Bunny and with Henry. He could have gotten the paper from either of them. The typewriter was in the study room for anyone to use. 
&#x200B;

Richard was an excellent student and could have written the note convincingly enough to sound like Bunny. It gives him the perfect out in the murder of the farmer because he‚Äôs not named once in them and it implicates the group especially Henry. Which could be Richards payback against Henry implicating him to the FBI. Also it‚Äôs the only way for Richard to confess just like he is confessing to us with the book for his guilt without having to actually atone for anything.   
&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Richard also flip flops between insisting that Bunny was the author to it being possibly someone else. We also don‚Äôt know when the letter was dropped off because Julian doesn‚Äôt mention it. But from the way he was acting when he spoke to Richard and Francis and why he initially took it as a joke/brushed it off before speaking with Henry one could infer it was delivered after Bunny‚Äôs death.   

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**4** 

Charles is the only other person who could have written the note because he was also close to Bunny and Richard notes he is an expert forger and the letter is one big middle finger to Henry and the only other person who had a reason to hate/implicate Henry as revenge besides Richard would be Charles.  
&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**5** 

Francis is a predator who was possibly abusing Charles and no one in the group seemed to care. He also tried to have sex/ SA Richard and foreshadowed doing it when he said ‚Äúif you drank as much as he(Charles) does, I daresay I would have been in bed with you, too.‚Äù   
&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**6** 
A catamount killed the farmer, Henry lied about it so he could manipulate the group and to murder bunny. 

&#x200B;

There‚Äôs several hints about it being a big cat from Charles bite, to the way the body was found I mean how on earth did they rip open the stomach of a grown man and mutilate him without any weapons? They even go the catamount inn. 
&#x200B;

There would be something so deliciously ironic and really fulfill the themes of it being a Greek tragedy if it had all been a wild animal and Bunny was killed for nothing.   
&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**7**  

I think Richard was there at the Bacchanal and it was one of the many things he omitted. 

He is a self professed liar, an excellent one at that. He has no problem going where he‚Äôs not supposed to as we saw him entering the room and calling the number to find out about the plane tickets Henry purchased. He was following the group around. It wouldn‚Äôt be a hard stretch that he followed them to the woods and saw the bacchanal/orgy. 


He would have been upset he wasn‚Äôt invited because of his socioeconomic background. And upset that Bunny was invited over him. 
&#x200B;

Camilla thought she saw another person there. Henry thought he saw Dionysus  there. Though it could have been Julian it could have also been Richard. 
&#x200B;

He admits he omits things and considered lying about Julian, he romanticizes Henry despite the murder, he easily went along with the murder of Bunny and has a thought of attacking and SAing Camilla and there is an implication he WAS lying about something very important. Which leads up to question what did he lie about?
&#x200B;

 He is not as horrified or concerned like a normal person would be when hearing your new friends just committed a brutal ritualistic murder. I think he was there, either as voyeur/bystander or he actually participated and was afraid Bunny might know or would find out which is why he goes along with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16fvdu7/the_secret_history_by_donna_tartt_theories/,2023-09-11T13:31:36Z,8,32,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
uiyvl1,So I read The Secret History by Donna Tartt," 

Hey ya‚Äôll!

So I read this book, The Secret History, shortly after reading he Goldfinch. I wrote another thing on that, didn't like it very much, but I  got recommended this book by a number of people, so I decided to give it a try to see if I could get into this author.

I thank those people because I really liked this book. 

I finished it in less than a week( I‚Äôm a slow reader so this is a feat), it wasan emotional draining process, but a rewarding one, and it kept me engaged the whole way through( I think this is a power this specific author has because I experienced this with The Goldfinch just not to the same degree).

There's a lot going on with this book, and a lot to think about. I probably wouldn't be writing this if there wasn‚Äôt.

**The Plot:**

The book starts with a very interesting and slightly obscure premise, I was surprised by how rapidly events progress( after having read the Goldfinch, which is more slow paced) and I appreciated the mix of the mundane with plot progression. Even scenes or chapters where the characters were seemingly doing nothing( Hanging out at Francis‚Äô cottage) were important, to establish a dynamic and nostalgia for this sort of environment. I enjoyed the episodic nature of each chapter, which gives a different tone  be to each location, season and event that happened. Sometimes these tones were drastically different but it still worked , when stitched together.

This Novel has 2 parts , which are drastically different in nature.  The first part, Book 1 is more fun, intriguing and suspenseful, the second part is just pure misery.

I was taken aback at how darkly funny this book could  get and I laughed aloud a good number of times. For example the scenes at the Corcoran's family gettogether, and the overall premise of Bunnys family is just a funny one because it really makes you think of a massive family of rabbits propagating all over the place. 

The whole concept of Francis wanting to escape to Canada because he thinks Canada is in the middle of nowhere is kind of hilarious to me as a Canadian. 

The Greek and literary discussions flew over my head but they were still interesting and I know I would have been able to enjoy it if I read this book at an older age, which I will someday. 

**Characters:**

Its no secret that all these characters were awful as people and yet personally, I found them to be  incredibly sympathetic. This is one of these instances  where you have a book with nasty people who are at the same time amazing character, leaving you confused on whether to love or hate them.

Let‚Äôs start with:

*Bunny:*

Most people hate Bunny for obvious reasons, he‚Äôs a bigot, he's a leech, and becomes a major asshole before his death which makes you root for his ultimate demise.  I, like Richard, unfortunately  could not bring myself to  hate him and I felt rather sorry for him especially with the context we received in the second book which made his death and the behavior  near his death all the more tragic. What can I say?  I fall for the black sheep in the flock. 

I sort of wish Bunny had the brains to get Richard on his side so the two of them could just run  away from Hamden after the whole thing with  the bacchanal(Francis could come too!) Then Bunny wouldn't have to die and all the miserable things that happen in Book 2 wouldn't have to happen.

*Henry:*

Henry  is a great character,  a brilliant yet emotionally stunted person. In an interview Tartt describes his fatal flaw as an obsession with perfection. In a sense Henry wanted to weed out all the things about him that were imperfect(  his emotions specifically).  Beneath his romanticized veneer put there by Richard, Henry is cold and calculating, manipulating  those around him to fall into step( Charles, Richard, Bunny). Frankly Henry can be an asshole and an idiot  in a calm distinguished way that makes him seem intelligent and charming. 

What I like most about Henry was his underlying  vulnerability. This can be glimpsed briefly in moments such as when he reads  Bunny‚Äôs favorite poem, his speech about feeling dead inside for most of his life and his love for Julian. Henry tried to act in a noble refined way his whole life,  but there were also some aspects of himself he could never erase. 

*Charles:*  I really felt sorry for him the most. Alcoholism is a terrible disease and  I feel like he out of  everyone suffered the most after Bunny‚Äôs death. 

*Camilla*: I found Camilla interesting because the reader is never really  to see her for who she was, since  we were seeing her from  a male perspective. I didn‚Äôt like the way Richard antagonized her in the incident with Charles framing her as a villain, despite her facing obvious abuse. 

*Francis:* 

He is probably the least detestable of the bunch as he doesn‚Äôt really ACT in any sort of nasty way, I felt rather sorry for him too especially in the epilogue 

‚Äú*Dickie boy!‚Äù*:

Some might find Richard, the narrator bland which I'll admit  he was at times but there was enough going on with his unreliability to keep interested in him. He‚Äôs definitely more intriguing than another male donna tartt protagonist that I‚Äôve come to know‚Ä¶ 

**Themes and stuff:** 

There‚Äôs a ton to be analyzed  which I don‚Äôt have time to go into, in depth:

Classism, morality, the psychology of each character and literary references.

This would probably make this book a fantastic for  school ( if I got to read this book for school I would have been happy to do so) but unfortunately Shakespeare and the classics still reign supreme in my high school. 

**Some interesting stuff:** 

Overall I was left with a number of questions and observations after finishing, like 

Did anyone notice how often Henry lied to Richard about Bunny saying untrue things like ‚Äú oh he never liked you‚Ä¶‚Äù , or how  he purposefully put Bunny and Richard against one another. Does anyone truly believe Bunny hated Richard? Or that he was angry with Henry because he felt ‚Äúleft out‚Äù of the bacchanal. 

Speaking of the Bacchanal, there's a theory floating around that I've noticed that the farmer was killed, purposefully , as a sacrifice. 

What's with  the number of animal references in this book, why did characters often come across animals, such as the pregnant dog or the cougar , or kill animals?

What‚Äôs the meaning behind the dreams in this book? Especially the final one with Henry in it?

What the fuck is even going on in the drug subplot- I just barely followed?

**This vs the Goldfinch** 

In my opinion this book was much better than The Goldfinch, more collected( although there were repetitive moments and times where the book dragged) 

The characters were much better and much more fleshed out here as well.

Richard is far more interesting than Theo and I think the fact that Richard plays the role of observer instead of the ""main charcter"" has a lot to do with that.

I also just really enjoyed reading this book far more than the goldfinch.

&#x200B;

Any way if you read this I thank you for hearing me ramble.

TL; DR: Great book! Loved the vibes and episodic nature to each chapter! The characters suck as people but are amazing as characters! The  Plot is  well paced( most of the time). I enjoyed the dark humor, this would make a  book to read for  school. I liked this book  better than The Goldfinch.

184ov3x,The Secret History & If We Were Villains Comparison,"Before I get into this I want to say that I enjoyed both books, so I'm definitely out for genuine discussion, not a fight! We can agree to disagree. I compare them with love and genuine interest.


I'm in the minority but I think IWWV was a better book. TSH is far better written- Tartt is an amazing writer, no doubt about that, it's long as hell with plenty of scenes that don't directly pull the action one way or the other, yet only once or twice did I find the story dragging. That's the only reason the book is SO beloved IMO, because as literature, it was shallow. When I'd finished, I felt like I'd read a fun, gripping thriller, but for all the literary merit people had ascribed to it, I had high expectations and was disappointed by the delivery.

I know that a big theme is supposed to be the dark side of an obsession with beauty/aesthetics and academics, but I barely perceived that throughout the book. The first third or half delivered on this, but once murder was a thing out in the open, most of the character's conversations and actions revolved around calling each other, driving around together, giving each other money and favors, and terse conversations about calling, driving around together, and giving each other money and favors. This was all as a result of their paranoia and bonding over secrecy, so sure, it's related, but Greek, academia, aesthetics, etc. were hardly a blip on the radar compared to the murder and its aftermath. Which is fine! But that doesn't exactly scream ""students falling into a dark obsession with philosophy and Greek culture/art"" to me. Once shit got real they pretty firmly had both feet in the present day real world for the rest of the novel. If anything the themes I'd get from the story sum up to ""fuck around and find out"", with the whole thing surrounding the Dionysian ritual being more of a delivery vehicle than maintaining any deeper thematic relevance of its own. Maybe I just don't know enough about Greek classics and I'm missing connections- if you have more information or simply want to share your perspective on this I'd love to know!

With that in mind, I think it's interesting that the biggest complaint I see about IWWV is the devotion of the main cast to Shakespeare: they quoted it too much, too accurately, they cared too much about it, they made it their whole personality, etc. For one, I wonder if people who say this have ever hung out with a group of serious theater people who do shows together, because I thought it was pretty damn accurate. If you're not in the cast with them it can get unbearable.

But more importantly, that's exactly what people say they like about TSH, and which I found so lacking in TSH! The characters' obsession with Shakespeare was deeply entwined with the drama that unfolded. They DID take their academics, their elite group, the philosophy behind their studies, too far. They WERE pretentious where TSH's cast was simply bourgeois and cold. I think IWWV did a much better job thematically. I'd love to hear y'alls thoughts on this.

I thought the characters in both books were pretty two-dimensional, but that both did unreliable narrators in an engaging enough way that I can blame it on the protagonists, lol. Neither had much in the way of true mystery, but still managed to be tense and thrilling. TSH did a better job fleshing out the world ""beyond"" the exclusionary group, which made it feel more real and lent to some funny passages, but the lack of that in IWWV supported the isolated and codependent feeling of the main cast. I thought TSH did romance better, by which I mean there was less of it, lol.

Any other thoughts on comparing the books? After reading them both it's obvious why they always get brought up together, but I like them for such different reasons!

1067ibo,"My Friend Skipped the Prologue in ""A Secret History""","So, me and a friend started reading ""A Secret History"" by Donna Tartt. I just finished the book and she's read a chapter or two (since she reads books quicker, i started a few days before her), and she just told me she skipped the prologue.

Now, I get sometimes skipping the prologue. I skip Tolkien's prologues quite actively, but she refuses the read the prologue at all just out of principle. I tried to explain to her that it's really important but I know her, she won't do it even though it's very short.

\[Spoilers Ahead\]

Since it basically tells you how Bunny died, I'm wondering how it will affect her reading experience. The prologue tells you not only that bunny died, but how he died, which does play into the narration quite a bit throughout the first half. Richard explains that Bunny died multiple times in passing before he actually does, which means even if she doesn't read those first two pages, she'll still get the sense that Bunny dies regardless. It'll just be different.

I guess I'm wondering what other people's thoughts are on skipping this specific prologue, since it's not really a prologue in a traditional sense, but arguably one of the most important events in the story: the catalyst for basically everything in the second half. But then again, the book is written in a way that you'd pick up on that regardless if you read the prologue or not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1067ibo/my_friend_skipped_the_prologue_in_a_secret_history/,2023-01-08T02:43:56Z,37,20,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
15xaii5,The Secret History- my thesis,"I am decades late to the party, but I just finished The Secret History by Donna Tartt and there is so much I want to get off of my chest. 

First, I thought overall it was a good story about a group of very broken people. Here are just some of my quick thoughts about each character:

Camilla: I am convinced that her extreme passivity (like when her brother kisses her and she just acts like nothing happened) is a coping mechanism from some kind of past, unspeakable trauma. My gut is telling me that her uncle (who lived with her) must have assaulted her in some way (with no parents to protect her and a grandma who is clearly not good at picking up on subtext). It must have been horrible for her when she finally makes her own choice (to be with Henry, who is also controlling and manipulative but we‚Äôll get into that later), everything goes to hell. 

Charles: I think Charles must have witnessed his sister getting hurt, which is why they repeat the same cycle together. I felt like at his core, Charles must have been a very empathetic young man, but he never had a good role model to channel his sensitivity into healthy ways, so it instead got expressed in horrible ways (for example, he turns to alcohol when he feels guilt for killing Bunny, and he becomes possessive of his sister in a very twisted way as his form of protection). I don‚Äôt know how to read his ending- was it him finally breaking free from his cycle, or was it just the next level of his demise? 

Richard: I thought Richard was interesting as the main character, because it seems like his biggest issue is his complete and total lack of self awareness. Like zero emotional intelligence and lack of connection to the Self. He looks down on others for their drug use, but to the reader he is clearly a drug addict himself. He says he felt nothing from killing Bunny, but he clearly exhibits physical and mental consequences from his action. He says he loves Camilla, but he wanted to sexually assault her because she didn‚Äôt love him. As the main character, it was such a good choice because we had to work hard to figure out what the heck was actually going on. 

Francis: at first Francis was the only one who I didn‚Äôt hate, but then he showed his problem- his extreme selfishness- by 1) agreeing that he felt bad about killing someone but didn‚Äôt think he should go to jail for it. 2) sexually assaulting Richard (I mean Richard is obviously bisexual to us, but he told Francis no many times and Francis kept going). I also felt bad for him because he was clearly in love with Charles, but all sympathy went out the window when he 3) married a poor woman who is in for a tragic marriage because he is addicted to his family‚Äôs money. 

Henry: out of everyone, I think Henry was the most typical person with anti-social personality disorder. He was smart and manipulative, and he exhibited no signs of remorse for wielding it. I think the only thing that saved him was his obsession with Greek mythology, whose stories and morals served as a guide for his own. So much so that when the living embodiment and his role model for Greek mythology let him down - Julian- he took the role himself to uphold his own views. I did think it was interesting how many times Henry expressed his wishes to not be himself, but I have no idea what to make of that. 

Bunny: while all of them were onerous, Bunny was the one who struck me as having his issues right underneath the surface (expressed through his bigotry and shameless blackmailing) whereas everyone else had their issues deeper inside. I still don‚Äôt know if he actually felt guilt for what happened to the farmer, or if his devolution was motivated by his hurt narcissism. 

Julian: maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm an adult, but I thought Julian was a loser from pretty much the beginning. It seems obvious that he‚Äôs a teacher for the wrong reasons, and he picks weak pupils because he wants to feel impressed with himself. Julian could not have responded in any other way than the way he did. 

The blamed Arabs: as an Arabic speaker myself, I thought this segue was pretty hilarious. I also think it ties in the entire point of this book into one thing that Charles said: it‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre so smart that they were able to get away with it, it‚Äôs just because they don‚Äôt look LOOK like the kind of people who would kill someone. Conversely, ‚Äúdark‚Äù people look exactly like the kind of people who kill. And I think that was the main point of this entire story. 

These people- incredibly broken and flawed like all of us- believed in the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù they had of themselves and that was projected back onto them by Julian, the school, and society in general. In believing it, instead of working to heal the worst parts of themselves, their worst parts took over, propped up by the false justification that they‚Äôre special. And that was what led to their downfall. 

TL;DR- Honestly, if you wanted to, you could probably draw a direct comparison of the characters‚Äô downfall to every time a Karen explodes on YouTube.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15xaii5/the_secret_history_my_thesis/,2023-08-21T15:14:36Z,2,12,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
z1aq4p,The Secret History: Is Henry Autistic? (A Theory),"I think he is the most misunderstood character, both by the audience and by the characters. As an autistic woman I relate a lot to Henry, and his actions make a lot of sense to me. I think he is autistic too and there are many signs of it throughout the story:

1. He suffers from sensory overload. That‚Äôs why he keeps the oil lamps.

2. He suffers from alexithymia. We either get this from PTSD (Henry‚Äôs accident could have cause it) or from numbness (emotional response to sensory overload). Alexithymia often do not let you recognize your feelings (unless these are very strong) and makes you feel that you don‚Äôt have sympathy for others. It can get worse or better at times. 
-Right after Bunny‚Äôs murder, Henry acts as though he doesn‚Äôt care by shifting the conversation to unimportant topics related to classics. It‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs not affected; it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs so affected that he is avoiding the topic, and he doesn‚Äôt know how to express his feelings nor does he want to open up.
-After Henry starts to live with Camilla, Richard notices that he looks ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù and ‚Äúrelaxed.‚Äù This is a sign that his alexithymia has improved because of his relationship with Camilla. Henry also tells Richard that he loves Julian, and Henry tells Camilla that he loves her. It proves that he has feelings.
-He also accompanies Richard at the hospital and lets him stay with him. If he was only trying to use Richard, he would have paid for the bills and find him a place to stay, but by accompanying him he shows that he is concerned.
-He also buys Bunny the books for school, and he‚Äôs very upset when Bunny fools Richard at the restaurant.

3. He wears the same style of clothes everyday and always carries an umbrella everywhere. Many autistic people wear and eat the same. We also hate unpredictability: hence the umbrella.

4. He deals with everything in extremes: murder, kidnapping, etc. Not to say that we have a tendency to  murder people, but when finding solutions we almost never consider the moral and emotional consequences of our actions. This is because the rational solution is what makes the most sense to us.

5. Strong interests / love for beauty and aesthetic/ isolation: our strong interests isolate us from the world. Henry knows nothing about the contemporary world, and tries to find solutions to real problems through his knowledge of classics. Murder in Ancient Greece was not acceptable, but if you purified yourself if was fine.
-This plays in the themes of the novel. Camilla says they purified themselves after the farmer was killed, but they didn‚Äôt do it after they killed Bunny. That‚Äôs why Henry soils his shirt with mud‚Äîbecause he is still polluted.
-I too use my historical knowledge to solve different problems. 
-our isolation from the world happens because the world is too noisy, bright, and crowded to us, and because society doesn‚Äôt resonate with us. It is even hard to bond with people with whom we share the same interests because they don‚Äôt show interest in the things they like with the same intensity and passion that we do. Everything out of our bubble becomes dull and unchallenging. This is why the loss of Julian affects Henry so much. Julian is more than an equal to Henry. 

6. Hyper-focus: Henry can read everywhere. Hyper focus is an unnatural way to focus. We can‚Äôt snap out of it if we want to; it happens mostly we things we like; and it makes up learn faster than other people. When we master certain topics, they become boring. 
-Henry drops out of high school and doesn‚Äôt mind dropping out of university because the new professor is unchallenging. I dropped too from 6 different university programs until I found something challenging enough to keep me interested.

7. Didactic monologues: many of us do this with topics we like. It‚Äôs an impulse that we cannot control.

8. Stims: autistic people who are never diagnosed or who are diagnosed later in life develop socially acceptable ways to stim. Henry‚Äôs is smoking and cleaning his eyeglasses. 

9. Routines and unpredictability: he doesn‚Äôt answer the door/ phone. We don‚Äôt like interruptions, so we avoid answering doors/calls. 

10. ‚ÄúControl freak:‚Äù we hate unpredictability and improvisation, so we plan meticulously everything in our lives to avoid upsetting our routines.

11. ‚ÄúManipulation‚Äù: because we hate unpredictability and improvisation, and because we are terrible at social interactions, we learn the patterns of behaviour of our friends to predict how are they going to react to and how they expect us to react. Notice that when Richard joins the group, Henry is very rude to him. He is annoyed because he doesn‚Äôt know what to expect from Richard and how he is supposed to act in front of him. 

12. Suicide: many autistic people suffer from suicidal thoughts, not necessarily because our lives are bad, but because we can‚Äôt deal with sensory overload, our self imposed isolation, and the loneliness of knowing that we might never find someone like us to share the things we love.

I think Henry has multiple reasons to commit suicide. His sacrifice solves many things in his head. It becomes the most rational solution to him.
- he saves his friends
- it‚Äôs the only way out
-death redeems him from his sins‚Äî at this point he knows he has caused all this mess. And Charles blames everything on him. 
-he proves that he is not a coward like Julian
-he controls his fate.
- it is poetic/ the Greek ideal of honour. He tries to prove that his knowledge of the ancient world is actually relevant to solve contemporary conflicts.

I think he has suicidal thoughts before the killings. He suffers a lot from shutdowns. That‚Äôs why he often disappears.
-shutdowns can be beneficial because they help us heal from sensory and social overload, but if they happen too often they can cause isolation and depression.
- Henry says he felt ‚Äúparalyzed‚Äù and ‚Äúdead‚Äù that‚Äôs what bad shutdowns do to you.
- he doesn‚Äôt necessarily enjoy killing; he enjoyed the bacchanal because it helped him to feel free and to ‚Äúlive without thinking.‚Äù For many of us, thoughts are a reality and they become a prison. Our inflexibility with routines and inability to accept the unpredictable hinders us from enjoying life like others do.

Henry never says he enjoys killing; he says he felt something when he did it. Richard knows what he means because he felt the same. For me this is the euforia/ horror/ danger and beauty of death. This is related to the sublime themes of the novel. Terror has the power to incite wonder and fear. For a more in depth explanation of this check Edmund Burke‚Äôs A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of the Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful. 

There are more signs of Henry being neurodivergent. I pointed out the most important traits. 

I know I might be projecting, but I still would like to know what you think. It is sad to see how many autistic coded characters always end up being killers üò™ and even more painful how readers think they are sociopaths and psychopaths and disregard their noble qualities easily.

165qf5t,The Secret History by Donna Tart - A question,"So...just to be clear, our narrator believes all 5 of the people who tell them that they saw a literal Greek god with their own eyes. After this he asks only two different people two questions about that experience, in the next 400 pages, and both of them are 'What was it like?'. 


And then the fact that they experienced divinity loses relevance for the rest of the book? 

I get that their real world problems were...problematic, but like...idk lmfao. It really seems like '5 people find out Greek gods exist, with certainty' would be a plot point of any kind, not just a catalyst for one.

sho4f9,The Secret History,"I assume other people here have read this book. If you have, please give me all the opinions and theories you have. I just finished it after almost a month long read which is pretty rare for me to take so long but ??? It was incredibly good but also quite unlike any other book I have ever read. Also, I decided to tandem read Dante‚Äôs Inferno during this and I really am feeling though there‚Äôs many correlations between the two. I mean, Richard and Dante to me have so many similarities and then all of their flaws I‚Äôm almost 100 percent sure I could connect to each layer of hell. Incredibly well written book, absolutely amazing, just incredibly absolutely mind numbingly complex and confusing and reading it was a bit like watching a car crash.

1ajm4fu,"Ash: A Secret History, by Mary Gentle, is the Best Book I Have Read in a Long Time","It seems that every year or so someone makes a post here about what a great book Ash: A Secret History is. I suppose this year it is my turn. [About a year ago I read this review of the novel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/wg0a5y/mary_gentles_ash_a_forgotten_1113_page/) and it stuck in my mind for months. Something about it spoke to me. Mystery? Alt-history? A certain grittiness? Audacity perhaps? Eventually I bought it on Amazon and that was the best reading decision I have made in a long time.

[*Ash: A Secret History*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash:_A_Secret_History), by Mary Gentle, is the best book I have read in years. The book is about the eponymous Ash, a female 15th century Burgundian mercenary captain who hears a voice that she believes to be a saint giving her military advice. And it only gets weirder from there. 
The bulk of the novel follows Ash on her adventures in an alternate history late medieval Europe. It also uses an epistolary framing device where each section opens with a series of emails between the professor translating the work, his literary agent, and other relevant parties. The premise of this device is that the professor is completing a translation of a medieval manuscript which contains the diegetic text of the novel. This framing device is leveraged in several ways. Firstly, our professor Pierce Ratcliffe is just as well realized a character as anyone else in the story. His emails read exactly like an older professor slightly befuddled by modern technology, but still incredibly smart and charismatic, in a slightly old-fashioned way. I buy him completely as an Oxford academic. The framing device also allows Dr. Ratcliffe to insert footnotes explaining things, which are actually Gentle inserting footnotes to explain things, but without breaking the diegesis to do so.

Mary Gentle was completing a Masters in War Studies while writing this book, and it shows over the course of the book. The combat scenes have a verisimilitude I have seen matched nowhere else in fiction. They are frantic, confused, visceral, and frightening. When they start it's like tipping over the edge of a roller coaster, you know things are about to kick up a gear. But she doesn't glorify violence. Characters shit themselves in fear, are wounded, kill and are killed in very grounded ways. There are no great heroes, only people trying to achieve their goals. Finally on this point, the battles make sense. When combat begins you always know what is going on and why. You know how the troops are dispositioned and what they are trying to do. And it is all justified in the text because our protagonist occupies a command position so the exposition never feels forced; it's natural for a commander to receive reports and give orders in battle so it's natural for you to know.

This combines with the framing device into one of my favourite little bits of the book. Each time a battle happens Gentle uses tactics and scenarios from real life to add colour to them. But through the footnotes Dr. Ratcliffe explains where these tactics and events happened and suggests they were added by the original chronicler for flavour. This way the reader is fed more information without attention ever being drawn to it. I cannot emphasize enough how smoothly the framing device is integrated into the bulk of the story. It's impressive.

I do not want you to go away with the notion that this is a mechanical nuts-and-bolts military action story. It is anything but. The characters are vivid, believable, and act true to their established characters. One of the major supporting characters, Florian, is a surgeon serving in Ash's company, and his hatred of violence and killing is repeatedly brought up against his serving in a mercenary company. He loathes the fighting but there is nothing he can do about it. Another supporting character, Fernando, is just a spoiled rich kid suddenly flung into war. Over the course of the novel he has to grapple with his weaknesses and find a way to overcome them, if not in the way you might expect. And of course our protagonist Ash, given the story is told from her perspective, receives particular character study. She is one tough son of a bitch, having grown up in a mercenary camp. The book opens with her at eight years old, managing to kill two men who had just raped her. In the next scene she goes to slaughter an ox and struggles with the deed. The contrast of these two scenes informs her entire character throughout the novel; capable of spectacular violence, but not necessarily happy about it. She is fascinating.

Her trials and tribulations over the course of the novel allow for exploration of feminist themes without dwelling on them. She deals with the patriarchy quite literally in an arranged marriage. She grapples with pregnancy and a miscarriage. She suffers from sexual assault. She also bests men in combat and is unapologetically a sexual being. All of it is part and parcel of living in the 15th century and so it is depicted.

Gentle also put her medieval studies to work depicting the world. While she never drags out a scene showing off her knowledge of the medieval world, she does fit in tidbits and depictions of medieval life whenever appropriate. This adds life and character to the world and serves to make it feel real, rather than just 21st century people with cruder technology. This is one of the true strengths of the novel. Instead of a ASoIaF style cynicism of religion the characters in this novel truly believe in God, the Green Christ, and all the rest. Ash uses a ""charm"" as contraception because she truly believes it works. Because that's what people in the 15th century actually believed.

Above I mentioned that this is an alternate history. While I will not dive too deeply into it, because again spoilers, I like how the alternate history aspects are slowly incorporated into the story. At first the world appears to be strictly historical fiction, but over the course of the novel the different aspects of the alternate history appear and are integrated into the narrative. They play into the central mystery of the novel, and together with the two plots converge at the climax. The drip feed of details is extremely well done and every time you think you finally understand something Gentle stops you and reveals another detail.

You will note I have not discussed the plot much. That's because it's hard to do without spoiling the major revelations of the story. For the first three quarters of the novel I had no idea where they story was going to end up. While the story twists and turns it never feels arbitrary. The events simply lead one into another and the pacing keeps you engaged for the whole wild ride. Towards the end the frame narrative and the ""bulk"" narrative begin to converge and we see the same events examined through both the 15th century and 21st century minds. This helps the reader finally put into context the events of the bulk of the novel and actually understand what they have only half glimpsed so far.

This book is unlike any other book I have read. It combines historical fiction, alternate history, and fantasy in a way I have never seen before but hope to see again. If you like mysteries, fantasy, historical fiction, strong female characters, or any combination thereof you absolutely need to read it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ajm4fu/ash_a_secret_history_by_mary_gentle_is_the_best/,2024-02-05T17:29:25Z,18,31,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
u7s3gg,Theory about The Secret History by Donna Tartt,"Hello! I finished another reread of The Secret History, and I just wanted to share my take on the theory floating around that the group didn't actually kill the farmer, but a large cat (i.e. a cougar of some sort) did. I first saw this theory on this same subreddit but I thought it would be nice to have its own separate post because I want to hear other people's opinions on this!

[https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7x4tl8/the\_secret\_history\_by\_donna\_tartt\_alternate\_killer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7x4tl8/the_secret_history_by_donna_tartt_alternate_killer/) (LINK TO POST I SAW)

The theory that the large cat was actually the killer is possible, if not probable. Personally, I think the group actually killed a deer, stumbled around in an inebriated state, and ended up on the farmer's land, where the farmer was already killed by the cat (they were probably attacked by it too, seeing as Charles got bit by some ""unknown"" creature). It was around this point that the ""effects"" of the bacchanal were wearing off, so they probably assumed that they killed the farmer instead. The other details of their night get mixed up too when they told Richard the story.

Some lines in the book that I think help support this theory:

1. ""***Charles had a bloody bite mark on his arm that he had no idea how he'd got, but it wasn't a human bite.""*** *p. 168* \-> Bite was from the large cat when they arrived on the farmer's land.
2. ""***Camilla said that during part of it, she'd believed she was a deer; and that was odd, too, because the rest of us remember chasing a deer through the woods.""*** *p. 168* \->  They were all chasing a deer through the woods. Camilla just thought she was the deer because she wasn't sober.
3. ***""Things started to come back....... I bent down, too, and saw it was a man. He was dead.""*** *p. 169* \-> The first thing they see when they come out of their stupor is the dead farmer, mauled by the cat. Since they were already covered in blood from killing the deer, but they thought Camilla was the deer and hence they believed that they didn't kill a deer, they immediately assume that they killed the farmer.
4. ***""I'll never forget the smell of it, either. Like when my uncle used to cut up deer.""*** *p. 359* \-> Camilla recounts the night of the bacchanal, and she says that the man's body smelled like a deer's dead body. She had the deer's blood on her hands and thought it was coming from the man.
5. ""***They don't have those \[cougars\] around here."" 'They used to. They called them catamounts.'***  *p. 437 ->* Proof that *c*ougars do prowl around the area.

Although one thing that does throw me off a bit is when Richard mentions a newspaper clipping that says that the farmer's body was mutilated, so it couldn't have been a wild animal attack. But it doesn't really specify further, so maybe the body was just mauled so badly they couldn't perform a proper autopsy?

wdhr85,The Secret History by Donna Tartt,"So I just read The Secret History and it‚Äôs been driving me absolutely bonkers trying to figure out when the book takes place. 
It must be after 1982, because Davenport says at one point in reference to another case ‚Äúwhen was it, 1982?‚Äù Yet it had to have been before October 1984, as the main characters are 20 years old and drinking and purchasing liquor without any reference to fake IDs. But at one point, Richard refers to a Vermont show that has a question and answer period like Oprah. But The Oprah Winfrey show didn‚Äôt air until 1986. 
I realize the narrator is writing everything in retrospect, so perhaps that reference was merely thrown in, but I have truly been losing sleep over this.

A couple thoughts I had: 

\-Do you think that whatever relations between Charles and Camilla were consensual? I had a bad feeling when he first called her ""Milly"" and was upset Richard was there that something had been up. Did anyone catch anything earlier than that? 

\-I've been reading through some of the older posts about this, and I actually thought Julian left as punishment for their actions initially. I agree that he, like Henry, had a perverse-level interest in the twisted agony/aesthetics of the Greek tragedies. I know that he encouraged the baccanal and ultimately didn't turn them in for Bunny's murder, partially in preservation of his image, I interpreted as they took it too far, and that was the reprimand. Julian was the most important person in Henry's life, and that purposefully severed tie was the ultimate punishment for him.

Not the least of which is, how long is the typical recuperation?

1) What exactly was going on with Henry's car at the end?  I can't decide if Henry really is an irredeemable emotionless bastard and it was a plot to throw Richard under the bus. But what else could it be?

2) Were any of them really Richard's friends, as elitist as they all were? I can't imagine Richard's attempts to appear privileged were as successful as the character thinks. There was never a dramatic reveal of Richard's lowly origins.

3) Do you think the casual attitude on drugs was a deliberate potshot (pun intended) at the stuffy egos of New England liberal arts colleges like Hampden? Any author who could write these characters is familiar with insecurity. Maybe it's a 'I'm a cool kid' front, and the author's ego showing. I read she went to Bennington.

tkab5q,What do you all think about Dona Tarrt's The Secret History?,"I just finished reading the book myself. What a story! I really appreciate the effort the writer put into developing the characters, especially to make sure that none of them were likeable. Seriously though, the characters are actually quite realistic and pretty much what you'd expect a bunch of elite, out-of-touch college students to be like.

What do you all think of it though?

Edit: I should add that one of the reasons I liked the book so much was how relatable Richard's character was for me. I myself come from a rather humble background while most of my classmates in college belong to elite families. Like Richard himself, I was quite impressed by the glamor at first over time have become quite disillusioned by just how mediocre most of them are (though, unlike Richard, I managed to figure it out without committing any murder).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tkab5q/what_do_you_all_think_about_dona_tarrts_the/,2022-03-22T19:00:14Z,36,39,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
15w0dnv,The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt (Spoilers for The Secret History as well),"I really enjoyed this book reading it through a lens of it being literary fiction and not as much a plot driven narrative. Although the plot was interesting, it fell short for me at times because it seemed like the murder was out of left field, barely explained, and then they saw no consequences for it. Not only that but the plot centered around this painting imo was pretty weak, it wasn‚Äôt too involved for most of the book it just sat in his room or in a storage unit. I read the secret history this year as well and thought she did a great job with the psychological torture of the murder, and she did a great job with it in this book as well, but didn‚Äôt establish a resolution in terms of consequences, or lack thereof. I really enjoyed the part before theo‚Äôs adulthood, it‚Äôs probably my favorite part of the book because I don‚Äôt like adult theo as much (I doubt we are supposed to) and I don‚Äôt really know what else to say. Just that the writing is absolutely gorgeous and theo‚Äôs pontifications and descriptions of how he experiences the world were some of the best writing I have read, but I can understand why this book is controversial.

v8b586,The Secret History,"
(Edit: I‚Äôm not trying to glamorize anything I really spoke of in this review. I‚Äôm mentally and physically happier than I ever have been. High School, and I‚Äôm sure college too are definitely that awkward stage in life, which many, including myself struggle with to certain aspects) 

I solemnly believe that this masterpiece of a novel couldn‚Äôt have found me at a better point in my life. Being a month graduated from high school, nearing my adult life, 19 just a few months away the thoughts provoked in this novel all came to me at times in my years throughout school. 

For one, this book finds you, you don‚Äôt seek it.

This may be a little heavy but, this book provoked a lot of past, present, and recent thoughts I‚Äôve pondered. Nearing the age of 19, I wondered sometimes how old I‚Äôd grow to be; wondering if I would graduate high school, hit the age of becoming a legal adult. Whether I‚Äôd walk out the door until the scenery wasn‚Äôt one I was aware of, perhaps funneling in and out of society until I and the people around me could accept who I am, even thoughts of getting in a car accident and the last thing I‚Äôd see was the brights of a car in front of me (with whatever unpleasant popular pop song was playing on the radio), or if in a depressed daze turn to a bottle of pills, one of which the affects scrunched too small to read, and listen to my heart beat fade away. 

However, high school is just that. Faces, some of which you recognize as friends, foe‚Äôs, or just a blur in the crowd of people you may have only seen getting out of their cars in the parking lot. Not to chalk myself up to be depressed, although I‚Äôd considered if that may be the case a multitude of times throughout my high school journey. I had friends, I had acquaintances, and I along everyone else had my ups and downs. Friends come and go, they fade into the crowd of people you once knew until you‚Äôre deposited into a new facade of individuals trying to figure how you came to be. This thought provoking novel does just that in every page. 

Chapters of this book felt as if I was living them throughout my wild imagination. I could hear the sprinkle of the rain on a sunny day throughout pages of the book, or the shoveling of snow on the late nights I‚Äôd lay awake, with the only light emitting from the reading lamp ahead of me. This book felt as if I was attached, yet detached from the friend group it introduced me to. An oddly familiar feeling, in which you feel so close, untouchable in the atmosphere of laughs, drinks passed around, and the blurred sound of music coming from what could only be a cheap speaker set in the corner. Feeling detached, and left in the unknown is a fear unlike no other, however it doesn‚Äôt compare to the dense anxiety of being included in what you were meant to be left out on. 

These characters felt like my friends too, and I watched them become unrecognizable whenever I finally closed the book. A young, impressionable group of college kids, trying to find who they are, detached from the rest of the college, the rest of society. However that didn‚Äôt matter, only a class of six students didn‚Äôt spite their closeness. One of which felt dejected from society, from his own family, and yet found a father like son bond with his new, and only teacher. 

There‚Äôs really not much to say without spoiling the novel, which is a sin on its own. All I can say is, this book is a true creation of it‚Äôs time. You can hear the early 2000‚Äôs booming down the street in their modernized vehicles. A beautiful, and ugly novel, which truly touched my heart in a multitude of ways, and I‚Äôm thankful I was grateful enough to read it in this lifetime.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v8b586/the_secret_history/,2022-06-09T07:16:15Z,4,7,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
upulp6,Here's a question that's been bugging me re: the Secret History.,"It's made much of, at the beginning of the book, that professor Julian only allows the best, the brightest, the most exceptional students into his class. So if that's the case... 

Why is Bunny in the class? He's depicted as a kind of lovable, friendly oaf - he doesn't seem particularly smart, and he's certainly not intellectual. He's said to be Henry's best friend, although this seems like kind of a stretch, but surely just that wouldn't be enough to get him into the class, if it's as elite as it it's claimed to be. Does Julian think Bunny is richer or smarter than he actually is? Did he just admit him as kind of foil?

wniokv,Richard Papen from The Secret History by Donna Tartt,"I recently read *The Secret History* with a friend as part of an informal book club and found that we had vastly differing interpretations of Richard.

I thought the point of the book was that Richard is just as bad as the others, and it's only because he's the point of view character (and therefore allegedly telling the truth) that we have a more positive opinion of him. I mean, even in his narrative he makes an entirely unprovoked comment about how he'd like to rape Camilla and, while he doesn't directly participate in Bunny's murder, is perfectly happy to help the others hide the evidence.

My friend, meanwhile, saw Richard as an innocent bystander who's been dragged into an awful situation and makes the decisions he does in order to keep from being murdered himself. Her view of Henry was in a similar vein‚Äîhe kills Bunny because he's scared and cornered and Bunny was ""unreasonable"", which she thought was a valid and, if not fair then at least understandable motive.

I'm curious about what the most common view of Richard is. Do you think he's an unreliable narrator? Am I too harsh on the characters, is she too soft?

Recently, I read ""The Secret History"" for an English class I was taking and I was absolutely blown away by it. From the very first sentence to the end of the book, I was on the edge of my seat. I was wondering if anyone else here has read it, and what you thought of it.

Edit: Basic plot, without going too in depth because spoilers, is that a young man goes to college in New England, meets a very strange group of students in a very strange Greek class, and then they go somewhat crazy.

ux2mxq,The Secret History: Henry,"I recently finished The Secret History by Donna Tartt and I cannot stop thinking about it. 

One thing that was bugging me was Henry's suicide. Richard's explanation for it is not very convincing. I get that Julian was important for Henry but is he important enough to make him suicidal? 

There are also other suspicious aspects of his suicide. He was shot with two bullets to his head, which seems unlikely for a suicide. Another thing is how he lived for 12 hours after the shooting and Richard says that it was as if he wanted to survive it. 

I was thinking that Charles and Richard killed Henry together. Both were scorned and tired of his tyranny in the group. They started to see him as the cause of their misfortunes. Henry's taking Camilla to himself and isolating her from the group could have been the final straw. 

Camilla's rejection of Richard in the end also makes more sense if he was an accomplisher for Henry's murder. 

For Henry to turn to duty, loyalty and aesthetics and commit suicide to save his ""friends"" seems unlikely to me. He was an ambitious character, he was able to do whatever it took to survive. He did not have strong moral concerns and strike me as a machivellian type overall.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ux2mxq/the_secret_history_henry/,2022-05-24T22:19:05Z,3,4,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
kpr9uc,Thoughts on The Secret History?,"Slight spoilers! After constant reminders to read it from my friend, I finally finished TSH last night. It's one of her all time favourites, but I feel SOOO underwhelmed. I wouldn't say its a terrible book, it just left absolutely no impression on me which doesn't happen often. 


I couldn't resonate with any of the characters, who all blended into one big jerk in my mind. I know they're not supposed to be likeable, but I didn't even *dislike* them. I was indifferent to them all. The only one who evoked any emotion in me was Bunny, who was of course was dead before the story even began. The whole second half was a slog for me, with so much filler and prolonged conversations where nothing of significance was said. I feel the 50 page chapter dedicated to Bunny's funeral could have been condensed into 10 pages max.


I also feel soo misled by the blurb!! The 'charasmatic classics professor' is scarcely mentioned and the 'new way of thinking' turns out to be an ancient Roman sex ritual which we aren't even present for. I hoped to learn more about the Bacchanal towards the end, but there was nothing but a few vague snippets.


 I've seen so many glowing reviews, but I've never felt so disengaged from a literary protagonist as I did from Richard. Did something go over my head? Should I bother reading The Goldfinch?

iw7p31,"""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt is stunning","Finished reading it recently and loved it. Such a strangely haunting story that I haven't been able to get out of my head. The prose is absolutely gorgeous, and the atmosphere Donna Tartt creates of autumnal Vermont is incredible - nostalgic, melancholy and dreamlike. The characters are what really drive this story and all the main cast were fascinating, especially Henry and Bunny. None of them are particularly likable people, but they are fascinating, layered and oddly sympathetic in their own way.

It's really compelling to see the path that leads to Bunny's murder and the subsequent fallout - these kids, essentially, who are so detached from real life and live every day like it's some heightened, stylized literary reality, and are not ready for the consequences of their actions. In between, there is genuinely a sense of longing and loneliness and wanting to be part of something greater.

The ending hit me hard too - like Richard, I had gotten really attached to these characters for all their flaws and dysfunctions. Seeing that little group break apart and dissolve into nothing was aching. 

Book isn't perfect though - the pacing is a little wonky at times and the final 25% after bunny's body is discovered is a bit of a bore. But otherwise, it's a fantastic book.

When Henry left Richard because he had an appointment, I kind of interpreted it as him being called to ""serve his time"" in the afterlife by being a sort of guardian. The rest of the group had all mentioned seeing Henry after his passing, and I think it could be fitting considering the fact that you can trace every traumatizing event in the book (the first murder, Bunny's murder, Henry's suicide) directly back to Henry. Maybe to atone for this actions, Henry has to watch the others live their broken lives, knowing he caused the mess..?

n1xehx,Thoughts on The Secret History,"- Includes spoilers about the whole book -
 
Just finished this book and I can‚Äôt get it out of my mind. I feel like a few years has passed since the epilogue and Richard, Camilla, Francis are all living unsatisfactory lifes somewhere in the same world as I live in. Like the way Richard sees Bunny and Henry after their passing, these characters still linger on my mind.  

I have some thoughts I‚Äôd like to hear other people‚Äôs takes on...

1- it is a pretty basic question but - why do you think Henry killed himself? It is not like he felt any remorse for what he has done or caused in other people‚Äôs lives. The only thing that seemed to shook him to his core was Julian realizing Bunny‚Äôs letter was real. The thing that puzzles me is the spontaneity. It was not a planned suicide. Charles walks in with a gun, tries to shoot Henry. Instead Henry takes the gun and does it himself. Nobody expected Charles to point a gun at Henry‚Äôs face. How did Henry the cool, calm and collected person, decide to do it at that instant? I am inclined to say he did it because he loved Camilla. But seeing Charles the psycho, he should have killed Charles to keep her safe, rather than himself if he was to apply some sort of logic. The only thing that deeply affected him was Julian‚Äôs response but how did that rejection translate into an suicide in his mind is really intriguing to me. I‚Äôd be happy to hear others‚Äô theories!

2- Was it only me but the way Donna wrote the book, while they are contemplating to murder Bunny, Richard tells the story in such a way that even I wanted to murder Bunny. The snide and sexist remarks, knowingly bringing up people‚Äôs insecurities... Bunny was annoying beyond belief. But actually when you think about it, Bunny was really just that. Annoying. 
Compare Bunny‚Äôs annoyance to Henry‚Äôs cold and calculating personality, feeling no remorse for two murders, no empathy for how it impacted his friends, the way he lured Richard in, surely to frame it on him if anything goes wrong... Henry was actually the evil one. Next to him Bunny was nothing more than some blabber mouth who did not know boundaries. I found myself feeling horrible that there was once a time I was relieved Bunny was killed. How the turntables!
3- Charles was a scumbag alcoholic, who was physically and sexually abusing his sister. I think Camilla never consented to Charles but was scared of his drunk self and rage attacks so she just went along with it to keep him in her life. He was the only family she had since their parent died young and that surely affected their twin dynamic in a strange way. Richard, even after learning the abuse, still looks out for Charles and protects him. Do you think he sees himself in Charles, both being rejected by Camilla, and that‚Äôs why he feels sympathy for him and anger towards Camilla? Even though the situation surely calls out for the completely opposite attitude. 
4- There is never any solid explanation given for why so many men were attracted to Camilla. She was described as pretty but that‚Äôs it. The way her character was written, being desired by nearly all male characters except Francis for obvious reasons, reminds me of Hollywood‚Äôs ‚Äúcool girl trope‚Äù. You know the girl who is not like any other girls. The second female character is Judy, and guess what? She is the opposite of Camilla with her ‚Äúgirly‚Äù persona. Judy is superficial and annoying (according to Richard). It is strange to see these tropes play out considering a woman is the author. It is not done in a sexist way because usually in movies the only character without a rich backstory would be the cliche women character.But in this book all characters are somewhat equally explored and Camilla does not have a less complex backstory than male ones. But I still wonder why the author chose to write Camilla and Judy this way.

hdvbqc,Camilla from The Secret History,"Hi everyone. I have a few questions about Camilla from The Secret History by Donna Tartt.

Is she gay? I‚Äôve seen a lot of TSH Tik Toks suggesting that she is but I don‚Äôt remember anything in the novel suggesting that she actually is gay. All I remember is that she likes to wear men‚Äôs fashion items, which doesn‚Äôt mean that she‚Äôs gay. Could someone explain this to me?

Also, why is Richard still into her at the end of the novel? I thought it was a bit off given that he knows that his classmates are all terrible people. I felt it was a bit forced imo. Also, I know he‚Äôs an unreliable narrator  but wouldn‚Äôt he get that she‚Äôs still not into him? I mean she literally preferred to have sex with her brother rather than Richard.

Lastly, anyone else feel the sexual relationship between Camilla and Charles was weird/a bit forced? I might just not be getting it but given that she‚Äôs sleeping with Henry and briefly goes out with Cloke (I believe, I may be misremembering). 

Also, is it just me or is everyone besides Francis & Camilla a raging bisexual in the group? I felt this was a bit weird looking back. Not sure if I cared for it as it seemed partially irrelevant to the plot imo.

Also, how is Richard an unreliable narrator? It was a long novel and tbh I didn‚Äôt pay that much attention",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hdvbqc/camilla_from_the_secret_history/,2020-06-22T16:17:09Z,15,37,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
yadwyn,A bit confused about how I'm supposed to interpret Bunny's character from Donna Tartt's The Secret History,"Bunny's rampant bigotry and especially homophobia was a large part of his character in the novel. Richard noted this at one point and indicated that he didn't think it was reminiscent of any kind of internalized hatred, but was simply a prejudice with a lack of nuance. However, something that I always found intriguing about Tartt's books specifically is her utilization of unreliable narrators. This was more obvious in The Goldfinch with characters later bringing up events in more detail than Theo wanted to write about initially.

However, with Richard it seems to be moreso a lack of knowledge and context. Later as he learns more, this changes the narrator's perception of the characters and events as the story progresses. Due to this, I don't know how much faith we are supposed to place in Richard's initial assumption. I won't lie and say I have a whole lot of evidence to back this up with, I don't. It was just this one scene that confused me a bit regarding the nature of Bunny's hatred.

During their lunch at the beginning of the book, Bunny said on page 54 (they start off talking about Camilla):

>""Come on,"" I said, still laughing. ""She's really pretty."" ""That she is, that she is,"" he agreed, holding up a conciliatory palm. ""Lovely girl. I've always said so. Looks just like a statue of Diana in my father's club. All she lacks is a mother's firm hand, but still, for my money, she's what you call a bramble rose, as opposed to your hybrid tea. Doesn't take the pains she ought, you know. And runs around half the time in her brother's sloppy old clothes, which maybe some girls could get away with-well, frankly I don't think any girls can really get away with it, but she certainly can't. Looks too much like her brother. I mean to say, Charles is a handsome fellow and a sterling character all around, but I wouldn't want to marry him, would I?""  
>  
>He was on a roll and was about to say something else; but then, quite suddenly, he stopped, his face souring as if something unpleasant had occurred to him. I was puzzled, yet a little amused; was he afraid he'd said too much, afraid of seeming foolish? I was trying to think of a quick change of subject, to let him off the hook, but then he shifted in his chair and squinted across the room.  
>  
>""Look there,"" he said. ""Think that's us? It's about time.""

The way this is written makes it seem as if Bunny made an uncomfortable realization in relation to marrying Charles. The obvious thing I came away with was that maybe he did like the idea and wasn't happy about that? It feels like the only conclusion I can really draw, but I almost feel stupid for saying it. It really isn't built upon at all in any other part of the book unless you count the fact that Donna Tartt didn't really seem to have a problem making practically every character ambiguously gay/bisexual, so in an odd way, why wouldn't he be?

That just isn't good enough for me though, I want to know what the common interpretation of this is, because honestly this is the only way I was able to read it. However it didn't seem to be alluded to in any other way, so I'm confused.

Was there instead a connection to a completely unrelated event that I missed? Perhaps it's something meant to be ambiguous? I am unsure.

ymr7jp,i kinda need help in understanding The Secret History by Donna Tartt,"so i just started reading tsh a few days ago and i have trouble understanding some stuff and i don't know if they mentioned/hinted it in the book but yeah i just need some help..

1:

>There was roasted lamb, new potatoes, peas with leeks and fennel; a rich and almost maddeningly delicious bottle of Chateau Latour. I was eating with better appetite than I had had in ages when I noticed that a fourth course had appeared, with unobtrusive magic, at my elbow: mushrooms. They were pale and slender-stemmed, of a type I had seen before, steaming in a red wine sauce that smelled of coriander and rue.  
>  
>‚ÄòWhere did you get these?' I said. Hfj 'Ah. You're quite observant,' he said, pleased. 'Aren't they marvelous? Quite rare. Henry brought them to me.'  
>  
>I took a quick swallow of my wine to hide my consternation.  
>  
>'He tells me - may I?' he said, nodding at the bowl. I passed it to him, and he spooned some of them onto his plate. Thank you,' he said. 'What was I saying? Oh, yes. Henry tells me that this particular sort of mushroom was a great favorite of the emperor Claudius. Interesting, because you remember how Claudius died.'  
>  
>I did remember. Agrippina had slipped a poisoned one into his dish one night.  
>  
>‚ÄòThey're quite good,' said Julian, taking a bite. 'Have you gone with Henry on any of his collecting expeditions?""  
>  
>'Not yet. He hasn't asked me to.'  
>  
>'I must say, I never thought I cared very much for mushrooms, but everything he's brought me has been heavenly.' **Suddenly I understood. This was a clever piece of groundwork on Henry's part. 'He's brought them to you before?' I said.**  
>  
>‚ÄòYes. Of course I wouldn't trust just anyone with this sort of thing, but Henry seems to know an amazing lot about it.'  
>  
>'I believe he probably does,' I said, thinking of the boxer dogs.

what are the mushrooms? i understand that henry was thinking of poisoning bunny with amatoxin but what exactly is this part supposed to mean? what are these mushrooms? is julian hinting something? or does he not know? and what does the bolded line mean? i am really confused :C

>He dragged his palms down over his face, as if he were wiping water from it, and looked up at me. 'You don't have a clue,' he said. His eyes were bloodshot, uncomfortably bright. 'Boy. You don't have a fucking clue.'  
>  
>I stood up, unable to bear it any longer, and looked around my room distractedly. 'Uh,' I said, 'do you want an aspirin? I meant to ask you earlier. If you take a couple now you won't feel so bad in the '  
>  
>'You think I'm crazy, don't you?' Bunny said abruptly.  
>  
>**Somehow I'd always known it was going to happen this way, the two of us alone, Bunny drunk, late at night...** 'Why no,' I said. 'All you need is a little'  
>  
>'You think I'm a lunatic. Bats in the belfry. Nobody listens to me,' he said, his voice rising.  
>  
>I was alarmed. 'Calm down,' I said. 'I'm listening to you."" 'Well, listen to this,' he said.  
>  
>It was three in the morning when he stopped talking. The story he told was drunken and garbled, out of sequence and full of vituperative, self righteous digressions; but I had no problem understanding it. It was a story I'd already heard. For a while we sat there, mute. My desk light was shining in my eyes. The party across the way was still going strong and a faint but boisterous rap song throbbed obtrusively in the distance.  
>  
>.......  
>  
>It was fortunate, I suppose, that I didn‚Äôt have to make an effort to look shaken up or stunned. I was so upset I was nearly sick.  
>  
>.......  
>  
>Eight rings, nine; then, to my relief, Charles's sleepy hello.  
>  
>'Hi, it's me,' I said quickly. 'Something happened.'  
>  
>'What?' he said, suddenly alert. I could hear him sitting up in bed.  
>  
>'He told me. Just now.'  
>  
>There was a long silence.  
>  
>'Hello?' I said.  
>  
>'Call Henry,' said Charles abruptly. 'Hang up the phone and call hi right now.'  
>  
>'I already did. He's not answering the phone.'  
>  
>Charles swore under his breath. 'Let me think,' he said. 'Oh, hell. Ca you come over?'  
>  
>'Sure. Now?'

again, what does the bolded line mean? what is the significance of them being alone with bunny drunk?  and ' It was a story I'd already heard.' what's the story? apparently, it made Richard so upset and Charles so worried but i really don't know what exactly the story is,,

lc8z9j,Donna Tartt‚Äôs The Secret History,"Finished this today and loved it! Was back and forth about how I felt about this as I read but found the journey to be emotional towards the end as I really felt for the characters, Francis, Richard, and Camilla in particular and to a lesser extent, Henry. Really found it moving but NOT a thriller at all. I‚Äôm extremely excited to reread it in the future but not soon as it was emotionally draining for me. I am confused about part of it though, with the note that Bunny sends Julian at the end, what exactly was the deal with the stationary from the Excelsior that Henry and Bunny stayed in in Rome around the time the Bacchanal was performed? I reread that part several times and according to the book Henry refused to buy the stationary for him but Bunny reached his hand in the bottom of the barrel or something and grabbed it lol it was weird! If Henry refused to buy it for him how did he get it lol.

g4sesv,Conflicted about Donna Tartt‚Äôs The Secret History,"
I want to start by saying that this isn‚Äôt a critique of Donna Tartt or her ability as a writer. I haven‚Äôt read anything else by her, so this is mostly contained to The Secret History. That being said, I just finished and was wondering if anyone else was a bit underwhelmed, apathetic, or conflicted with it. I don‚Äôt really mean with the climax or characters, more so just with the theme as a whole. I felt like she was making a point about how unfulfilling and ultimately emotionally void the pretensions of academia can be, but I felt like the theme didn‚Äôt develop much from the first chapter. I had a hard time caring about how any of the characters turned out simply because none of them (even Richard) seemed to learn anything. Any time I felt like Richard acknowledged his own point, he seemed to go right back wallowing in his own own pretensions and not doing anything about it. I got the points about beauty and everything on top of that, I just felt very unfulfilled and I wasn‚Äôt sure what more it had to say. I really wanted to like this book but felt a bit let down.

Over, the narrator, Richard‚Äôs experiences at Hampden College, I felt myself become immersed in with his small Greek class. The feeling of acceptance and friendship was palpable. 

When things became odd, especially Bunny‚Äôs erratic behavior, I also found myself with the rest of them; wanting to get rid of the problem.

g3j55v,The Secret History and what happens after the book ends,"About a year ago I was introduced to the idea of [The Death of The Author](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGn9x4-Y_7A). I was fascinated. But even before I even knew there was a term for it, I was already in favor of the argument. That a fiction is just the author's creations written down and there's nothing concrete after the final page is turned. Anytime any of my friends would want to discuss a character's fate after the book/movie ends I would always just shrug it off. ""They're just fiction"", ""Make something up in your head and be happy with it."" It's not like any of us had ever met the author on a sunny afternoon and discussed it over a cup of coffee. Usually, I'd make something up in my mind to console myself. But sometimes, I'd find a book that would just... end in such a frustrating way that it'd leave me gasping for *some* sort of closure.

So, I just finished Donna Tartt's [The Secret History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29044.The_Secret_History). The Goldfinch is one of my favorite books and I couldn't wait to dive into her other works. I loved the book. Only someone as skilled as Tartt could pull off something like this. But it was also a very frustrating book. Tartt intentionally withheld information that made (literally) sit on the edge of my seat. I was skimming through pages just to find out what was actually going on, only to get answers in the vaguest of descriptions and, well, more questions. I'm guessing you've read it and know what I'm talking about.

\[SPOILERS FROM HERE ON\]

Anyways, by the end of the book, we still don't know what had actually happened that night in the woods, and that's not really the point of the book. I don't fret about that. However, it's the closing epilogue that's got me so... upset (?). Reading the last few pages, I assumed, that after being away from them for so long, Richard would sort of come to understand that it was a blessing to be able to get away from them. It was obvious Richard had been depressed his entire life and longed, no, *craved* to be part of a group. But this group had almost ruined his life in a year for something that *they'd* done. But of course, that's not what happened.

What frustrated me the most was the case of Camilla and Richard. I mean, how long had Richard known everybody? Barely a year. And he was head over heels for Camilla. I get that. But he was still in love with her after four/five years, with barely any contact from hers and the others? And what was up with Camilla? She led him on the entire time. Her relationship with Henry couldn't have been going on that long but she was still desperately in love with him years later, for that long*?* And if she was secretly in love with him much longer than we are led to believe, why lead Richard on like that? Of all the characters, Camilla was the vaguest and I still don't know much about her.

Again, it's fiction. It's Tartt's book. And it pretty much ends with Richard confessing his love for Camilla and Camilla telling him how she still loves Henry. And they part, with the foreboding prose that this was the last time they'd see each other. But any reader can guess that they'll meet again sometime in the future. And since I'm so frustrated and don't really know where to go, I'm asking for your opinions. What are your thoughts on what happens afterward?

Do you think that after Camilla's nana dies and she, finally relieved of the burden and nothing to hold her in her solitude, goes out, meets someone new, falls in love (or at least accepts her fate) and settles down? A bit unlikely, I'd say. Or do you think after she starts going out again and realizes that Richard is the only one who she can actually talk to, and be herself with? Do you think they finally find solace in each other? 

That they both wallow in self-isolation is too harsh of a thing for a romantic like me to imagine. And what about Francis? He'd already tried to end his life once. How do you think he'll manage? 

Or do you argue in favor of the death of the author, that it's just fiction and you leave it like that?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g3j55v/the_secret_history_and_what_happens_after_the/,2020-04-18T06:46:11Z,15,37,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

loiz47,The Secret History by Donna Tarrt - A somewhat scattered analysis,"I just finished this book and it left a great impression on me. There's not a lot of books that grab such a hold on me, while also mildly frustrate me.

The books picks up pace from the first page, and I found a lot of the main character's experience somewhat familiar to my own from my time at university (before, you know, the whole murder stuff). Donna Tarrt really nails how easy it can be to become entranced by a a charismatic figure like Julian Morrow, and find yourself pulled along the current of ideas within a very closed group of (in my opinion) elitist people. In the moment it all seems incredibly important and relevant, until you've graduated and wonder what you've actually been doing this whole time. And, man, did I want to scream at Richard for obviously throwing his life away on a whim. 

The way parts the main character remain such a mystery, even when written from his perspective, really pulled me in. It's clear he's even hiding things from himself, channeling his inner Henry by observing first, and acting later. In a way, each of the characters in this group represent an aspect of Richard, only pushed to extremes. He describes Julian as someone who sees the potential and positives in anyone, rather than truly see the person as a while. Richard falls into the same trap, where the in-group is this mysterious and fascinative object of study to him. 

While Richard spends a lot of time describing Charles's problems with alcohol, it's pretty obvious he's got some substance issues of his own. The book, I think, also pretty strongly hints at the possibility of Richard being bisexual, which is explored through Francis (which would've fully come to fruition if it wasn't interrupted, though in a bit of a sketchy manner). Henry I already partially touched upon, but also represents the more silent, stoic and calculating part of Richard. It's true that the main character has a pretty dynamic inner life, but to the outside he expresses *very* little (part of which frustrated me heavily, but I suspect was intented to be). 

Bunny and Richard pretty much fill the same role in the group, hence the beginning conflict and jealousy on Bunny's part. They are the poor student coasting on the money on their friends, pretending to be richer than they are. Bunny does this to an extreme, obviously. He is essentially what Richard has the potential of becoming in the second part, once Bunny is out of the picture.

What Richard has in common with Camilla I find harder to pin down. Both do have a rather passive role in everything that occurs, while both are still a lot more responsible for what happens than they themselves probably want to admit. You never really do get a full reaction from Camilla of the bacchanal. She suffers silently. Descriptions of the event suggest she didn't actively hurt the victim, but did somehow end up with blood in her hair. My impression is that she was an accomplice, and not a active agent in the crime, much like Richard later is when they turn on Bunny. 

I do go back and forth on believing whether the farmer was actually killed by the four, and not by an animal. Descriptions of the man being terribly mutilated, teeth marks on someone's arm, and a short appearance of a cat-like animal much later on, makes it possible they only observed the beast mauling the man and in their drug-induced state, eventually came to believe they did it themselves. 

I skew heavily towards this interpretation because it fits perfectly with the theme of changing perceptions that are threaded throughout the book (Richard never realizing how Henry actually appears to others until someone else points it out, Julian's change from magical mentor figure to flawed and cowardly man, and more). Appearance is everything, and it appears that they did it, and so events are set into motion. I also tend to believe Henry does have the correct memory of the events, and used it to keep control of the group (suggesting that he might've planned Bunny's demise much sooner).

Honestly, I have so many more thoughts and stray questions. The book leaves small hints of certain influences that might have a great impact:

* Henry and his care for plants, even planting the ferns he dug up by the cliffside.
* The implication that Richard comes from an abusive household, which could explain his sometimes passive approach to situations.
* The Greek references that probably flew over my head because I'm just not familiar with all of it.
* Those two months Richard spends freezing in an attic that borders on suicidal.
* The butchered crime investigation which, to me, doesn't seem wholly realistic. Richard wasn't even interviewed *once*? Suddenly everone forgets that Bunny hung around with this tight-knit friend group and it doesn't seem all that important at all once he died.

f5wm9o,Questions on Donna Tartt‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Secret History‚Äô,"WARNING: SPOILERS

I just finished this book at three in the morning and....wow. That‚Äôs really all I can think to say. This was one of those books that leave me feeling sort of melancholy and empty, knowing I‚Äôll never find anything like it again.

I do have a couple questions I‚Äôm curious about, though, that I wasn‚Äôt able to find an answer on. Firstly, I wondered while reading if Richard‚Äôs multiple description of Camilla being ‚Äúboyish‚Äù had any significance. The second thing is, during the scene where it‚Äôs revealed that Charles and Camilla are intimately involved, Richard notices that Camilla adds sugar to her tea which is unusual. I wasn‚Äôt able to figure out what this meant. She showed no outward emotion, so was this change in her behavior an indicator that she was upset? What do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/f5wm9o/questions_on_donna_tartts_the_secret_history/,2020-02-18T18:50:57Z,11,25,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

khvhmn,After rereading The Secret History for the ninth time....,"Does anyone else miss Bunny? When I read the parts after they killed him I became terribly sad, and I can‚Äôt quite figure out if it‚Äôs because I genuinely loved him as a character or if because I know the remaining characters disintegrate after his death. 

After they kill Bunny, the groups problems should be gone but tensions build higher and higher until REALLY horrible things happen. I can‚Äôt figure out if I was sad rereading those parts because I knew the bad things that killing Bunny would bring on for them or if because I was sad Bunny died. 

I would also like to applaud Donna Tartt for being an amazing writer for certain parts where Richard is retelling the story and says stuff like he would wish nothing more for Bunny to be alive and to step in here right now and say something, or when he and Charles were talking and Bunny laughed and that laugh still haunts him today, or when he is retelling stories of Bunny being a shitty friend to him and teasing him about money or his clothes but that he still can‚Äôt find an ounce of anger for Bunny and that he just missed him. 

I also have a question for you guys, who do you think was the villain (for lack of a better word) in the story? I know it‚Äôs a very elementary question and not every book has a villain exactly. In my opinion, I think Julia could be the ‚Äúvillain‚Äù, since he is the teacher and they all seem terribly infatuated and in love with him. He obviously holds quite a hold over all his students and he definitely didn‚Äôt tell them to kill the farmer or Bunny but he does leave them to deal with their own stuff. Some people could also say Bunny was the villain, or Henry, or even Charles. 

I also find it interesting that this book mirrors what Donna Tartt went through at Bennington College. In a few articles I read about her, I pieced together that she also studied classics under an enigmatic professor who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt seem to like women much‚Äù (quote from a classmate). Donna was his only female student and she became extremely good friends with an older classmate who let her live in NYC with him after college without paying rent as she finished the rest of her book which was called ‚ÄúGod of Illusions‚Äù at the time. 

She also attended school with Bret Eston Ellis, and the two were really good friends. The book is also dedicated to him and a man called Paul McGloin, she called a maecenas and muse. The story is told first person, from Richards point of view, and the person he admires most that is not even Julian, but Henry. He is in awe of Henry for most of the book, even in the end and it is always Henry to him, that is the smartest, most respected, etc. 

In the article I read about Donna Tartt, her classmate also said that teacher student relationships were always closer at Bennington College than other schools but the professor who taught Classics to Donna and the other select few were extremely close and if anyone ever criticized him in Donna‚Äôs presence, she would glare at them.

z51qxt,"Bunny in ""The Secret History"" (Closeted Homo/Bisexual with internalized homophobia because of upbringing, or not?"" (spoilers?????)","(quotes marked as spoilers, just in case.)

I'm about 60 pages (page 57) into ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt, and am loving it! But something caught my attention---not something too much about the book, but something about Bunny himself. I feel like I may just be overthinking this, but my gaydar is around 50% for him. I feel like Bunny may be a closeted bisexual/gay, or maybe in the slightest bi/homo-curious man; but the part that gets me is his homophobic remarks, and the way that the waiter looks at him (like it's happened before, or he's heard something about Bunny).

He talks about Charles in away that started this question in my head, >!""Charles is a handsome fellow and a sterling character all around,"" but then he backtracks---""But I wouldn't want to marry him, would I?"" !<Yes, this is a way of comparing him with Camilla, but he also talks about Henry in somewhat of a similar way, and refers to him (Henry) as a >!""hard fellow to live with.""!< His (Bunny's) manners, I think, make it a bit more believable: his almost obnoxiously playful manner, >!his seemingly indifferent attitude toward Camilla's looks, when Papen seems to be completely head over heels for her,!< (or the stereotype of the twentieth and early twenty-first century, of queer people being only in love with clothing and appearance, >!hence the passage of Bunny's letter to Papen about a tie---""p.s. wear a Tie. I am Sure you would have anyway but they will drag some godawful one out of the back and meke (s.p.) you Wear it if you Dont."")!<

At the same time, Bunny makes homophobic remarks about how homosexuals >!love working at restaurants and ""love food"" (once he finds out that their waiter is staring at him; the book states that he was probably planning on saying something more offensive). He wonders if it's something psychological!<. Though as Bunny is around 20 or 21, and this story all takes place (I assume) around the early-mid eighties, that would place his birth in the early-mid sixties, a time where America was still stiffly conservative, but transitioning into a more loose and fun-loving country.

So could Bunny possibly be gay or bisexual (or just curious), with some doubts and projections of homophobia because of environment, or am I just reading too far into this? Or is he just a flat out homophobe?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/z51qxt/bunny_in_the_secret_history_closeted_homobisexual/,2022-11-26T07:51:31Z,2,0,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
izmml5,"The Secret History, Dionysus, and the Supernatural"," ‚ÄúI hope we're all ready to leave the phenomenal world, and enter into the sublime?‚Äù

So begins the looming presence of Julian Morrow, the figure who in many ways initiates the action of Donna Tartt's *The Secret History*, a murder mystery in reverse: The culprits and the victim are revealed immediately.  Over the course of the first half of the novel, the motive is revealed.  In the second half, the fallout.  But lingering, unanswered, is the question of the supernatural. 

Julian is described, frequently, as a pagan.  He has a ""gloomy"" pagan view of death, not merely denying the resurrection of the dead but finding its description, and hopeful aspirations, as somewhat inappropriate for a funeral.  When told that the victim Bunny is becoming enthralled with religion, he describes ""the Roman church"" as a formidable and worthwhile enemy, but shows contempt for ""Presbyterians,"" which is probably, more than anything else, an indication that he values beauty above all else.  After all, the Roman church is, at least, sensual and embodied in a way that most Protestant forms of the Christian religion are not. It is also probable that his elitism is attributed to this same paganism, a point, like the book's treatment of Dionysian ecstasy, that may be ahistorical.  

In the end though, this book leaves the supernatural ambiguous, but at least possible.  Ghosts haunt the narrator, literally in the form of Henry especially, to a lesser extent Bunny.  And of course, the question of the bacchanal.  Whether or not something truly supernatural, otherworldly, whether it happened or not, is left in some sense unanswered.  

It was a joy to read this book again.  I rarely re-read books.  Once done, they are usually not revisited.  I devoured this book again, in about the same space of time as I did the first time (a few days).  But as we enter Halloween season, where the border between the living and the dead is supposedly thin, I thought it fair to ask: 

Is the supernatural real in The Secret History? Indeed, is Dionysus real? Or is this just a figment of the imaginations, run wild, of these Greek language students?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/izmml5/the_secret_history_dionysus_and_the_supernatural/,2020-09-25T16:26:42Z,2,36,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

ts70zl,Non fiction reader‚Äôs (in both senses of the phrase) thoughts on The Secret History by Donna Tartt.,"As the title states, I don‚Äôt read a lot of fiction. I felt like dipping my toes back into it a little and picked up The Secret History because it is so frequently recommended. 

Overall I found the book provocative and engaging, but as is so often the case the end didn‚Äôt quite deliver on the promises of the buildup. I realize that a major theme of the book is the feeling like an isolated outsider looking in and by not showing everything that happened with the ritual, with Julian, with Henry/Camilla the reader is feeling this right alongside Richard. I can appreciate this from a writing perspective, but it still leaves me unsatisfied.

This is especially true because of the length of the book. It was longer than it needed to be and I couldn‚Äôt help but wondering towards the end, as Richard started more and more to say that he couldn‚Äôt remember specific details, that the length was getting away from the author. The sheer number of mentions of cigarettes (153! according to my kindle search function) and drinking was grating, but then that too, I suppose, was the point. 

Maybe it‚Äôs just because I don‚Äôt read a lot of fiction but I sensed many associations (homages?) to the classic 20th century novels I‚Äôd been assigned in high school (Gatsby, Catcher, Lord of the Flies) 

Bunny calling everyone ‚Äúold man‚Äù was reminiscent of Gatsby‚Äôs ‚Äúold sport‚Äù and his obsession with wealth and pretending to be higher class adds to this association. 

Similarly, Richard gave me a lot of angsty Holden Caulfield vibes. I was waiting for him to actually call the vapid Judy Poovey ‚Äúphony‚Äù and by the end he realizes that his friends were just as phony too. He also narrates from some time after the dramatic events of the story, much as Holden does. 

The similarities to Lord of the Flies are obvious. The characters are no longer adolescents and they‚Äôre not on a literal island, but they are still young and are isolated from their peers. Obviously they also turn to some dark deeds in this isolation. 

Did you also find yourself making these comparisons? Are there others that I missed? 

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm happy that I dipped my toe back into fiction a little bit. Despite the frustrations, it was a nice break to get out of my own head and to see somebody else‚Äôs inner monologue for a while.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ts70zl/non_fiction_readers_in_both_senses_of_the_phrase/,2022-03-30T13:57:11Z,9,13,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
ldwcyz,The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion with No Name,"Where my ancient history nerds at?? Just finished this book, and wow! Loved it!!! 

Muraresku is a wonderful writer. The premise of the book explores the links between the Ancient Greek & Eleusinian Mysteries, and the dawn of Christianity. He delves *very* deep into the history of the Eucharist and other psychedelic/ritualistic potions (wine and beer, specifically) that were used by ancient cultures all the way up through the Greeks. Super fascinating read, especially if you‚Äôre into, dare I say, ‚Äúalternative‚Äù, or at the very least, non-mainstream views on religions. But even that description doesn‚Äôt do it justice, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs even the best way to describe it. Nevertheless, Muraresku did some outstanding research for this book, and gives lots of evidence to support his thesis. He ends every chapter with these perfect one or two liners describing his traveling experience and who he‚Äôs about to meet up to have an exciting conversation with, and every time it left me smiling and curious to start the next chapter. 

The similarities between Dionysus and Jesus are really quite astounding. I would be very curious to hear what some of the more moderate or open-minded Christians or Catholics make of this book, and if it has had any kind of impact on how they view their faith, or at least the origins of their faith.

7pshoz,"Thoughts on ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tarry?","MEANT DONNA TARTT

Found this book randomly in a thrift store for 50 cents and didn't know till afterwards how popular it was when it came out.
 
*SPOILERS*
Just finished and overall thought it was really good. Had some issues with long sections where it lagged, main character motivation to help after the first murder seemed weak, the reveal of Henry's character towards the end being like a sociopath, and some odd tangents and details that seemed totally unnecessary (Charles getting a cat at the end, the random characters Tartt tried to talk about at end who I had no idea who they were)

However, the writing is excellent and flows nicely. The deep knowledge of Greek lit and poetry was a nice addition. I love/hated all the snobby rich kids. The development of these perfect beings slowly revealing their deep and tragic flaws was so well done. And I think if you have even a basic knowledge of Greek myth and literature (which is all I do) you can get a little extra out of it. Like the beginning telling you the death of  bunny like Greek tragedies, the twins ""relationship"" being very Greek, the mentor-student relationship of Henry and Julian loving each other, and even the contradictory nature of homosexuality in their culture and this book. 

Very much enjoyed it and looking forward to reading more Tartt books. What are everyone's  thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7pshoz/thoughts_on_the_secret_history_by_donna_tarry/,2018-01-11T23:55:57Z,18,14,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

7ixecy,"My thoughts on ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt","[SPOILERS]

I'm not really sure where to start to be honest. The book was absolutely fantastic, if not emotionally draining. I started out in love with the characters but one by one grew to despise them. Their personalities which were initially so bright and fascinating gradually declined like a white tablecloth becoming covered in stains over time, not noticing much difference at first until you compare the before and after. I think, however, that Francis remained a favorite of mine throughout. 

It was interesting to me that the sense of panic and dread that followed the death of Bunny rather than the death of McRee, the farmer. In their eyes, the farmer being killed was an accident that was brought about by their search for the same sensation felt by the ancient Greeks with Dionysus, and while it was unfortunate, that's just how it was. I'm glad that their calm and matter of factness eventually subsided to a scrambling to keep it together with each one falling to pieces over a deliberate act of murder. While I don't condone their murdering of Bunny, I can understand why they did it. Bunny's behavior was so poor that I was almost rooting for them to get it over with the more I read. 

Reading about them trying to cover up their tracks and have things go as seamlessly as possible while trying to maintain their composure and sense of Ancient Greek serenity was an interesting dichotomy. The entire time I got the feeling that they were all people who, while very smart, thought themselves above other people and of a higher standard than most, when in reality they were just another group of stupid kids who killed their friend. This was mentioned later in the book when Richard was talking about how Julian could lift up his pupils and mold them from inferiority to a sense of superiority, and I thought it fitting that when it came to light that his teachings could have been a main cause of the death of two people, one of them being a student of his, it only made sense that the veneer would crack and Julian should tuck and run without a trace. 

I haven't been able to find many posts about this book, but I would love to hear what others think of it. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7ixecy/my_thoughts_on_the_secret_history_by_donna_tartt/,2017-12-10T22:28:30Z,18,22,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

So I've been lurking on r/suggestmeabook for a few months, and on almost every thread there is someone recommanding The Secret History by Donna Tartt as their favourite book of all time, so when I saw it in a second hand bookshop the other day, I HAD to buy it to see what the fuss was all about.

I just started it this week and I'm only at the second chapter but so far I feel like I'm watching the series How to Get Away with Murder. Here are some of the similarities I noticed:

- College setting
- The mysterious and famous teacher who does not abide by the rules and is super innovative in their way to give class
- The five elite students chosen by the teacher and who have private class with him/her
- The murder ""flashback"" at the very beginning of the book/series 
- The new student who is not as rich as the others (""Waitlist""/Richard who's on a scholarship)

And I'm sure I'm missing even more similarities!

It's not possible, one has surely influenced the other?! Or is it a big coincidence?

7x4tl8,The Secret History by Donna Tartt (alternate killer),"[SPOILER]






I just finished this book and I just cant stop thinking about something. For some reason there were little tiny random clues that made it seem like the farmer was actually not killed by them. But the main thing that stuck out to me was the car ride, I think it was Richard and Francis, but they were driving and stopped abruptly. They looked at each other afterwards and declared that they saw a  ""large cat"" with glowing eyes. And Francis mentioned how Catamount meant Cat of the Mountain because there used to be tons of large cats that lived there. Anyway those things led me to believe that the cat could have actually killed the farmer and they were possibly attacked by it to (the mentions of scratches after the incident). But they somehow never think about that. And it just makes it seem like Bunny (although he died for being an annoying person) died for no reason at all. Also the mention of a creature being there with them? It all makes sense, but none of them ever mention this. Or even think that they didn't kill the farmer. But that probably has to do with Henry convincing them that they killed the farmer. He was always silently manipulating people and acting nonchalant. Fucking annoying prick.

‚Ä¢What was the purpose of Richard's winter interlude? To show the lengths he was willing to go to keep his lie? To have him become further isolated, and thus further covetous of Henry & Co.'s friendship?

‚Ä¢Do you think Henry's suicide was pre-meditated? He was so fastidious in every aspect of his life, but his suicide happened so suddenly--do you think he had planned to do this at one point if any of them went off the deep end after Bunny's murder?

dtf6y1,"The tug-of-war between ""critical"" deconstructionist hot takes and art appreciation in Donna Tartt's The Secret History.","I will admit to some bias - *The Secret History* has, for almost exactly a decade, been one of my favorite books. It is a novel that I often reflect on as though it contained the memories of my own life. A book that on occasion I will leaf through or re-read, and ever notice something entirely new. Like many of Donna Tartt's fans (a word that is quite relevant to this discussion), I stumbled on *The Secret History*, many years ago, quite by accident, in the bookshelf of an extended family member's seaside summer home. Upon reading it, I was quite naturally entranced, much like the protagonist, by superficial details: the antiquated prose. The elaborate sartorial choices of the protagonists. The architecture and trappings of their surroundings in a small liberal arts college.

On a re-read, however, there was one theme in particular that had struck me, and that I had missed prior: though the novel's narrative itself ultimately deconstructs the protagonist's blind appreciation for his peers, it never loses his sense of appreciation. More to the point of this theme, the backdrop portrays a fight in the background between two scholars, the protagonist's mentor Julian Morrow and his initial advisor, the Foucauldian Georges Laforgue (in fact, the character's description is such that he might as well *be* an American Foucault).\*

Why is this significant? This is significant because one of the book's themes is the question of whether or not art should be appreciated for its inspirational value, or endlessly deconstructed and criticized as problematic and reflective of discursive bias. This is a theme that is particularly worth reflecting on given the relatively recent passing of Harold Bloom, who, like *The Secret History*'s Julian Morrow, advocated appreciation in the humanities over criticism, rather than Foucauldian extremes of deconstruction. The text of *The Secret History*, through the lens of the protagonist, whose studies in the Classics are about as traditional and old-fashioned as one can get, remains thoroughly sympathetic to the notion of art (or literary) appreciation, often using deconstructive approaches as a source of mockery or parody.

At the book's tragic conclusion\*\*, however, cracks begin to show in the armor of tradition, and the protagonist acknowledges that all was not as it was cracked up to be - while retaining a sense of appreciation even for the value of his own problematic constructed ""narrative"" the whole time, never sinking into extremes of throwing the baby out with the bathwater due to essentialist generalizations.

\*Another novel that engages in this discourse in a similar setting, albeit in a somewhat more clunky manner, is *The Marriage Plot* by Jeffrey Eugenides. 

\*\*Per classical definitions of tragedy, the protagonist (""tragic hero"") survives and learns something new from the fate of other characters.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dtf6y1/the_tugofwar_between_critical_deconstructionist/,2019-11-08T13:07:30Z,2,11,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
lk5zs5,just finished reading the secret history by donna tart and i had a couple questions that i wanted to know other‚Äôs thoughts on :),"
1. what was the point of the excessive roman catholic symbolism throughout the novel? originally i thought that it was to showcase that they were all sinners or the general aestheticism of the catholic church or maybe even because of the church‚Äôs long history fighting paganism (which julian and the rest closely align themselves with). however, the topic is mentioned a lot throughout the book (bunny‚Äôs bigotry, julian‚Äôs comments to richard at their lunch, francis talking about the sorrowful mysteries, the ash wednesday mass in the epilogue, etc.) and i think it has a greater significance than what i‚Äôm picking up on


2. do you guys think they actually killed the vermont farmer themselves? i know it says throughout the book henry is a big guy, but the farmer‚Äôs death in the newspaper sounds way too brutal to be done without a weapon even if the guy was big. Charles‚Äô also had that unexplained bite mark on him afterwards. again, when francis and richard are driving they see glowing eyes in the woods (like a mountain lion). maybe i‚Äôm totally overanalyzing here but they‚Äôre near the catskills mountains (cats-kill, maybe a play on words?) again idk if i‚Äôm reading way to much into this but the original killing doesn‚Äôt make sense to me and the way tartt uses subtle details throughout the book makes me question this.

i could be totally overanalyzing on both of these but i‚Äôm curious to see what everyone else thinks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lk5zs5/just_finished_reading_the_secret_history_by_donna/,2021-02-15T04:49:14Z,5,14,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

The recommend-er was a huge fan of the book, but when she learned I wasn't loving it she basically refused to discuss it with me.  My negativity toward the book comes from my lack of sympathy for the protagonist or any of the other main characters.

11kie15,I just finished ‚ÄúIT‚Äù and got chills as I closed the book,"I will admit that I have read a lot of it within the last day or so (at some point this weekend, I recognized that I was on page 900 and grew excited as I realized I was getting closer and closer to the end of the book.) This is the longest story I have ever read. I found myself genuinely caring about all of the characters - I must admit that as I was reaching the end, I did start to feel that it was dragging on somewhat, and that the infamous scene stopped me in my tracks (I was giggling uncomfortably whilst reading the infamous scene. I still can‚Äôt believe that that was published.) I have seen the films before, but the book is (unsurprisingly) far better. I must admit that I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of Adult Bill (if I were to explain why, I suppose that that would be a spoiler.) This is easily one of the strangest stories I‚Äôve ever read, and yet it was such a page turner. A part of me can‚Äôt quite believe that I am done with it - I want to read more about the Losers Club and their escapades, to know more somehow about Pennywise.

I successfully completed ‚ÄúThe Secret History‚Äù about four-five months ago, and have now read a novel that was over 1,000 pages. I can certainly see why this story was a bestseller.

152m624,Should I give up reading the classics?,"I guess I should give some context. I‚Äôm currently 18 years old and for the past two or so years I have dappled in the world of classics and for the most part, I have enjoyed it (especially ‚ÄòThe Picture Of Dorian Gray‚Äù, ‚ÄòPride and Prejudice‚Äô, ‚ÄòEmma‚Äô, ‚ÄòFrankenstein‚Äô etc).

However recently I tried tackling Anna Karenina and honestly I did find it interesting but still had a hard time fully immersing myself into it and at around page 300 I got too distracted and instead picked up ‚ÄòThe Secret History‚Äô (which I absolutely loved and as a result I have led myself into a Donna Tartt spiral as I‚Äôm currently reading ‚Äòthe Goldfinch‚Äô). But my struggle with classics isn‚Äôt just a recent thing, as being assigned classics, such as Dracula, also highlighted my struggle as I barely made it through Dracula without falling asleep. 

The problem is that, I know a lot of the classics are more long winded and I wish I could find classics such as Tolstoy‚Äôs and Dostoevsky‚Äôs work mesmerising but I just don‚Äôt think I have that skill yet (at least not now, maybe when I‚Äôm older). 

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say in a long winded way is: should I keep trying my luck with the classics or just admit that I may not be someone who can admire them?

Edit: I‚Äôm so grateful for all the encouragement and reassurance!! Also thanks for all the book recommendations, I‚Äôve put them all into a TBR list and over the next few year I‚Äôll try and put a dent in it!

I heard about it through the Discover section on the Goodreads app and it was specifically recommended for being popular on ""booktok."" I don't have Tiktok, but I've been aware of this book community for a while, because it's mentioned in reviews, there are sections in bookstores designated to it, and I frequent online spaces like this community.

Anyway, this book has outrageously high reviews, and it's fucking awful. I almost gave up finishing it so many times but after paying $19.99 for it, I was damn sure going to get to the end.

‚ÄîThis book is a BLATANT ripoff of The Secret History by Donna Tartt, but with subpar prose and one-dimensional characters. It has the same plot, the same characters, and a practically identical setting.

‚ÄîShakespeare should be listed as a co-author of this book, because the amount of material that was lifted from his texts was ridiculous. There were multiple unnecessarily long ass scenes depicting Shakespeare's plays as the main characters acted them out and an egregious amount of the text was just dialogue from his works. These scenes were boring as fuck and masturbatory. We get it, ML Rio, you studied Shakespeare. The characters also have a supremely annoying habit of quoting Shakespeare in practically every (not an exaggeration) regular conversation they have.

‚ÄîThis has to be the most male-gazey book I've ever read by a woman. I was stunned when I found out the author isn't a man. There is way too much attention on the physical appearances of female characters, ESPECIALLY Meredith. Meredith's two traits are being hot and being a whore (it's what everyone sees her as, including her own friends). Every time she appears, we need another reminder that she's sexy. We got it the first 10 times, thanks. The main character's sister has an eating disorder and this is treated as something she should be mocked for. In fact, the protagonist DOES mock her for it in an argument, and keep in mind that his one personality trait is being ""nice.""

‚ÄîThe big ""revelation"" (if you have zero braincells or reading comprehension skills, that is) has to do with the fact that the protagonist is in love with his male best friend. The author does that annoying thing where she dangles the possibility of a homosexual romance in front of the audience, but she isn't brave enough to go all the way, and I'm not talking about sex scenes. In fact, she's not even brave enough to just call the characters what they are: bisexual. Instead we get stupid phrases like ""sexually amphibious"" and ""a love that transcends gender."" The author wants to play around with a LGBTQ story but she's too cowardly to explicitly call them what they are.

‚ÄîEvery character has one personality trait, including one whose defining trait is not having a personality. She's part of this group of ""friends"" but is hardly ever mentioned and the others don't even know basic facts about her, like what state she lives in. It feels like ML Rio couldn't juggle all her characters, and when she remembered that this one existed, she went back and added sentences here and there to explain why she's never mentioned even though she's apparently there most of the time.

‚ÄîThe characters are all unlikable and annoying. They're so unlikable that it's almost impressive. The thing is, most of them aren't supposed to come across that way. They're also not the fun kind of unlikable character whose adventures you want to follow even though they suck as people -- they're the kind who are so annoying that you repeatedly put the book down because you can't stand to be with them for long stretches of time.

‚ÄîThe big ""murder mystery"" is extremely predictable. I knew who was going to die and who the killer was like two chapters into this thing, and by extension it was very easy to figure out why the protagonist spent time in jail.

‚ÄîThere are extremely stupid things thrown into the book, like the killer faking his suicide a few years before the book's present-day events. The protagonist already took the fall for you and served years in prison for the murder. Literally nobody is looking for you. Dumbass.

I'll stop there. I just needed to get this rant out of my system. From now on, seeing that a book is popular on ""booktok"" is going to put it on my Probably Total Shit list.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17gkrdm/if_we_were_villains_is_terrible_its_the_first/,2023-10-26T01:18:32Z,519,2244,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
17z1870,This is How You Lose the Time War - I loved it but I understand why some hate it,"After giving This is How You Lose the Time War a five star review, I started scrolling through other reviews and I found thoughtful, well reasoned arguments for the other side. This is a thoroughly crafted well written book that is not going to be to everyone's taste. 

The premise is two opposing secret agents, saboteurs, time and history manipulators who work for conflicting civilizations become aware of each other and start to exchange letters.  It becomes a love story. 

The nature of the work each main character does to manipulate history across many centuries and many parallel universes makes the narrative confusing. I can't imagine it done effectively any other way, but I also like other confusing time shifting stories where the story starts to make sense later. 

The characters only meet through their letters with a couple of exceptions, so some say the love story is unbelievable. For me, it reflects the extreme isolation and loneliness of their work and how even minimal tenuous companionship of a peer would satisfy a gaping need. 

The writing includes extravagant romantic feelings and poetic literary allusions to go with the science fiction and time travel aspect. I appreciated it, but people who like romance and  poetry don't always like science fiction and time travel and vice versa. 

The authors lean into the epistolary format. It's not exclusively letters but a significant percentage of the writing is the letters these two characters exchange. 

This book reminds me of some classic  novels that also are somewhat polarizing. 

>!Romeo and Juliet, (I know a play), Tale of Two Cities, O Henry Gift of the Magi!<

The creative forms the letters take were fun for me and seemed like a valid extrapolation of actual historical spycraft if you assumed much greater ability to manipulate matter. However some people find them over the top. 

It is an exuberant, enthusiastic book that is fun if you like it and possibly cringy if you don't",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17z1870/this_is_how_you_lose_the_time_war_i_loved_it_but/,2023-11-19T16:45:54Z,100,348,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

basically what the title says. I think Donna Tartt is criminally underrated and one of the best authors of the 21st century. What do you think? I have read both Secret History and The Goldfinch and think that she is absolutely exceptional.

I have found that not many people i know have read her books or heard of her. While she did get quite a lot of props for the Goldfinch when it won a pulitzer in 2014, she was robbed from any sort of commercial success via the movie.

His dialogue, his little rant in the Amsterdam hotel. Calling out ""Potter"" to Theo. Easily one of, if not my favorite character in a book. I thoroughly enjoyed the entirety of the book as well. 


As I've seen some people mention, that she dragged on a bit in Vegas. But I didn't seem to mind this at all. I liked the Vegas bit. It really solidified their friendship and took it to the next level. Per usual with Tartt, she did drag on a bit when describing smaller details. Like she'd write paragraphs nonstop on how Hobie would repair a certain antique, or other things involving his craft. This would be my only complaint about the book. Otherwise, i loved it. Theo from that day in the museum to the ending felt like such a long ass journey, and I enjoyed every aspect of it. It was a good story involving lots of good characters. I've read The Secret History a while back, but I very much prefer The Goldfinch. The Secret History is a better book I'd say, but I like the Goldfinch better. If that makes any sense.

14f7c6w,How I solved ‚ÄòThe Library of Babel',"OK, that title's meant as slightly tongue-in-cheek, I don‚Äôt think the Library in Borges‚Äôs short story is something that's meant to be *solved* per se*,* like some puzzlebook. But I *do* think I‚Äôve discovered something in the story, a secret miracle, which I believe may well have been  Borges's (secret) aim with it, a kinda demonstration by example. 

If anyone wants to [read the whole thing](https://mazinsaleem.substack.com/p/how-i-solved-the-library-of-babel), you can find it here, posted here in good faith, ‚Äúto encourage in-depth discussion about all things related to books‚Äù - and written for nothing but love of the short story and Borges.

In any case, here‚Äôs a summary of my findings:

1. 'The Library of Babel‚Äô is about a library that, while not infinite, is stupendously vast, in order to contain the total of all possible book generated according to a set off given parameters. Nearly every such book would be seeming gibberish. The narrator of the story offers as an example of rare, legible but ultimately inscrutable text ever found in the Library the phrase ‚ÄòO Time thy pyramids.'
2. I discovered the real-world origin of the phrase (and then in writing my piece, learnt a few others had a similar inkling too tho it‚Äôs only been conjecture so far).
3. Question is, why would Borges secrete this literary reference into the story, when the other references are explicit? as an easter egg? a private joke?
4. Consider that the narrator longs / hopes that someone will find the justification of the Library (""let his place be heaven even though my own place be hell."")
5. Now, I think I've discovered that Borges also obliquely mentioned where ‚ÄòO time thy pyramids' is located in the Library by giving us its circuit number.
6. That number, as I hope I show, is when Borges estimates the phrase was written in real literary history.
7. Considering that those words ‚ÄòO Time thy pyramids' could've been anywhere in a library that's many many times bigger than our own universe, then the chances it would be in a circuit number the same as the year it was written are vanishingly small.
8. It's in fact miraculous: a hint of divine design in seeming chaos, just what the narrator had longed for.
9. What's the point of this secret miracle then? a) The source of the reference reinforces the idea that the Library is a metaphor for time: arbitrary, random, falsely novel, neverchanging. The Library/time/the universe conceived of this way - as predestined, total, eternal, arbitrary -""annuls"" the librarians, dismays them. But the secret miracle shows it's not arbitrary after all. They, like the narrator, like us readers, just never noticed it.
10. So but then why did Borges make this all so secret? Because I believe the reader was meant to overlook the ‚Äòmiracle' in the same way that the narrator longed for a divine justification to the Library, but overlooked one that was right in front of him. Which would make 'The Library of Babel‚Äô a unique example, I think, in literature where the whole aesthetic and metaphysical point is for the reader to not even realise they missed something.

Anyway, I had fun writing this up, hope anyone who‚Äôs interested will have fun joining me down the rabbit-hole too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14f7c6w/how_i_solved_the_library_of_babel/,2023-06-21T13:09:45Z,53,31,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

uxbk7k,Disappointed by The Atlas Six,"I recently started The Atlas Six after reading such rave reviews about it, so I was pretty excited. I'm also a huge fan of dark academia (never the same after reading The Secret History). I'm around the part where all the characters are all gathered together for the first time. But anyways, I'm actually having a really hard time getting into it? I feel like the author didn't do a good job of setting the story up. I'm confused about everyone's powers and the world they live in, and I don't particularly like any of the characters.

nwzjl1,Does anyone remember ‚ÄúThe Secrets of Droon‚Äù?,"It‚Äôs baffling to me how history seems to have forgotten this epic fantasy chapter book series by Tony Abbott. There were 44 of them! Maybe I‚Äôm crazy, but I have to think there‚Äôs more people out there who remember this series‚Ä¶ right? Just hear my melodramatic self out.

So, these books were released throughout the entirety of the 2000s. They were up there with A to Z Mysteries, Bailey School Kids, and Magic Treehouse, at least at my library. Except this was straight-up fantasy, trying to rival the likes of Harry Potter but even younger target demographics.

You followed the standard 3 kid protagonists (Eric, Julie, Neal) as they accidentally stumble into an entire fantasy-based alternate reality through Eric‚Äôs basement. And then later on they get changed/corrupted/cursed over the long-term series in a weird choice of actual continuity for a children‚Äôs book series. I don‚Äôt think it ever went as dark as Animorphs, because who could, but it was closer than most. But there was a steady progression of plot and some weird twists judging by the short Wikipedia synopsis and my own scattered memories. Hella time manipulation, shapeshifters, wizards,  sorcerers, genies, dragons, evil selves, pillow people‚Ä¶ I give up, there‚Äôs too much and half of it wouldn‚Äôt make sense out of context to list because, you know, fantasy.

It‚Äôs a bit of a fever dream to be honest. 

And the more I try to look into the series, the stranger it gets. Virtually every single book in the series has a 4/5 on goodreads; perhaps that‚Äôs normal, but I find it eerie. There‚Äôs a subreddit for the book series‚Ä¶ with only 1 post. Ever. [And it seems to echo my sentiments here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/droon/comments/jb8i4c/anyone_else_feel_like_secrets_of_droon_was_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) There‚Äôs also only one thread on r/books when I search the title. The fanbase is nonexistent. If I didn‚Äôt know better, I‚Äôd say someone is purposely shoving Secrets of Droon into obscurity.

So, why am I making this post? I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs kinda cathartic I guess. I just want to know if anyone ever thinks about this series, remembers anything, perhaps a reason why it‚Äôs remembered the way it is (which is it‚Äôs not). Maybe I should just reread it myself. 

Regardless, thanks.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who commented for being part of this little time capsule, evidence of Secrets of Droon etched into the internet at last. I‚Äôm glad to know I wasn‚Äôt the only one thinking about these books.

19ai6fg,The Whispering Shadows,"In the heart of the city, there stood an imposing office building with a haunting history. Jake, a young employee seeking success, found himself working late one fateful night, surrounded by the eerie silence of the deserted office._x000D_  
_x000D_  
As the clock ticked away, shadows seemed to detach themselves from the walls, slowly encircling Jake's solitary desk. Unsettling whispers echoed through the dimly lit corridors, telling tales of long-forgotten miseries and lost souls condemned to the office after dark._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Jake, consumed by an impending deadline, dismissed the whispers as figments of his imagination. Yet, the shadows persisted, growing darker and more malevolent with every passing moment. The office, once a symbol of corporate ambition, transformed into a sinister realm where the boundary between the living and the dead blurred._x000D_  
_x000D_  
In a desperate attempt to escape the encroaching darkness, Jake stumbled upon an ancient journal hidden in the office archives. The dusty pages revealed a grim truth - the office was built upon an ancient burial ground, and the spirits of the restless dead sought retribution._x000D_  
_x000D_  
As the whispers intensified, Jake frantically searched for a way to appease the vengeful spirits. Unearthed blueprints hinted at a forgotten chamber beneath the office, a place of dark rituals and unfinished business. Armed with newfound knowledge, Jake descended into the subterranean labyrinth, guided by the haunting whispers that seemed to beckon him._x000D_  
_x000D_  
In the depths of the office's dark secret, Jake encountered the lingering souls of disgruntled employees, their faces contorted in eternal anguish. To free them and himself from the spectral torment, Jake had to confront the malevolent force that bound them to the accursed office._x000D_  
_x000D_  
As he delved deeper, the whispers escalated into agonizing screams, reverberating through the unearthly chamber. In a climactic confrontation, Jake faced the embodiment of the office's dark history - a shadowy entity that thrived on the suffering of those who dared to step into its realm._x000D_  
_x000D_  
With a newfound courage, Jake unearthed a relic hidden within the chamber, a talisman that held the key to breaking the curse. As he shattered the talisman, a blinding light enveloped the office, banishing the shadows and releasing the tormented souls._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Gasping for breath, Jake found himself back at his desk, the office now bathed in the pale light of dawn. The whispers had ceased, and the haunting shadows had retreated. Although he had escaped the clutches of the supernatural, the horror of that night lingered in his mind, a chilling reminder of the spectral secrets that lurked within the seemingly ordinary confines of office life._x000D_

10jgide,The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt - a tale of two halves,"I‚Äôve been a fan of Donna Tartt since being enamored by The Secret History many years ago, so I went into The Goldfinch with pretty high expectations ‚Äì especially given the book‚Äôs hype and awards pedigree.

Overall, I really enjoyed the book, and there are sections where it‚Äôs downright incredible. It never fully comes together for me as a masterpiece, but it‚Äôs a compelling, immersive story nonetheless.

The first 2/3rds of the book are where it really shines. I‚Äôve seen it being described as Dickensian, and that‚Äôs wholly appropriate. Theo‚Äôs journey, starting from when his mother passes in the terrorist attack, to his stay with the Barbours, and his eventual sojourn into the desert in Vegas, were riveting. Tartt does such an amazing job of capturing how unmoored and lost Theo is, and what it means for a traumatized child to go through their formative years without any kind of compass. The book was really shaping up to be a full-on 5/5 read when it focused on Theo‚Äôs teenage years. I loved his strange, complicated relationship with Boris, two misfit souls who couldn‚Äôt be more different still finding comfort and solace in each other (more on this later). The final section of this part, following Theo‚Äôs escape from his dad‚Äôs house and his bus journey from Vegas to NYC, was particularly captivating. It was just suffused with so much tension and anxiety.

Unfortunately, it falters quite a bit after the 8-year time jump. The last third of the book, once it starts focusing more on The Goldfinch painting and the whole art crime underworld, is just‚Ä¶a little boring, if I‚Äôm being honest. It honestly feels a little tacked on and detached from everything that went on before it. Which brings me to my next issue with the book ‚Äì it‚Äôs too damn long. It could‚Äôve easily been trimmed by at least a 100-150 pages without losing any meat. The final section in Amsterdam seemed especially turgid and dragging. And for all that, the ending felt weirdly rushed and anticlimactic, and it felt like we didn‚Äôt get any resolution to some important character relationships. I would‚Äôve liked to see a little bit more with Theo‚Äôs relationship with Kitsey and Pippa, specifically. The second-half relationship with Boris also wasn‚Äôt anywhere near as compelling, as Boris only seemed to exist as a plot/exposition device to retrieve the painting.

I‚Äôm also not sure just how thematically important the Goldfinch painting was. Yes, it‚Äôs kind of a symbolic connection Theo has with his mother, but I did feel like the whole ‚Äúart lives on‚Äù thing Donna Tarrtt was espousing at the end was a little forced, especially because the painting didn‚Äôt even factor in throughout much of the plot.

Prose-wise, I don‚Äôt have much to complain about. Tarrtt is an amazing writer for the most part, and there are a ton of beautifully-written passages in the book (although she often tends to be a little overwrought and as I mentioned before, there‚Äôs a lot of fluff throughout the book that I felt could be removed)

Overall though, I did enjoy the book a lot. With a little bit more focus, it could‚Äôve been an instant modern classic like The Secret History (imo). Still very much recommended for a well-written and thoughtful piece of contemporary literature",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10jgide/the_goldfinch_by_donna_tartt_a_tale_of_two_halves/,2023-01-23T16:26:45Z,10,13,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

vdmmhm,Just finished Salt to the Sea by Ruta Sepetys - a book I should have loved and was near universally well-reviewed. Hated it.,"I love historical fiction. Even ""light"" historical fiction. I had this book recommended to me by a half-dozen people. The reviews everywhere were glowing. 4.7 on Amazon. 4.4 on Goodreads. 

I couldn't stand it. 

This history goes through some of the darkest days of human history. Horrific atrocities were committed in a dozen different ways to millions of people. A caravan of human suffering. This should be a slice of history where getting the reader to sympathize with the characters should be effortless. Instead, we're treated to cardboard cutouts. The pretty nurse with the blond curls with a secret. The strapping young soldier with a secret. The innocent mid-teenage girl with a secret. The learned old man to spout little moral quips. It all comes off as so emotionally shallow and one dimensional. I've seen better character development in grocery store romance novels. 

The casualties that happen are... detached. Who cares. It's some background character with no emotional heft. Like the C characters in an action movie that you know are there just to die. The characters are so thing that it's hard to care if they live or die. 

Then there's the structure. It's essentially a ""road"" book, told on one long rather tedious journey filled with pockets of what is supposed to be terror and emotion but never connects. Then you're treated to flashbacks to the good days that is supposed to make you connect with characters, but again, it never did. 

I think the biggest blame for it is the constantly shifting narrative. It's written first-person through the eyes of four main characters, but each chapter is extremely short. One page. Maybe two. Sometimes just a couple of sentences. So you're never given enough time with each character to connect. You're constantly skipping between them, which sometimes can really work to give you two characters' take on the same action. But here, it doesn't, because it's always trying to evoke the same emotional outcome. So it's just unnecessary channel surfing through the book. 

We're supposed to see the scenes of sacrifice as brave. But without a connection to the character, why do we even care? Is Joana the bravest? Emilia? Who cares? And the pink hat constantly threaded throughout? Rebirth. Regeneration. I get it. It was too 'the girl in red' from Schindler's List. Never connected because I never got a chance to connect with the character. 

&#x200B;

Spoilers to follow. 

&#x200B;

>!Easily the worst character is Alfred Frick. Ostensibly, he's supposed to be the ""villain,"" but again, the character is completely empty so he never feels like a genuine threat. Sure, he's some devotee to Hitler who turned in his Jewish obsession to ""save"" her and he's delusional and maybe a sociopath. But he doesn't do anything. And in fact is quite the useful idiot. The big ""showdown"" with him seems unearned and the resolution unsatisfying.  !<

>!The Nazi art theft/amber room subplot was entirely pointless. All it did was inject plot armor so that documents could be forged to get people on the boat. It was a piece of history that I'm guessing Sepetys was interested in it and wanted to look for ways to include it. But it was ham-fisted and incomplete. And in the end, pointless. !<",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vdmmhm/just_finished_salt_to_the_sea_by_ruta_sepetys_a/,2022-06-16T13:57:24Z,21,8,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
12kw9gh,"The Eiger Sanction (1972), by Trevanian, was awesome","I thought it was really fantastic.

Brief description: An assassin is coerced into one last hit.

This was a very fun read. It has discussion of art, architecture, food, history, people's motivations (patriotic whores & selfish killers *vis-a-vis* selfish whores & patriotic killers--you're more likely to survive associations with the former), mountain climbing, weather, geography. I was often looking up words I had never come across and didn't know--always a good sign in a book!

Anyone worried about whether they will be offended should steer clear. Plenty of inappropriate language and scenes, (although no slurs).

Mild spoilers:

18rt393,The Little Friend by Donna Tartt,First off I enjoyed the novel. However I do have some gripes. The book suffers considerably from a lack of commitment to a direction or message. The blurb and prologue lead the reader to think this book is a murder/mystery. Turns out that‚Äôs never what it is. The book is actually a coming of age type story with a small bit of commentary on culture in the Old South. However even those concepts aren‚Äôt explored to a satisfying conclusion. The way the author shows us the decay of the culture of the Old South was some great stuff. However it‚Äôs abandoned with 150 pages left in the book with no real conclusion which is kinda sad. I can‚Äôt help but think of what this book could have been. While Gone with the Wind is a novel that glorifies the Old South through the narrative of a coming of age/love story this book could have shown that same culture for what it truly was through the narrative of a coming of age/murder mystery.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18rt393/the_little_friend_by_donna_tartt/,2023-12-27T05:39:06Z,5,3,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
hvdpge,Thoughts on The Goldfinch?,"I finally read The Goldfinch after many people recommended it to me. I also enjoyed Donna Tartt‚Äôs The Secret History. 

The Goldfinch was a different read though. It‚Äôs slower in a way and grows on you. I also could vividly see New York and the lifestyle Tartt built up. I also love Hobie, he is so precious! It took me awhile to like Boris and by the end I realized he is stubbornly flawed and purposefully so. 

One thing though, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people dislike Theo. Oddly enough, Theo was my favorite character. I related to him and was able to slip into his mind space easily. And I actually enjoyed the hotel scene, Theo‚Äôs internal struggle with his death, his morals, and his mother was well done. I wanted Theo to turn himself in, especially after he finalized his decision and saw his mother.

6riilo,The progression of Donna Tartt's works,"I just finished up The Little Friend by Donna Tartt, and found it really interesting to compare to her other two books, The Goldfinch, and The Secret History. You can sort of feel the tone shift from a fairly character driven, but with noticeable plot elements, story in Secret History, to an almost 100% character driven story in Goldfinch. 

Little Friend seems to slide right in between those two. You can detect some of the longwindedness, and slow, almost meandering, writing and characters that made Goldfinch so rewarding, and for me, difficult, to read. But there is always a little rumble of an overarching plot in the distance, keeping you in the world. There's serious time devoted to both aspects of the story. Enough where it makes sense she only publishes every decade or so. I'm excited to see what direction her next work goes. 

What do you all think? Personally, I found Secret History to be the easiest and most enjoyable (My god the discovery scene is just incredible. One of the best things I've ever read), but I'd love to know your opinions on all her books, as well as her overarching tone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6riilo/the_progression_of_donna_tartts_works/,2017-08-04T05:46:56Z,8,4,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
13e9m1t,The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt,"In spite of its purported nihilism, its thesis is that of a hallmark greeting card: good things can come of bad, life is short and pointless but we must go on, beauty and art are worth dying for.

There's a lot of stuff about choosing to progress up the corporate ladder vs throwing it all away and living free of society's fetters. This is quaint and privileged stuff coming after the 2008 financial crisis. But in Tartt's defense, she does write about privileged people for whom that choice is not necessarily fictitious.

Anyway, I like this book so much even though I kind of wanted to hate it? And then I realized why when I recalled what Orwell said about Dickens: ""all fragments, all details ‚Äî rotten architecture, but wonderful gargoyles."" 

Like Dickens, Tartt is no revolutionary. In the moral philosophy of The Goldfinch, the society we live in and its institutions are fundamentally good, and any bad that happens is because of some amorphous causeless evil. But while I think this is very much a naive navel gazing way to look a things, and the book's plot is silly to the point of incomprehensibility, Tartt's ""gargoyles"" are indeed wonderful.

Not a single character doesn't ring true to type, but my hands down favorite is Xandra. In my mind I envision her physically as a younger Brigitte Macron: tanned, blond, stylish, beady eyed with a snub nose. Cute, sexy, but not exactly conventionally beautiful. I love how resilient Xandra is. In spite of her airhead leathery exterior, she is a good person, really genuine. I can almost taste the fried foods she brings home from her restaurant job. 

I was annoyed by Theo's endless maunderings about Pippa which imo could have been edited and pared down by A LOT. But during Pippa's dinner with Theo, when she talked about her failed ambitions, it was really heartbreaking and so relatable. I wish Tartt had given her more space in the book.

Theo's Dad and Andy's Dad were really helpful to read about. People are conditioned to think of parents as responsible, helpful and loving in relation to their children. But parents are just people with their flaws and pre-existing mental illnesses, criminal dishonesty, love of gambling and disregard for the well being of others including their own children. 

What I found interesting in Tartt's portrayal of Theo's Dad and Andy's Dad is that neither of them are the least bit malicious. Even though they did enormous harm to those around them, it was all unintentional. It is fairly obvious they were barely aware that there are other people in the universe other than themselves. They symbolize the universe itself in their absolute indifference to all and sundry.

Hobie and Mrs. Barbour, as types of the kindly rich, are perfect and adorable. I like how Tartt did not make Mrs. Barbour out to be some ice cold Society bitch. Her vulnerability really comes across. 

I'm conflicted about Boris. Weirdly enough I did know somebody like Boris and Tartt is again on point with her portrayal of Boris and his immigrant crew, imo. But while I was initially amused by Tartt's rendition of Boris' immigrant English, it eventually began to grate on my nerves. Like in the last few chapters when Tartt gave Boris the stage, it was a little too much. A character like Boris is best taken in limited doses, too much of Boris at once makes the book seem fake. I began to see not Boris the person but Donna Tartt the writer reveling in her portrayal of Boris the character. Not good.

The only characters that rang a bit false to me were the doormen at the building where Theo and his mom lived before the accident. They came across as almost like caricatures of the The Kindly Minorities stereotype. It was a bit cringing. 

The plot is ridiculous and I'm inclined to say there was no plot, Tartt was winging it, making shit up as she went along. And this being a Tartt book, we must have our noir references. The shadows converging in on the character as they sit silently freaking out, the cigarette smoke in a dark hotel room, etc. The convoluted plot is also a hallmark of the film noir of the 1940s. The Amsterdam episode where they go to get the painting is a wink-wink-nudge-nudge reference to all the incomprehensible film noir plots that were never intended to make sense. Maybe that kind of thing worked on film or pulp fiction, but in a piece of upscale literary fiction like The Goldfinch, it stood out like a sore thumb. 

So yeah, rotten architecture but wonderful gargoyles. If Tartt was more prolific, she could very well be our very own Dickens. Another similarity to Dickens is that she's one of those writers who improves with age like wine. I loved The Secret History and The Goldfinch is an even greater book than The Secret History. I can't wait to read her next book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13e9m1t/the_goldfinch_by_donna_tartt/,2023-05-11T01:37:55Z,12,19,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

>*Moonglow* unfolds as the deathbed confession of a man the narrator refers to only as ‚Äúmy grandfather.‚Äù It is a tale of madness, of war and adventure, of sex and marriage and desire, of existential doubt and model rocketry, of the shining aspirations and demonic underpinnings of American technological accomplishment at midcentury, and, above all, of the destructive impact‚Äîand the creative power‚Äîof keeping secrets and telling lies. It is a portrait of the difficult but passionate love between the narrator‚Äôs grandfather and his grandmother, an enigmatic woman broken by her experience growing up in war-torn France. It is also a tour de force of speculative autobiography in which Chabon devises and reveals a secret history of his own imagination.

4ci63z,The /r/books bookclub selection for April is Dead Wake by Erik Larson! He will be doing an AMA here on April 27th.,"This month we are excited to be featuring a nonfiction book for the first time! Erik Larson's writing style is very readable so even if you don't read a lot of nonfiction I encourage you to give this a try.

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22551730-dead-wake):

>On May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era‚Äôs great transatlantic ‚ÄúGreyhounds‚Äù‚Äîthe fastest liner then in service‚Äîand her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. 

>Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger‚Äôs U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small‚Äîhubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more‚Äîall converged to produce one of the great disasters of history.

>It is a story that many of us think we know but don‚Äôt, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. 

>Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history.

13vw7a8,"Compared to her other two books, 'The Little Friend' by Donna Tartt is massively overshadowed.","Donna Tartt is undoubtedly one of the most well-renowned and talented writers of this generation. However, all I see is praise for only two of her books, The Goldfinch and The Secret History. I happened to find The Little Friend in Barnes & Noble and give it a go- and honestly, despite popular belief, I thought the book was great. 

It's a grim coming-of-age story set in Mississippi revolving around a girl, Harriet, who sets off with her friend to discover who murdered her brother Robin 12 years ago, who's death left a marked impact on their family. Throughout the story, the narrative switches between her and Danny, a notorious man part of a crime and drug dealing family and who she accuses to be Robin's murderer. Out of her three books, in my opinion, The Little Friend best executes the theme of the discovery of evil and loss of innocence. 

The gradual shift from a kid detective murder-mystery to a bleak, thriller-like novel was astounding. Donna Tartt almost tests our own prejudices by seeing how like Harriet, we assign the guilt of Robin's murder to Danny simply because it makes sense for him to be Robin's murderer, later revealing that he was only a friend of Robin. In a way, Danny and Robin play as a foil for each other- Robin, who was more likely to have led a promising future with loving family and friends, dies- meanwhile Danny, who was abused by his father and raised in a crime filled family is spared by death. The constant subversion of expectations shows Harriet the real, unpredictable chaos that life actually is. She is forced to wake up out of her childlike adventure fantasies and realize- she is not a Sherlock Holmes where she solves the mystery, and the bad guys receive their respective punishment- but in a world where loss is painfully cruel and real, and when a tumble of depressing events pour down on her as she grows up, she is forced to break out of her naive view of the world. 

Overall, The Little Friend was a thrilling read and I believe it deserves to be held in somewhat the same regard as her other books. The murder of Robin which captivates Harriet to set off in an adventure, and the gradual hopelessness of her situation as she grows up, were written beautifully by Donna Tartt and should have better recognition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13vw7a8/compared_to_her_other_two_books_the_little_friend/,2023-05-30T17:18:39Z,17,47,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
1bnre7l,The Garden of Evening Mists by Tan Twan Eng is BEAUTIFUL,"I just finished reading the garden of evening mists and ohmygod how have I not read this before. I feel some sort of void now that can only be filled by talking about it. Absolutely beautiful book, every sentence is so intentionally written, every emotion the author is trying to evoke feels so natural? I devoured every sentence and it was soo worth it. The book itself is so atmospheric and is just such a beautiful discussion of love, nature, memory, loss, history.

I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting an emotional, complex story that deals with the above themes with a super immersive setting and unforgettable charactors.

Malaya, 1951. Yun Ling Teoh, the scarred lone survivor of a brutal Japanese wartime camp, seeks solace among the jungle-fringed tea plantations of Cameron Highlands. There she discovers Yugiri, the only Japanese garden in Malaya, and its owner and creator, the enigmatic Aritomo, exiled former gardener of the emperor of Japan.

Even if you do not often read non fiction I highly recommend this book.  

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks):

>Henrietta Lacks, as HeLa, is known to present-day scientists for her cells from cervical cancer. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells were taken without her knowledge and still live decades after her death. Cells descended from her may weigh more than 50M metric tons. 

>HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb‚Äôs effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks was buried in an unmarked grave.

>The journey starts in the ‚Äúcolored‚Äù ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s, her small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia ‚Äî wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo. Today are stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells, East Baltimore children and grandchildren live in obscurity, see no profits, and feel violated. The dark history of experimentation on African Americans helped lead to the birth of bioethics, and legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.

146p7a,What are your favorite book series that are longer- minimum 5 books in the series,"I know there have been threads about peoples' favorite series before, but this one is for longer ones.  I love nothing more than getting into a great series because who doesn't love a series that keeps you up until the early morning and then makes you get out of bed to find the next one and continue the story.

Here's my list:

* Robert Jordan's (RIP) Wheel of Time.  Really just an epic series coming in at 14 books.  The final novel is set to be released in January.  It got me over my fantasy prejudice.  The first book borrows heavily from Lord of the Rings and the author acknowledged this, but from there, it's pretty original world that he creates.  There's a minor issue in that book 10, Crossroads of Twilight, is pretty slow.  But the series is too good for a single mediocre book to drag it down.  I highly suggest it.  Give it a shot.  Mat Calhoun becomes the best character after being kinda a dick.

* A Song of Ice and Fire.  I don't think that this one really requires an explanation.  Another great fantasy world.  Martin really drags you in with Game of Thrones before putting in any of the weirder, more fantastical elements.

* Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series.  There are 11 original books that take Sharpe through the Spanish Peninsula all the way to Waterloo during the Napoleonic Wars as he fights under Wellington.  Sharpe is a commoner who was jumped up from the ranks and commands a groups of riflemen- skirmishers.  Sharpe is a badass character that is just a ton of fun to read.  Cornwell writes great stories and he does a fantastic job at describing the battles in a way that makes them come alive and also very easy to follow.  The series was popular enough to warrant Cornwell writing 3 prequels of him in India and now there are 24 total Sharpe books.  I recommend to everyone, but I think guys are more likely to like it.

* Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Stories.  Uthred is an Anglo (ok, I'm messing up the term) who is captured by Danes who raise him.  He loves the Danes and follows their beliefs.  But he becomes a warlord of Alfred the Great, who is responsible for creating the idea of England instead of separate kingdoms.  Uthred is another great character.  He's fun to listen to, talks down to the priests (except one or two), creates controversy, and is another badass motherfucker whose exploits are just a ton of fun to follow.

* Conn Iggulden's Conqueror series.  Follows Genghis Khan from childhood, his uniting of the Mongol people, and their conquests.  Later goes on to follow his descendants.  Really good historical fiction.  First book is a tad slow for a little bit, but it picks right up again.  Based heavily on The Secret History of the Mongols.  His Emperor series will be 5 books when the next one comes out, but it's just too fictionalized and untrue to the historical record for my taste.

* Colleen McCullough's Master of Rome Series.  Probably the best historical fiction out there in terms of scholarship, accuracy, and detail.  7 books take you from 110-27 BC.  Very long books that are pretty dense.  But the time period is well documented and she does a great job with it.  There are plenty of real characters that she uses that are all fascinating.

* Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey‚ÄìMaturin series (AKA Master and Commander).  Probably the golden standard of historical fiction.  If you're interested in the British Navy during the time period, this is what you want to read.  Great books.  Must reads.  Hornblower gets a nod, but O'Brian's series is better.

* Simon Scarrow's Eagle series.  Follows a Roman centurion and his optio (think sergeant).  Cato is upjumped as a favor for his father and has to prove himself whereas Macro is a grizzled veteran.  They have enemies within the officer corps of the Roman elite who strive to undermine them.  Two really cool characters that interact well.  The first books start in Britain, but they go all over the Empire.  Pretty good to the historical record for the most part.

* Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series.  Kind of a guilty pleasure of mine.  Rapp is a CIA agent who does the whole counter-terrorism deal.  Lots of stereotypes.  He's a badass.  He hates the red tape and regulations that hold him back from achieving his goals.  All that good stuff.  But the stories are good, plots interesting, and it shits all over something like Dan Brown in terms of a light read that is actually good.

* King's The Dark Tower- 8 books, all really good.  Read it.

I know I'm forgetting a couple so I'll post some more later.  Would like to see what /r/books likes in terms of series and maybe find a new one for when I finish rereading Wheel of Time.

11cr5iy,House of the Spirits chilled me,"I finished this book today (part of my recent kick reading South American magic realism) and got a gut punch from the ending of the novel. One passage in particular hit too close for my recent experience here in the States:

‚ÄúAlba wondered where so many Fascists had come from overnight, because in the country‚Äôs long, democratic history they had not been particularly noticeable, except for a few who got carried away during World War II and thought it amusing to parade in black shirts with their arms raised in salute‚Äîto the laughter and hissing of bystanders‚Äîand had never won any important role in the life of the country. Nor did she understand the attitude of the armed forces, most of whom came from the middle and working class and had traditionally been closer to the left than the far right.‚Äù

In the context of a coup that results in secret police, dictatorship by the military, and the murder and disappearance of thousands, it‚Äôs frightening how fast these folks come out of the shadows. Maybe that element is always within society. 

The ending at least offered a vision of hope that also moved me, but I‚Äôll save that for people who want to read or know how to do spoiler tags lol.

I picked up this book and read it for the first time a month ago. I was immediately sucked into this fun and fast paced quest. Although I don‚Äôt think the book is written exceptionally well, wow it is interesting and such a good time. 

As conspiracy theories are so commonplace in society today, it must have been a real treat to see one so completely fleshed out 20 years ago. The past month has led me to do so much more research about the Priory of Sion, the Church, and of course, the holy grail. I think it is so successful because it gets at the one thing that will always make us tick: not knowing a secret. 

Finally, I watched the movie last week. It was pretty funny how terrible the movie was (and how much it deviated from the best part of the book: the plot itself). Wow, what a mess. 

Anyways, these are just some jumbled thoughts about a now 20 year old awesome story. Please share your experiences and thoughts on the book below!

wf7tu3,"""The Secret Barrister"" an absolute must read","(To be fair I have been listening to the audiobook while at work over the past few days. I unfortunately don't own a physical copy as of yet but I intend to do so.)

""The Secret Barrister"" authored by the same name. Is an absolute must read regardless of how you consume literature and especially if you live in the UK.

It has opened my eyes up to the world of the UK courts, and how the system is both brilliant (when it works), but is in dire need of more funding, training, and appreciation.

I haven't taken much interest into how the law works, I tend to stick to my interests of geography, history and the like. But this book has completely opened my eyes to the system and how the mindset ""it won't happen to me"" is both detrimental to yourself and the courts when it calls onto you in whatever form that may be.

I have seen that there are two more books by the Secret Barrister which I aim to read, but this is truly an eye opener on the system and I implore anyone that is; interested in law, wants to dip there toes into the topic, or lives in the UK to read this book.

If anyone else has also read this book what do you think about it?

The most thought provicking moment is when the author quotes ""What about our statistics?"", it really made me think is the UK system really simply reduced just to numbers over what is justice?.

dubo3h,Does anyone find fiction less enjoyable the more they age?,"I use to be easily impressed when I was a teenager. It‚Äôs embarrassing to say but I use to love twilight when I was 12 and it‚Äôs what got me into reading. And when I was 13 I fell in love with Harry Potter like everyone else. For the majority of my high school life I only read YA, but suddenly I stopped enjoying it when I was around 17. I just couldn‚Äôt relate anymore. I was no longer impressed with the storylines and I couldn‚Äôt stand the romance, so I moved on to classics and other genres. I enjoyed Jane Eyre, Wuthering heights, North and South, The Counte of Monte Cristo, To Kill a mockingbird and so on. 

However, I become less and less impressed with classics and other genres in only a few years. I didn‚Äôt enjoy Dracula, Rebecca, Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, 1984, their eyes were watching god, lord of the flies, the strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde. It‚Äôs not that I found them boring. It‚Äôs that none of them have impressed me and I feel like I‚Äôve wasted my time reading them. If I‚Äôm not impressed with the book then it wasn‚Äôt a good reading experiencing for me. I‚Äôve read variety of other genres, but none of them have impressed me either. I‚Äôve read Sharp objects by Gillian Flynn and it was laughably bad. The secret history by Donna Tart was nothing impressive as well. I was mildly impressed with the first book of the Mistborn trilogy, but the second one was a disappointment. The last books that impressed me and;therefore, I found enjoyable were Frankenstein and Gulliver‚Äôs travel. They were something new and different from what I‚Äôve read before. I‚Äôm currently reading Robinson Crusoe. It‚Äôs interesting but I‚Äôm still not impressed. 

I‚Äôve nearly lost my passion for reading and the only thing that keeps me reading is non-fiction, but I can‚Äôt read a lot of non-fiction because the books are so expensive and my library rarely carries the non-fiction books I want. I don‚Äôt really enjoy reading on my ipad or kindle. I sometimes wish I had the mind of a teenager again so I can enjoy reading again without being so extremely critical of every book I read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dubo3h/does_anyone_find_fiction_less_enjoyable_the_more/,2019-11-10T13:52:26Z,71,0,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
wmi7ty,The best books ever written; a meta-analysis of the internet's lists.,"I think most of us here have come to the realisation that there are too many books, and too little time to read them all. This raises what I consider a bigger problem: If I can only read a finite number of books in my lifetime, how do I choose what books to read?

Personally, I have always wanted to read the books considered the best and most influential to literature and greater society. However, I was having difficulty finding a list that I considered an acceptable interpretation of this question. Several internet communities, media publications and academics have published their own version of what they consider either the ‚Äòbest‚Äô or ‚Äòmost influential‚Äô books, but many of these contained so much variety and potential for individual preference that I couldn‚Äôt take just one of them as my essential source. So, I decided to analyse and combine the data from approximately 20 of these lists.

The most robust resource I could find for this project was thegreatestbooks.org, a website that combines the data of 130 different lists. However, this algorithm contains rules that result in certain lists counting more than others, such as lists voted by authors and experts counting more than user-generated lists. Personally, I would have taken the opposite approach, however it nonetheless provided an excellent resource for a starting dataset.

My process was as follows; I created a list by taking the top 500 titles from thegreatestbooks algorithm and giving them all a ‚Äúscore‚Äù of 1 (meaning that they have been mentioned in a list once). I then chose approximately 20 other lists from a variety of sources, including Reddit, 4Chan, Time Magazine, The Reader‚Äôs Digest, and so on. Whenever a title that was already in the original 500 was mentioned again, it received another ‚Äúpoint‚Äù and its score was raised by one. Furthermore, whenever a book that was not on the original 500 was listed, it was added and given a starting score of 1.

I repeated this process until I had a list of 1000 books, and then ranked these books based on how many times they were mentioned. Finally, I culled every book that only had a score of 1, meaning they had only made it onto a single list (including those listed in the original 500 and never listed again). This resulted in a final catalogue of 556 books.

A couple of things before the list. Firstly, I think it is important to note that some of the lists were not stated as the ‚Äúbest‚Äù books of all time, but rather the ‚Äúmost influential,"" and so on. I do not believe the rankings on this list to be indicative of a title being objectively ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than any other book on this list but is more likely a representation of popularity and influence that specific book has had. This is at the end of the day just another list and it shouldn‚Äôt be considered anything more than a primitive piece of data-analysis.

The following is the top scoring 302, all with at least 3 mentions. Due to Reddit's character limit, the books with two mentions are listed in the comments.

Here are the results: (RANK ‚Äì TITLE ‚Äì AUTHOR - SCORE)

1. Nineteen Eighty-Four - George Orwell - 20
2. To Kill a Mockingbird - Harper Lee - 20
3. Pride And Prejudice - Jane Austen - 20

78wnpb,Can you tell the gender of an author from reading their work?,"My wife and I listen to audiobooks while we work, because of this we have a backlog of audiobooks and just tend to put on 'the next one'. Often this leaves us knowing nothing about the author. 

Interestingly we can normally guess the gender/sex of an author after a chapter or two. Obviously we can get it wrong, but our success rate is definitely higher than random chance. When we've discussed this we both agree there seem to be 'masculine' and 'feminine' writing styles (and perhaps also themes, archetypes etc.) but can't put our finger on what that actually means.

I think two cases where we got it wrong best hint at what I'm getting at.

We're currently listening to **All The Light We Cannot See** and were both sure it was a female author, we were wrong (it's a man - Anthony Doerr). 

When we listened to **The Secret History** we were both sure it was a male author, wrong again (Donna Tart). 

So yeah, can any of you shed further light on what 'feminine' or 'masculine' writing might even mean? Have you noticed it?

tl;dr Is there such thing as masculine or feminine writing styles? Can you tell the gender of an author from reading their work?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/78wnpb/can_you_tell_the_gender_of_an_author_from_reading/,2017-10-26T16:20:22Z,34,13,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
f64mss,"In Mistborn, why was there a class distinction between the ska and nobleman?","I've only read through Hero of Ages, so major spoilers for that. If it's revealed in the second trilogy or the Secret History, please don't give me specifics. 

The noblemen were supposed to be the descendants of Rashek's friends before he ascended, but that was revealed as false. They weren't his people, the Terris. So who were the noblemen? He went so far as to change the biology of both skaa and noblemen when he held Preservation's power, then tortured the skaa for a 1000 years. 

I know he was corrupted by Ruin over centuries, so maybe his actions like the mass executions can be explained by too much of that influence. But that just feels so unsatisfying. He also began the class distinction when he held Preservation's power.

15pp9le,The Institute by Stephen King & Empire of Pain by Patrick Raden Keefe. Never had this reaction about a book before.,"I read Empire of Pain  this past winter and just finished The Institute and I had the same feeling several times while reading the books.

Empire of Pain is a history/biography of the Sackler family, of Purdue Pharma which the Sacklers founded and of oxycotin, which the Sacklers developed and sold through Purdue. Through oxy the Sacklers created the opiod crisis which has killed more than a million Americans.

The Institute is a novel about a secret installation that kidnaps children ranging from 5-6 year olds to teenagers who have shown an aptitiude for telekinesis and/or telepathy.The Institute kidnaps them to ostensibly use their powers to prevent WW III.

As I said in the title I had a reaction I've ever had about a book before.

Anger.

No, that's not correct.

Full on RAGE.

Multiple times while reading both books, more so with the book about the Sacklers, I had to stop reading, and walk away. 

Literally go outside for a walk.

With The Institute it's because at the Institute, the kids, some of them toddlers are abused and subjected to torture including a form of waterboarding meant to enhance and strengthen their psychic powers. The kids are punched, nearly drowned, kicked and slapped by their 'caretakers,' who don't see them as kids or even human beings, but objects whose power is to be put to a very specific use and if it means slapping one of these objects in its 'face' for half an hour, so be it. 

King's descriptions of the abuse aren't even that graphic, it's the utter lack of seeing the kids as humans that enraged me.

The Sacklers, on the other hand....actually sort of on the same hand, have refused to take or accept ANY culpability or responsibility for the murderous toll oxy has taken in the US and other countries, denying for years that the company had ANY clue the drug was EXTREMELY addictive, even denying it in press release after press release.

But the internal memos show they had known for YEARS this position was a lie.

Urgh, I feel myself getting really mad just typing this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15pp9le/the_institute_by_stephen_king_empire_of_pain_by/,2023-08-13T04:27:56Z,16,33,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
px5qhw,"Got my hands on a Grosset & Dunlap Oliver Twist, thinking I scored a vintage edition, and instead find myself wading into the history of book piracy","Recently, I bought a secondhand Oliver Twist published by Grosset & Dunlap because I liked the hardcover design. I thought I scored a beautiful special edition when I saw the written name of the presumed first owner with the date 1928. Then turning the pages, I saw the frontispiece with a photograph from The Liebler Company cast, performing Oliver Twist in 1912. All throughout the book are charming black and white photographs of the cast from the play. This particular edition, as the publisher explained in the following page, was published because the play was so successful and because of Charles Dicken's 100th birth anniversary.

Curiosity piqued, I tried to find the copyright page but found none. Thinking it was ripped off, I tried searching online and ended up reading the history of Grosset & Dunlap. Turns out, they used to re-bind books, turning paperbacks into hardcovers. They also pirated and reprinted books, causing confusion when people thought they bought first edition book but was actually reprinted or mistaking a first edition book for a reprint. D&G did print original books, with Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew as the most notable.

While reading this, I assumed that my copy of Oliver Twist is a re-bind and tried looking for the original imprint/publisher. But apparently, Grosset & Dunlap was also historically known for their photoplay editions, like a movie-tie in but with stills from the play or film. Very sought after by collectors. So my copy of Oliver Twist may not be pirated or a re-bind, at least.

Grosset & Dunlap's history was a fascinating read. It also brought me new knowledge about books in general. Lately, my run-ins with pirated books are usually illegal e-books, or cheaply printed copies when trying to buy online. I've never had an ounce of thought about \[the history of\] book piracy beyond blurred PDFs passed around thru emails, download links found in NSFW Tumblr posts, and  the badly-kept secret book groups on the internet lol

Anyways, Grosset & Dunlap are now under Penguin Group.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/px5qhw/got_my_hands_on_a_grosset_dunlap_oliver_twist/,2021-09-28T12:52:39Z,12,102,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery

11sy2kj,"The Hunger Games REALLY is a rip-off of a Battle Royale, and a bad one at that.","SPOILERS AHEAD!

I've read both, more than once.

People usually dismiss the ""bad rip-off"" theory by saying that the concept of kids killing each other or participating in a death match until only one was left standing is not an original one and was dealt with in novels like Lord of the Flies or The Long Walk and could be traced back to the Minotaur myth. So basically if THG is a ripoff of BR then BR is a ripoff of those literary/fiction pieces.

Problem is, these people conveniently skip over the fact that the similarities between THG and BR don't just stop there. It's not just about the generic concept which indeed isn't new.

Let me recap the plot of the book:

In an alternate history timeline, a dystopian fascist-like government sets out a periodical ""event"" where a group of teenagers (randomly drawn out of a lottery) is kidnapped and brought to a secret location where they are forced to battle against each other until only one is left alive. The reason for this is to instill fear and distrust in the populace and prevent rebellion against the tyrannical government who has been in power for 75 years. The kids are supplied with a random sets of weapon, their position is monitored by the organizers at all times and they are also incentivised to move and bump into each other through various tricks such as making certain areas of the playing fields inaccessible or extremely dangerous. Bets are also placed by external 

The protagonists are a boy and a girl, and one of them acts as the main POV throughout the novel. They are helped out by a previous survivor who has developed intense anger against the government. The secondary protagonist has been secretly in love with the primary protagonist for quite some time, while the primary protagonist is unsure of their feelings towards the secondary protagonist and actually has a bit of a crush on someone else but ultimately develops a sort-of-crush towards the secondary protagonist that never quite fully develops into open love. At one point, the secondary protagonist gets seriously hurt in the leg, which is the basis for a subplot involving the need to find antibiotics quickly. Also the primary protagonist meets another character who helps them in the game and together they devise a method of communicating through fires and bird calls (although this secondary character gets killed soon after). The main antagonists are also a boy and a girl; the girl is described as a bit of a bitch and a slut, while the boy is a sort of invincible war machine that will die last in the game after a long bloody battle. In the end, the protagonists will both survive in a history-first by tricking the rules of the game - however, in doing so they will deeply upset the government and will end up getting tracked down and classified as dangerous rebels.

Now, if I asked you which specific book I'm talking about, would you be able to answer? If not, I hope you'll get my point.

If you still don't, then imagine this - someone like Tarantino or HBO wants to make a high-budget American remake of Battle Royale. Do you seriously believe no one would claim that it is ""just a lazy ripoff of Hunger Games""? Well...duh.

There's even the bit in the BR movie where the whole game is televised and treated as an actual TV show that is broadcast once a year as a punishment against rebellious teens. It's honestly impossible that Suzanne Collins wasn't aware of it when she started writing the book - at the very least, she googled something like ""kids killing kids in a dystopian fantasy"", and BR must have come out at some point. And it wouldn't even have been so bad if she actually owned it, as Takami himself did by acknowledging his inspirations (e.g., Shiroiwa is a literal translation of ""Castle Rock"" which is the fictional mountain where Lord of the Flies takes place). Instead, she tried to stick with this lazy story of how she got inspired by videogames and the Iraq War and how THG was ""more about rebellion than survival"", even though BR deals with rebellion quite a lot and actually in a much more realistic, mature way.

In short: anyone who really believes that Suzanne Collins didn't rip off BR didn't really read the book, or is in denial.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11sy2kj/the_hunger_games_really_is_a_ripoff_of_a_battle/,2023-03-16T15:58:55Z,19,4,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
46ul0l,I just finished the Goldfinch and I didn't like it. Why?,"I was super excited to read The Goldfinch after all I'd heard about it and especially after having read the Secret History. My closest reading match (close friend) also adores it but despite everything, I just couldn't get into it. I liked bits of it and after having dragged my feet through it for 3 weeks, I sat and finished it this morning. 
And I didn't like it. I wouldn't recommend  it but I don't get why. She's an amazing writer and its a great book (according to all reports). Anyone out there who feels the same?

8ybjuj,Cixin Liu's 'Death's End' - the most ambitious book of the trilogy,"I really liked The Three Body Problem for its elaboration on recent Chinese history and sociology, I loved The Dark Forest for its take on secret organizations and its predictions about human development under cosmic threat, but 'Death's End' was something different. On a completely different level in scope and ambition. This book spans millions of years, I have never read anything like it. Also I wonder if the physics Cixin Liu describes, like the fourth or even more dimensions and curvature propulsion, are somewhat realistic.

In CAPE, prisoners travel as Links in Chain-Gangs, competing in death-matches for packed arenas with righteous protestors at the gates.

Only this year, Harriet and Wyn are lying through their teeth while trying not to notice how desperately they still want each other. Because the cottage is for sale and this is the last week they‚Äôll all have together in this place. They can‚Äôt stand to break their friends‚Äô hearts, and so they‚Äôll play their parts. Harriet will be the driven surgical resident who never starts a fight, and Wyn will be the laid-back charmer who never lets the cracks show. It‚Äôs a flawless plan (if you look at it from a great distance and through a pair of sunscreen-smeared sunglasses). After years of being in love, how hard can it be to fake it for one week‚Ä¶ in front of those who know you best?|/u/86rj
**1st Runner-Up**|Romantic Comedy|Curtis Sittenfeld|Sally Milz is a sketch writer for ""The Night Owls,"" the late-night live comedy show that airs each Saturday. With a couple of heartbreaks under her belt, she‚Äôs long abandoned the search for love, settling instead for the occasional hook-up, career success, and a close relationship with her stepfather to round out a satisfying life. But when Sally‚Äôs friend and fellow writer Danny Horst begins dating Annabel, a glamorous actor who guest-hosted the show, he joins the not-so-exclusive group of talented but average-looking and even dorky men at the show‚Äîand in society at large‚Äîwho‚Äôve gotten romantically involved with incredibly beautiful and accomplished women. Sally channels her annoyance into a sketch called the ""Danny Horst Rule,"" poking fun at this phenomenon while underscoring how unlikely it is that the reverse would ever happen for a woman. Enter Noah Brewster, a pop music sensation with a reputation for dating models, who signed on as both host and musical guest for this week‚Äôs show. Dazzled by his charms, Sally hits it off with Noah instantly, and as they collaborate on one sketch after another, she begins to wonder whether there might actually be sparks flying. But this isn‚Äôt a romantic comedy; it‚Äôs real life. And in real life, someone like him would never date someone like her...right?|/u/jellyrollo

**Winner**|The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder|David Grann|On January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty's Ship the Wager, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain. But then . . . six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story. The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not heroes - they were mutineers. The first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen. It became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were life-and-death--for whomever the court found guilty could hang.|/u/Guilty-Pigeon
**1st Runner-Up**|Poverty, by America|Matthew Desmond|The United States, the richest country on earth, has more poverty than any other advanced democracy. Why? Why does this land of plenty allow one in every eight of its children to go without basic necessities, permit scores of its citizens to live and die on the streets, and authorize its corporations to pay poverty wages? In this landmark book, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond draws on history, research, and original reporting to show how affluent Americans knowingly and unknowingly keep poor people poor. Those of us who are financially secure exploit the poor, driving down their wages while forcing them to overpay for housing and access to cash and credit. We prioritize the subsidization of our wealth over the alleviation of poverty, designing a welfare state that gives the most to those who need the least. And we stockpile opportunity in exclusive communities, creating zones of concentrated riches alongside those of concentrated despair. Some lives are made small so that others may grow.|/u/apageinthestacks
**2nd Runner-Up**|A Fever in the Heartland: The Ku Klux Klan's Plot to Take Over America, and the Woman Who Stopped Them|Timothy Egan|The Roaring Twenties--the Jazz Age--has been characterized as a time of Gatsby frivolity. But it was also the height of the uniquely American hate group, the Ku Klux Klan. Their domain was not the old Confederacy, but the Heartland and the West. They hated Blacks, Jews, Catholics and immigrants in equal measure, and took radical steps to keep these people from the American promise. And the man who set in motion their takeover of great swaths of America was a charismatic charlatan named D.C. Stephenson. Stephenson was a magnetic presence whose life story changed with every telling. Within two years of his arrival in Indiana, he‚Äôd become the Grand Dragon of the state and the architect of the strategy that brought the group out of the shadows ‚Äì their message endorsed from the pulpits of local churches, spread at family picnics and town celebrations. Judges, prosecutors, ministers, governors and senators across the country all proudly proclaimed their membership. But at the peak of his influence, it was a seemingly powerless woman ‚Äì Madge Oberholtzer ‚Äì who would reveal his secret cruelties, and whose deathbed testimony finally brought the Klan to their knees. |/u/baddspellar

Speaking here about ""2666"" by Roberto Bolano.  

A monster of a book - the German edition has proud 1183 pages.  

A question particularly to those fellow readers,  
who have already read this book or are, currently in the very middle of it:  
Do all the tiny events and thoughts and happenings - lead somewhere, in the course of the book?  

I am only on page 137 right now,  
and there were certain passages which made me go, ""Aha! Now, a major event will happen."" - but after a while, even that event ... passed by, story-wise.  

In terms of atmosphere, the book reminds me of the melancholy of Donna Tartt's ""The Secret History"", which I dearly loved. That one also, had many small scenes and human interactions, but there was always, a bigger picture. And Tartt carried the reader through a plot which felt tighter and tighter ... somehow, I miss this here, with this book.  

Please, share your thoughts without spoiling anything about the plot itself. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9llowq/a_question_about_the_novel_2666_by_roberto_bolano/,2018-10-05T12:08:33Z,12,12,books,The Secret History,POST,Mystery
4l1ddp,Having a hard time reading The Malazan series. Please help with advising if it's worth going through the complexities. [No spoilers],"Currently I am on the second book of The Malazan series and although I enjoy the overall idea and the world that the books create I am on-and-off into the books. Specifically what bothers me is that the wording is so complex in some sentences that it seems forced to me; as if the writer wrote it this way to confuse the readers. Surprisingly people were saying that the first book is the hardest but I was able to read it, and the second book seems harder to grasp. I am at about 15% into it and I dozed off twice going into other books finishing the newest book from mistborn and the secret history, and now during the second dozing off I am finishing Slaughterhouse 5. 

**What I need help with specifically:** do the people that read these books and get through them are geniuses in the English language and do not require the dictionaries? I do not believe that the general group of people that read them are able to understand all sentence structures that the complexities form. Is it worth going through those parts that are hard to understand? Will the books ever get easier to read? I have a kindle and I side-loaded these books as I only buy the ones that I know I will enjoy, but currently I am on the fence with The Malazan. I could buy the second book for the word-wise if and only if you guys say that this book is definitely worth bush-whacking through until I get to the third book when it all starts coming into place.

8d24yi,"Holy Crap, The Devil In the White City is so good!","So I picked up this book at Costco for $10 the other week. I grabbed it after hearing about it on Last Podcast On the Left where they discussed H.H. Holmes. Also, I remember my dad had it awhile back and it looked interesting.

I can't believe how good this book is. I had to keep reminding myself that this was based on a true story and not just something that someone just made up. It was fascinating to read all about the accomplishments that were made for the World's Fair. Also, how devious and downright messed home Holmes really was. 

This book also put into perspective for me how many things that are normal to me were such a huge deal back in that time. Things like the Ferris Wheel, 40 hour work weeks etc.

1v9wai,Just finished The Devil in the White City,"This is an awesome piece of non-fiction, which I don't usually go for. Just wanted to share with r/books and see if Larson has any fans. The way he alternates between Burnham (a creator) and Holmes (a destroyer) worked really well. The only thing that started to bother me about his writing, which I noticed more and more towards the end of the book, is that he would write these really long, wonderful, beautifully descriptive paragraphs, rife with vivid imagery, sometimes with run-on sentences, that really pulled you into the story.

And then juxtapose it with a lone sentence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1v9wai/just_finished_the_devil_in_the_white_city/,2014-01-15T14:09:08Z,122,207,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
jotc58,Devil in the White City (audible),"What an incredible story on so many fronts. The amount of historic knowledge I gained about The World's Fair, Chicago, America etc. was astonishing.

And then there was an entire other story about one of the most heinous serial killers in history and the detective who crossed the Country to catch him.

Seemlessly woven from multiple POVs that paint such a vivid picture of late 19th century America (almost a tad too many povs as I got a little lost with the amount of characters I needed to keep tabs on)

8gnxwr,The Devil in the White City,"So I've started reading *The Devil in the White City* (a book about infamous serial killer H.H. Holmes) and I was initially really stoked to start it but my enthusiasm waned almost immediately as I got a few chapters in. There is so much information about the history of architecture in Chicago in the late 1800's that it just feels like a real info dump, and the supposed subject of this book has yet to even make an appearance. I was wondering if anyone else felt really disappointed with the bent of this book. Or am I just not seeing the bigger picture? Is this tact totally necessary to tell the story of H. H. Holmes?

fffdjc,Just Finished Devil in the White City,"I've read through some old threads here on the book and I've got to say, was the only person who read this and liked the World's Fair sections infinitely more than the Holmes stuff? It involved far less speculation and, as someone who's read a great deal about Holmes anyway, it plays into a number of now disproved myths (ie. the ""old"" couple who owned the pharmacy were like 35 and neither of them died, they just sold him the pharmacy) without any sort of comment. The more you learn about Holmes the more clear it is he was a conman who killed as part of his cons but not the ""devil"" the yellow press of the time turned him into and this book does nothing to dispel the mythology. 

The World's Fair, on the other hand, is a delightful little corner of American history. It comes up again and again in studies of US history, including in some of my other recent non-fiction reads (extensively in *How to Hide an Empire*, briefly in *Heartbeat of Wounded Knee*) so getting the gritty detail on it was very appreciated.

av9di6,Devil in the White City,"I just finished this book and have mixed opinions on it. Overall it felt like a chore to finish. I‚Äôm not an avid reader and considering this book didn‚Äôt make me eager to keep going, it took me several weeks on and off to get through it.  Honestly I only picked the book based off its popularity, my desire to read more, and my bro love for Leonardo DiCaprio....feel free to lower my street cred on fine arts now. 

Like I see in other reviews I surprisingly did find myself more interested in the fair than Holmes at times. But honestly for dozens and dozens of pages it felt like Larson was either trying to make his book longer like I did in my college essays, or trying to cater to history buffs interested in the most minute details possible. Interesting one paragraph stories on Edison, Tesla, Ferris (ok his was longer), even Disney felt eclipsed by what felt like entire chapters on people that make a non-history buff like me keep thinking, ‚Äúok, I don‚Äôt recall this guy‚Äôs name in history but this has got to be huge.‚Äù The problem is it seems like no significant connections come from these interchangeable people for the reader‚Äôs sake. So and so...and his wife...and his kids, will be discussed over and over again because he‚Äôs the Assistant Substitute Executive Vice Deputy Secretary Pro Tem to the Regional Manager of one of the fair‚Äôs exhibits after what‚Äôs his name dies, or because he ends up assassinating someone who also seems insignificant as far as the book goes. I just felt like a little more often than not I was rolling my eyes begging for the next interesting thing, which came pretty often with Holmes, but was much more unpredictable with the fair. 

That being said, I mentioned I had mixed opinions. It‚Äôs a very impressive piece of work and I really admire Larson for the research required to put this together. Another review put In Cold Blood In the same basket as this book. I completely disagree with that as In Cold Blood is far more suspenseful. However, Larson‚Äôs goal seems to be to present history untainted by his own interpretation or twists, something Hollywood will probably screw up. Hats off to Larson and considering the detail of this book, I can see how some of you would enjoy it. Just my opinion. I‚Äôm glad other people liked the book, I know this is the last time I ever read it.

fiqknb,My Thoughts on The Devil In The White City by Erik Larson,"\- So I did a thing. I read The Devil In The White City, and found it to be excellent, as everyone who had recommended the book to me (and there were many), had said. I really loved how so many events occurring before, or during, the Chicago's World Fair Exposition, connected to much big occurrences in early 20th century American history. And this is a conundrum for me, because I would like to discuss some of these happenings, but I feel a great strength of this book is in the reveals, and I would hate to spoil that for those who haven't read it. So, I will attempt to talk about the more general elements of the book I had opinions on.

\- I am surprised, and somewhat saddened, Daniel Burnham is not a more celebrated icon in American History. I confess, rather ashamed, this was the first instance I had read about the supreme architect. Being a salty New Yorker, I read with a smirk on all the obstacles and ridiculousness this man, his artistic partner John Root, and his team, had to endure to erect this phenomenon of manufacturing. And, by the end, I was rooting for a man who had accomplished the impossible. Unbelievable feat that he was able to erect most of the fair in the extremely short window he was given. 

\- I felt Frederick Olmstead was a tragic figure, and was frustrated alongside him at every decision. Mayor Harrison Carter seemed a fantastic man who led one of those unique lives. As did, obviously, Buffalo Bill Cody. His moment with the brave Susan B. Anthony is iconic. There are many figures of history that appear in this snapshot of 1893, and I would encourage anyone to see for themselves what happens to them.

\- Dr. H.H. Holmes. What an incredible fiend and bastard. And, yet, apparently he held extreme powers of pursuasion and possession of the men and women of Chicago, and elsewhere. One of America's most prolific serial killers, Holmes existed in that perfect age, and place, where missing persons were not investigated as fervently as today. The extreme ignorance of his neighbors, his residents, and the Chicago PD was appalling. Larson delved into the gruesome details of his deeds- it is astonishing, sickening, and I absolutely could not put the book down. Bone-chilling, and worth the read for that alone. Christ, this world has harbored some evil men. What is wrong with us?

\- The city of Chicago itself seemed a city transformed. On a side note, I began reading this book during the now suspended NBA season's last All Star game, and there pre-game tribute to Chicago kind of helped set up a flavor for the city. Cool story, right? Industrial-era Chicago was black--black buildings smeared with the stains of industry, black streets caked with macadam and tar, black air filled with smoke and smog. Black deeds made ambitious, young American women vanish. A slaughterhouse of hogs and haunts, Chicago was the dirty younger brother to preeminent New York. The fair changed all of that, as Larson's extensive work shows, and changed the way we see architecture even today. I truly caught a tangible glimpse of the city, its origins, and its culture, and see why it remains a wonder. It became ""The White City"", and was mourned as a revered martyr for arts, beauty, and leisure when it shut down in October 1893. It was looked upon as a transformative, almost spiritual event by those who attended, either common or grandstanding. It's one of those moments in time, I wish I could access through a sort of time machine or otherwise. Magic and Mayhem reigned.

&#x200B;

‚ÄúI was born with the devil in me,' Holmes wrote. 'I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing.‚Äù

&#x200B;

‚ÄúNo one could bear the idea of the White City lying empty and desolate."" A Cosmopolitan writer said, ""Better to have it vanish suddenly, in a blaze of glory, than fall into gradual disrepair and dilapidation. There is no more melancholy spectacle than a festal hall, the morning after the banquet, when the guests have departed and the lights are extinguished.‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fiqknb/my_thoughts_on_the_devil_in_the_white_city_by/,2020-03-14T22:11:40Z,2,21,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
hv8puf,Question about this quote when reading the book The Devil in the White City,"‚ÄúAnd just before the heat wave, a rising young British writer had published a scalding essay on Chicago. ¬ìHaving seen it,¬î Rudyard Kipling wrote, ¬ìI desire never to see it again. It is inhabited by savages.¬î‚Äù

To give you some context behind this quote, the narrator talks about how populous Chicago is along with its high crime and death rate. He also talks about the irony of Chicago bragging about its climate to be perfectly suited for a vacation but 17 people died to the heat wave when it struck.

ofc4eo,My wife said the words I never thought I'd hear.....,"""I think we need to get rid of some books.""

Now folks, you have to understand something.  We went to a library book sale on our first date.  I proposed to her at the same library book sale 13 months later using a copy of her favorite book made into a book safe.  This is a woman who idolized Belle not for the romantic love story, but for her library and who wants (wanted?) a rolling library ladder some day.    

But we've basically come to the conclusion that we don't feel the need any longer to have a massive collection of books.  We don't need to own all the books we want to read.  We're going to start paring down, donating to our local mission for them to sell to fund their efforts.  We're going to catalog the books as we go so we know what we have/had and we're going to keep one-ish bookshelf with special books, books that changed us, signed first editions, etc.  The rest, we're getting rid of.  The entire Harry Potter collection, gone.  6 of the 7 copies of Devil in the White City, gone.  (she has a bad problem with buying that book every time she sees it.....)  Every copy except a ""reading copy,"" the signed copy, and book safe version of A Team of Rivals is out the door.  

Now we just have to find a time to start.  I guess I didn't really have a reason for this post.  How about this; have you ever found yourself changing like this, going from collecting/hoarding/accumulating to dispersing and getting rid of?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ofc4eo/my_wife_said_the_words_i_never_thought_id_hear/,2021-07-07T04:57:14Z,699,5288,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
ltkmp,The Devil in the White City,"Okay, so my US history teacher assigned us to read this book and eventually we are going to have to do an essay on the architectural and historical part of it. My problem is that I cannot stand the switch in plot from murder to architecture and so forth. I've tried to read it twice before and have not been able to pull through to the end. So I was wondering if there was or if someone could tell me what chapters were primarily murder or history, because I would still like to read it but not switching plots so much.

(I found another book titled the same thing so for clarification, this is the book I'm talking about)

5sptv1,Devil in the White City - Erik Larson - Anyone else read this and love or hate it? I'm looking for someone to join a live discussion about it.,"Greetings,

I thought this book was awesome. Not only was it cool to learn about the history of both St. Louis and the World's Fair, but the story about the characters were written very well, suspenseful and engaging. Not only this, but Scott Brick is brilliant! I liked it so much that we're going to be discussing it live over skype for our podcast, and I'd like a few more folks to join us.

If you're a fan of this book and could skype with our group for about 30-60 minutes I'd love to chat with you and maybe you could join us. Anticipated recording date is approx March 21st (Very flexible on date and time)

I'm not saying the name of the Podcast because I'm not posting here to self promote. If you're genuinely interested I'll of course tell you all the details. :-D

11atxfl,"Have you ever read the ""wrong"" book but ended up loving it?","A couple of nights ago I started David Grann's *Killers of the Flower Moon* since a handful of people had recommended it to me over the years, or so I thought. 

What I had actually been recommended was Erik Larson's *The Devil in the White City.*

How did this happen? Well, I realized I never wrote down Devil... but I remembered a few key details like that it involved murder, was a non-fiction book and it was a getting an adaptation from Scorsese and DiCaprio. So I used google and came to the result of Killers was very obviously the book I should be throwing into my to read profile.

g71sfw,"If I love historical non-fiction, but don't care for true crime, is it worth it to read The Devil in a White City?","Hi y'all. I have a few questions for those who have read 'The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America' by Erik Larson. 

I'm on chapter 2 of my kindle sample of the book. I'm a history buff, and it's ostensibly everything that captivates me about a non-fiction work. I'm really digging how Larson's flowery and speculative language reads like a novel. The scope of the 1893 World's Fair and the name-dropping of relevant people of historical significance is fascinating, I keep excitedly checking Wikipedia every time he references a person or place that played a role in the planning and building of the fair. There's a lot of interesting stuff going on here. 

Still, I'm undecided if I should continue reading. I'm not a fan of true crime, but I understand that TDITWC has a dual plot line about a doctor's murder spree. I'm afraid that once the narrative shifts into the crimes of Dr. H.H. Holmes, the spark I caught in the beginning will fizzle out, and I'll be halfway into a book that no longer holds my interest.

I most likely would not sit through a true crime documentary or listen to a serial killer podcast, so is this book not for me, even though I love falling into history rabbit holes? How grisly are the details of the doctor's murders? Would you say that the book is more for true crime fans than history lovers? I would love to hear what other readers think.

ABOUT DEAD WAKE:
On May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era‚Äôs great transatlantic ‚ÄúGreyhounds‚Äù‚Äîthe fastest liner then in service‚Äîand her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack.

z0cfjm,The last great russian novel?,"Have you ever considered that ¬´The Master & the Margarita¬ª is the last great book of the Russian literary tradition? Dostoevsky, Gogol, Tolstoy, Chekhov - their legacy combined the unity of a good plot, a variety of meanings and the uniqueness of imagery. Bulgakov was the last one who managed to go this way, writing some truly great novels like ¬´Heart of a Dog¬ª, ¬´The Fatal Eggs¬ª, ¬´The White Guard¬ª (a.k.a. ¬´The Days of the Turbins¬ª).  


What happened after Bulgakov?

After Bulgakov, the magnificent Nabokov came, but his main novels were written in a different language and about simpler themes. Perhaps Shalamov? But it's camp prose about pressing tragedies, not about something eternal. Pasternak and Brodsky? Great examples of the Russian language, but they don't have all three elements of ""greatness"" at the same time. Sholokhov? Probably most of the people who are more familiar with Russian culture mentioned him. Well... Sholokhov's (as well as Gorky's) works are an example of craven propaganda constructions dedicated to promoting the ideas of the most anti-Russian state in history. What about today? Good modern Russian authors like Elizarov, Pelevin, Sorokin and Stepnova have gone too far even from Brodsky.

It looks like the ""Russian Faust"" about an incredible woman, a black cat and the devil is the last thing we have.

odkuli,'The Colour Out of Space' is Lovecraft at his very best,"So for a bit of context, I have been steadily working my way through the Necronomicon collection of Lovecraft's 'best weird stories', and generally enjoying them only as much as I expect to - up to a point, most of the stories run to a straightforward formula of: anonymous but wholesome WASP man finds something mysterious and horrifying and escapes with his life but not his sanity; also there's loads of extremely, stunningly racist rhetoric for some reason (The Rats in the Walls and your irrelevant little 'self-insert', I'm looking at you).

But THIS story is utterly on another level - it's exactly the kind of thing I picture when I think of 'Cosmic Horror', and everything about it is written so incredibly perfectly. In short, >!a meteorite made of a strangely coloured metal lands on a New England farm. Scientists who come to investigate it inadvertently release a nameless horror into the surrounding countryside, which proceeds to literally suck the life out of plants, animals, and, eventually, the human inhabitants of the farm.!< I could go into extensive detail about every tiny tidbit that I love about this story, but I will just say two things that really stood out to me - the first is that The Colour Out of Space is a divergence from the essentially gothic, fantastical, 'ghouls-and-demons' style of Lovecraft's other works. It comes across as genuine cosmic horror, and his choice to make the 'thing' into a nebulous, gaseous, faceless alien is far more effective in making it 'indescribable', imo, than some big scary monster with tentacles.

The second stand-out feature is that *There Is No Racism In This Short Story And It Is Vastly Improved By Its Absence* - seriously, when Lovecraft isn't trying to tell his reader that every non-white person on the face of the earth is a horrible devil-worshipping caricature, his writing is markedly superior (how shocking). Who could have guessed that simply not trying to stuff piles of worthless eugenicist bullshit into your stories about scary monsters could make your work easier to read??!

hvp7if,Anyone here read *Naked Lunch* by William Burroughs? What the hell is going on,"Hello!
Came across William Burroughs *Naked Lunch* and let me tell you it's like deciphering hieroglyphics when it comes to understanding what the hell is going on.....Let me give you an excerpt to show you what i'm talking about:




I can feel the heat closing in, feel them out there making their moves, setting up their devil doll stool pigeons, crooning over my spoon and dropper I throw away at Washington Square Station, vault a turnstile and two flights down the iron stairs, catch an uptown A train....Young, good looking, crew cut, Ivy League, advertising exec type fruit holds the door back for me. I am evidently his idea of a character. You know the type comes on with bartenders and cab drivers, talking about right hooks and the Dodgers, call the counterman in Nedick's by his first name. A real asshole. And right on time this narcotics dick in a white trench coat (imagine tailing somebody in a white trench coat - trying to pass as a fag i guess) hit the platform. I can hear the way he would say it holding my outfit in his left hand, right hand on his piece: ""I think you dropped something, fella""


But the subway is moving.


""so long flatfoot!"" I yell, giving fruit his B production. I look into fruit's eyes, take in the white teeth, the Florida tan, the $200 sharkskin suit, the button down Brooks Brothers shirt and carrying *The News* as a prop. ""Only thing i read is Little Abner.""


A square wants to come on hip....Talks about ""pod"" and smoke it now and then, and keeps some around to offer the fast Hollywood types.


""Thanks, kid"" I say, ""I can see you're one of our own."" His face lights up like a pinball machine, with stupid pink effect.







Those^ were the first few paragraphs of the book....what I understand so far is that this guy goes down the subway to take the ""A train"" and comes across this Ivy-League type dude who holds the door open for him....and then describes how he might appear to fruit guy. Then i'm lost after he says ""I hear the way he would say it holding my outfit...."" at the end of the first paragraph. Hear the way **who** would say it? Perhaps i'm not familiar with the lingo or literary style but any references or tips on how to interpret this text would be greatly appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hvp7if/anyone_here_read_naked_lunch_by_william_burroughs/,2020-07-22T07:16:23Z,28,17,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery

2avbai,Found these 5 books yesterday at Goodwill. What are some of the best books you've found there?,"I think I found some good ones yesterday (for a total of $12):

* *The Commoner* by  John Burnham Schwartz in hardback (I liked the cover and takes place in Japan--a place/culture that interests me)
* *Me Talk Pretty One Day* by David Sedaris in hardback (obviously had to snatch this one up)
* *The Devil in the White City* by Erik Larson (had previously seen this listed on ""10 Best Books You're Sure to Find in Any Airport"" and the plot intrigued me)
* *A Tree Grows in Brooklyn* by Betty Smith (kept hearing about this book on this sub and how great it is so I grabbed it right away)
* *The Wind-up Bird Chronicle* by Haruki Murakami (an author I've been hearing about lately through this sub so thought I'd give it a try! Is this a good one to start with?)

Last night I began *Reading Lolita in Tehran* by Azar Nafisi and I can already tell this will be another gem I found in Goodwill.

Lastly, another favorite of mine that I found is *Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons* by Lorna Landvik --has anyone read this?? It's such a cute story.

Tell me what good books you all have found in Goodwill!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2avbai/found_these_5_books_yesterday_at_goodwill_what/,2014-07-16T16:27:28Z,14,3,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
w0ekba,I've just finished Hour of the Witch by Chris Bohjalian and two things bothered me.,"This is excellent historical fiction. The characters feel extremely human. All kudos to the author for such a well-researched, well written story.

But I must point out two things that bothered me after I finished.

1. **Mary is an idiot** \- making out with Henry in her parents' house *while other people were present* and not throwing away the forks she kept as part of her scheme to frame the servant for her husband's murder. People (including a f(#\*ing magistrate) already suspect her of witchery. Her father was publicly admonished for bringing in what the superstitious people of Boston think are ""the devil's tines"" and still she hides them *in her house?*  Toss them into the ocean, white-meat-for-brains!
2. **Peregrine is a dumb falcon**\- We are given more than enough to understand her motivation for revenge but not her incompetence or the ludicrous length of time it took her to set it in motion. I mean, she's had ample time and at least one opportunity that didn't involve resorting to things people would see as criminal at best and witchcraft at worst. She could've done something in the *years* between her abuse/her mother's death and the events of the book. Maybe she only found her courage recently, but she *still* could have said something during the divorce hearing. In the end, what does she do? Nearly kill an innocent woman and the family she serves hold with her idiocy (*hurr I must have switched my cauldrons sorry for almost poisoning you durr),* contributes to Mary being accused of witchcraft with a buried-fork spell (which, as far as I can tell, doesn't seem to work at all), and then nearly botches the jailbreak, getting beat on by her father one last time for good measure. 

I must admit that I know very little about the setting. I am not American. I have very little knowledge of Puritans or colonial times and what people were like then so, maybe this will be clearer to someone with more knowledge (or maybe someone with better reading comprehension who didn't have to check the dictionary every other page because they knew what gimlets and gouges and andirons are).

Is there something I've missed? Or did the characters just make dumb decisions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/w0ekba/ive_just_finished_hour_of_the_witch_by_chris/,2022-07-16T11:31:07Z,5,12,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
tk4up,Really amazing historical biographies are hard to find. Tips from other areas of the world?,"Hi, bookit. I've become a huge fan recently of historical narrative biographies - Edmund Morris's [Theodore Rex](http://www.amazon.com/Theodore-Modern-Library-Paperbacks-ebook/dp/B004DEPH0M/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1336857976&sr=1-1) got me started, and I read the whole trilogy; I've read David McCullough's [Truman](http://www.amazon.com/Truman-ebook/dp/B000FC0VVQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1336858076&sr=1-1) and [John Adams](http://www.amazon.com/John-Adams-ebook/dp/B000FC0QHA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1336858027&sr=1-1), and I recently finished Candice Millard's [Destiny of the Republic](http://www.amazon.com/Destiny-Republic-Medicine-President-ebook/dp/B004J4X33O/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1336858112&sr=1-1). Erik Larson's [Devil in the White City](http://www.amazon.com/The-Devil-White-City-ebook/dp/B000FC0ZIA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1336858193&sr=1-1) and Simon Winchester's [The Professor and the Madman](http://www.amazon.com/The-Professor-Madman-P-S-ebook/dp/B000FCKM7E/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1336858363&sr=1-1) are also great examples.  I find this format is really compelling - it combines a literary flair for dramatization and historical context with rigorous research, and I think it's thrilling to know that the story you're reading *actually happened,* and influenced the world we live in today.

So now I'm really eager to find works like this centered in other parts of the world. I love history, but reading dry, scholarly historical works about this place or that can be a drag. I know of several great fictional works set in other places in the world - India, Africa, Asia and Europe - that give the reader a good historical sense too (I'm happy to share recs!), but I'd really like to find something non-fiction. Any tips?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tk4up/really_amazing_historical_biographies_are_hard_to/,2012-05-12T21:36:24Z,2,3,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
fl1i7c,"The Best HORROR Books, Novels, and Stories of the Past Decade (2010-2014)","Hey guys, I'm back with a new list in addition to my recent post covering the last 5 years:



 [The Best HORROR Books, Novels, and Stories of the Last 5 Years (2015-2019)](https://old.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/f7879h/the_best_horror_books_novels_and_stories_of_the/) 



Thus, this expands the total ""Best Of"" to the last ten years, encompassing 2010-2019 (i.e. the list below is for 2010 through 2014, and the link above is for 2015-2019).



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



It's always nice to have one place to find recommendations, and unfortunately it's often difficult to find said places, so I have created one based on what I've found to be considered \*\*AWARD-WORTHY HORROR NOVELS\*\*. 



*Essentially, these are the horror stories that were nominated for and/or won horror awards, OR were considered in that vein by readers.*


One website that might be overlooked by folks is Worlds Without End, which (fantastically!) lists ALL award-winners and nominees (going back decades) for science fiction, fantasy, and horror in one convenient place:



[http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books\_index.asp](http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_index.asp)



For the above site, you should be eyeing these major horror awards:



- Bram Stoker Award



- Shirley Jackson Award



- August Derleth Award (British based)


Additionally, they have a section titled ""Award Worthy Novels"" (hence where I got my idea) that has more underrated/ under-known novels as well, which is in my opinion a fantastic resource:


http://www.worldswithoutend.com/lists_awardworthybooks.asp?genre=H&awyr=2019




Of course, there is also the Goodreads award for horror, so I have taken as many horror novels from their yearly award winners as I have the patience to write down (usually the top 10 or so).


https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-horror-books-2014



I also skimmed plenty of ""Best of 201X"" lists to make sure I didn't miss anything.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



I also did a list for the best Science Fiction novels and stories of the last 5 years which you can find here:

xzcm7v,"The controversial ending to Hannibal, and other differences.","I know, it's old, prolly been done on this sub already. But I just finished the book and movie back to back, and I feel like chatting about it. People always focus on the weird controversial ending of the book, but there's a lot of interesting differences. 

‚Ä¢ Mason Verger's sister. This could easily be a whole separate movie. Not enough time for it. Mason's dad left Mason the family fortune, but not Margot... he's pissed that she turned out to be a lesbian. But the money can pass on to an heir. One confirmed by DNA... no adoptees. 

Margot can't have kids. She's a bodybuilder, and years of taking steroids have wrecked her womb. She's also a lesbian, and was repeatedly molested and abused by her brother. But she wants that inheritance, so she still tolerates him. She's trying to convince Mason to let a clinic harvest his sperm, which can be used to fertilize Margot's girlfriend, creating a Verger heir. 

Hannibal, before Mason's 'incident', had her as a patient, and he suggested it would be therapeutic for her to kill her brother. I think Mason suspects that once she has her heir, he might be dead meat.

Years later, when Mason concocts a plan to catch Hannibal, he hires Barney... the orderly who is something of an expert on Hannibal. Margot and Barney bond over who can deadlift more, striking up an unlikely friendship. There's an awkward scene where Margot casually joins him at the communal showers, trying to make small talk as she soaps up. Just a couple of bros in the locker room. But Barney misreads it, tries to kiss her, inadvertantly poking her with the tentpole, and she slaps him and runs away. 

Still, they make up, and establish ground rules about nudity. She tries to convince Barney to kill Mason, but he refuses. She's patient, though. Hannibal, after his capture, gives her a helpful idea - A taser, if applied to the balls, will make it easy to harvest Mason's sperm. 

When Lecter escapes his horrible fate at the pig farm, there is no ""why don't you push him in, Cordell?"" scene. Mason survives. And Margot seizes her opportunity. 

Right after Hannibal escapes, she bashes Cordell's head in with a hammer, leaving Mason defenseless when the taser comes out. In ten minutes, she has what she needs. Then she grabs Mason's massive carnivorous pet eel, hauls it onto his chest, cracks open Mason's jaw, and shoves the eel down his throat. It's a pretty brutal scene, arguably a worse fate than what he got in the movies. When the police arrive, she lays it all on Hannibal.

Towards the end, despite everything, she's worried about witnesses. She visits Barney, who senses he's in danger. So he gives her his most prized piece of Hannibal merchandise, the infamous mask, which has a few bits of hair and dried spit. This gives her DNA evidence that can save her, if the question of Mason's death becomes an issue. They part as friends - ""if it was gonna be anybody Barney, it would be you, but I just wasn't wired that way"".

‚Ä¢ Ardelia Mapp - this character felt like an afterthought in the book, so it's no shock she was cut from the movie. She's Starling's roommate.  A source of strength and a comfort when Starling has a bad day. She never interacts with anyone else, except to confront Barney to see if he knew where Starling disappared to. Later, after her 'liberation', Starling sends her a ring with their initials carved into it. She lets Ardelia know she's alive and well, but don't go looking for her. Ardelia walks to the Potomac river, seething, wanting to toss it into the water, but can't.

‚Ä¢ There was a botched attempt to get Lecter's print by Pazzi, he hired a Gypsy woman with a criminal record and a kid, who he knew to be an expert pickpocket. She uses her baby as a distraction to give Lecter that chance to grab her wrist, with the shiny bracelet. But she sees light reflecting red out of his eyes and is convinced she has encountered the devil, and changes course at the last second, refusing to do the job. She's afraid the devil will take her baby. Pazzi pressures her with increased jailtime, and she says she knows someone who will do it, Gnocco. He pulls it off, but as in the movie, gets killed for his trouble. Pazzi later makes good on a promise to the woman and her family, getting her a ride to Australia and an envelope of cash. She asks about Gnocco, and Pazzis insists he's coming ""later"". The woman's old mother knows this is bullshit, and spits on his shadow. Given his fate, I'd say she laid a pretty solid curse on him.

‚Ä¢ Krendler, the unrepentant asshole, has a funny moment where someone steps on his line. We get a get glimpse into his past... fumbling around in the car with a young woman who looks like Starling, who taunts him when he can't get it up. There's a hint he may be a self-loating, closeted homosexual. In any case, he's so pleased with his ""cornpone country pussy"" line that he fantasizes about zinging Starling with another... ""aren't you a little old to still be fucking your Daddy, even for southern white trash?"". When he gets her suspended, there's a moment where he's about to deliver it, but someone from the Italian consulate interrupts him and tells Starling that he believes she's innocent of helping Lecter, and he's sorry to see her mistreatment by her bosses. Then the marshall escorts her out, saying more or less the same thing, and reminding us that Starling's fans outnumber her haters.

‚Ä¢ Mischa - the one part of the book that to me, almost rings wrong. Hannibal's origins are partially revealed. We know his sister is eaten by some starving deserters, and he avenges her, but still has nightmares about her. In one scene, he sleeps on an airplane and wake up with a scream. Hannibal just doesn't seem like a guy capable of screaming, even in his deepest nightmares. But in the book he's got this weird, almost naive desperate wish to bring back his sister, his little childhood buddy, to the point where he's writing complicated mathematical proofs that he hopes will demonstrate that time reverses, entropy isn't permanent, and Mischa gets un-eaten, like a shattered teacup coming back together. It's so odd and heartfelt. It doesn't fit with his cheery, spiteful ruthlessness.

‚Ä¢ Annnnd... of course there's the ending. I guess the big question for me is, is it believable? Or just Thomas Harris fucking with us? 

Well, Hannibal is established as a master manipulator, from day one. In Silence of the Lambs, we're told he got Miggs to swallow his tongue. No chemicals needed, he just talked him into it. We all accepted that. He talks either Cordell or Margot into killing Verger, though that probably isn't tough. With chemical aid, he gets Verger to cut off his own face. He talks the Tooth Fairy into going after Will Graham. I'm leaving out the TV show, which seems more alternate-universe than canon, but in the show he easily leads the FBI around by the nose, convinces brainwashes Miriam Lass into shooting Chilton, nearly convinces Will Graham he's a killer. We also have Chilton convincing Gideon he's the Chesapeake Ripper.

If we can believe Manson turned a bunch of kids into killers, I guess we can believe Starling could be made to ditch her moral compass and, if not become a killer, stop giving a shit about someone else's murderous habits? 

Still, it feels like a hateful end to the character. If she simply loses to him... gets shot, gets beaten, gets eaten... it's not so bad. She dies a hero. 

But it's so much worse than losing. Look at how the author builds her up - she took the heat, got suspended, and run towards danger anyway. She's doing what's right. And some respect for it. One female evidence tech says ""all the girls... the women... they know about you. You're kind of... kind of special to us."" She's a nationally-famous role model for female cops.

But does her decency matter in the end? We see Hannibal easily break into her house... he watches her run, pervs on her while she sleeps, slurps her steering wheel for her scent. Drugs her, convinces her that her respect for daddy is bullshit. After a while, she's a willing captive, no drugs needed.

The worst part for me is... there's a moment where Clarice seems to come out of her haze, and she remembers something about Hannibal. She recalls the day Senator Martin talked to Hannibal briefly, hoping to get some clue to help find her kidnapped daughter (the woman taken by Buffalo Bill, remember Silence of the Lambs?). Hannibal takes the opportunity to taunt her. ""Did you breast feed her, Senator? Thirsty work, isn't it?"" ... I thought this was the author signalling The Turn to us. ""Here we go. She's about to remember what huge asshole this guy is. That one vicious little jab is going to snap her out of it"".

So she asks Hannibal if he was breastfed, and did he ever resent giving up the breast for his little sister? He says he can't recall, but he would have done it gladly. Then Starling... I still cannot even fucking believe this... whips her titty out and says ""well you won't have to give up this one"". Then drops some brandy on her nipple, causing him to lunch out of the chair for some shlorpy shlorpy.

It was SUCH a brutal U-turn, and I am not sure if the bit about Catherine Martin was intended to fool me the way it did, or just a convenient segue the author used, like ""hmm, how can I get Clarice to offer Hannibal sex, that doesn't seem out of the blue?""

So she isn't just beaten, she's turned, and her struggles ultimately meant nothing, and her few friends in the world figure she's dead. Ouch.

Still, I don't hate the ending, because I like when an author is willing to take a chance instead of going for the predictable payoff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xzcm7v/the_controversial_ending_to_hannibal_and_other/,2022-10-09T04:37:24Z,30,30,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
977ye6,I also jumped on the 54 card deck of books bandwagon and came up with my own version,"So this pretty awesome and unique idea's making some waves on this sub, and I thought I'd try and have some fun with it and make my own list of books I want to read. Credits to both u/Nacho_7258, who created the idea, as well as u/WonderfulExplorer, whose own version of it inspired mine - especially the ranking of books by hype level from Ace to deuce. 

While u/WonderfulExplorer categorized his suits by time period, I decided to diverge a bit and formulate it by genre. For me, anyway, this would help in having a diverse of a reading list as possible.

I also don't have a specific timeline - these are just books that are next on my to-read list and this is a fun way to mix them up and pick what comes next.

I assigned each suit to closely-related group of genres:

- Hearts: 19th, 20th and 21st century literature

- Diamonds: Fantasy and Science Fiction

- Clubs: Non-Fiction and Historical Fiction

For Jokers, I have a separate list of about 50 or so books that don't fall into my initial top 52 list. If a Joker comes up when I shuffle and draw, I'll use a randomizer program to pick a book from the second list for true chaos and randonmess ;)

hk3opr,The /r/books Best Books of the Decade - Results,"Hello everyone,

First off we would like to thank everyone who participated, by either nominating and/or voting, in our Best of the Decade Vote. Below you will find the top 3 voted on books in every category. I would, however, recommend you also check out the nomination threads as quite a few great books are mentioned in there.

**Best Science Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ft7kaj/best_science_fiction_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *The Three-Body Problem* by Liu Cixin - nominated by /u/Speaker4theRest

>Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion. The result is a science fiction masterpiece of enormous scope and vision.

2nd place: *The Fifth Season* by N.K. Jemisin - nominated by /u/sSlipperyPickle

>This is the way the world ends. Again.  
>  
>Three terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.  
>  
>Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.

3rd place: *The Martian* by Andy Weir - nominated by /u/Aglance

>Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.  
>  
>Now, he‚Äôs sure he‚Äôll be the first person to die there.  
>  
>After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he‚Äôs alive‚Äîand even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.Chances are, though, he won‚Äôt have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old ‚Äúhuman error‚Äù are much more likely to kill him first.But Mark isn‚Äôt ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills ‚Äî and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit ‚Äî he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?

**Best Debut of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fxcbo7/best_debut_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Homegoing* by Yaa Gyasi - nominated by /u/okiegirl22

>Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of *Homegoing* follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, *Homegoing* makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation.

2nd place: *The Song of Achilles* by Madeline Miller - nominated by /u/baddspellar

>Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the court of King Peleus and his perfect son Achilles. By all rights their paths should never cross, but Achilles takes the shamed prince as his friend, and as they grow into young men skilled in the arts of war and medicine their bond blossoms into something deeper - despite the displeasure of Achilles' mother Thetis, a cruel sea goddess. But then word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped. Torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus journeys with Achilles to Troy, little knowing that the years that follow will test everything they hold dear.  
>  
>Profoundly moving and breathtakingly original, this rendering of the epic Trojan War is a dazzling feat of the imagination, a devastating love story, and an almighty battle between gods and kings, peace and glory, immortal fame and the human heart.

3rd place: *The Martian* by Andy Weir - nominated by /u/TheItalianDream

>Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.

>Now, he‚Äôs sure he‚Äôll be the first person to die there.

**Best Literary and General Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g2186t/best_literary_and_general_fiction_of_the_decade/)

**1st place:** *Circe* by Madeline Miller - nominated by /u/honeyiamsorry

>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child‚Äînot powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power‚Äîthe power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.  
>  
>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.  
>  
>But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.

2nd place: *My Brilliant Friend* by Elena Ferrante - nominated by /u/SinoJesuitConspiracy

>My Brilliant Friend is a rich, intense and generous hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante's inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighbourhood, a city and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her two protagonists.

3rd place: *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara - nominated by /u/Scurvy_Dogwood

>When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity.  
>  
>Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride.¬†Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he‚Äôll not only be unable to overcome‚Äîbut that will define his life forever.

**Best Mystery or Thriller of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g684bn/best_mystery_or_thriller_of_the_decade_voting/)

Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick‚Äôs clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn‚Äôt doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife‚Äôs head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media‚Äîas well as Amy‚Äôs fiercely doting parents‚Äîthe town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he‚Äôs definitely bitter‚Äîbut is he really a killer?As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn‚Äôt do it, where is that beautiful wife?

3rd place: *The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle* by Stuart Turton - nominated by /u/mercutio_died

>At a gala party thrown by her parents, Evelyn Hardcastle will be killed--again. She's been murdered hundreds of times, and each day, Aiden Bishop is too late to save her. Doomed to repeat the same day over and over, Aiden's only escape is to solve Evelyn Hardcastle's murder and conquer the shadows of an enemy he struggles to even comprehend--but nothing and no one are quite what they seem.

**Best Short Story Collection of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gag0qp/best_short_story_collection_of_the_decade_voting/)

**1st place:** *Tenth of December* by George Saunders - nominated by /u/rjbman

>In the taut opening, ""Victory Lap,"" a boy witnesses the attempted abduction of the girl next door and is faced with a harrowing choice: Does he ignore what he sees, or override years of smothering advice from his parents and act? In ""Home,"" a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antique store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to kill‚Äîthe unforgettable characters that populate the pages of *Tenth of December* are vividly and lovingly infused with Saunders' signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation.

2nd place: *Exhalation: Stories* by Ted Chiang - nominated by /u/amyousness

>This much-anticipated second collection of stories is signature Ted Chiang, full of revelatory ideas and deeply sympathetic characters. In ""The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate,"" a portal through time forces a fabric seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple with past mistakes and the temptation of second chances. In the epistolary ""Exhalation,"" an alien scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications not just for his own people, but for all of reality. And in ""The Lifecycle of Software Objects,"" a woman cares for an artificial intelligence over twenty years, elevating a faddish digital pet into what might be a true living being. Also included are two brand-new stories: ""Omphalos"" and ""Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom.""  
>  
>In this fantastical and elegant collection, Ted Chiang wrestles with the oldest questions on earth‚ÄîWhat is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human?‚Äîand ones that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.

3rd place: *Homesick for Another World* by Ottessa Moshfegh - nominated by /u/ApollosCrow

>There's something eerily unsettling about Ottessa Moshfegh's stories, something almost dangerous, while also being delightful, and even laugh-out-loud funny. Her characters are all unsteady on their feet in one way or another; they all yearn for connection and betterment, though each in very different ways, but they are often tripped up by their own baser impulses and existential insecurities. *Homesick for Another World* is a master class in the varieties of self-deception across the gamut of individuals representing the human condition. But part of the unique quality of her voice, the echt Moshfeghian experience, is the way the grotesque and the outrageous are infused with tenderness and compassion. Moshfegh is our Flannery O'Connor, and *Homesick for Another World* is her *Everything That Rises Must Converge* or *A Good Man is Hard to Find*. The flesh is weak; the timber is crooked; people are cruel to each other, and stupid, and hurtful. But beauty comes from strange sources, and the dark energy surging through these stories is powerfully invigorating. We're in the hands of an author with a big mind, a big heart, blazing chops, and a political acuity that is needle-sharp. The needle hits the vein before we even feel the prick.

**Best Horror of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ger39o/best_horror_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Annihilation* by Jeff VanderMeer - nominated by /u/Bennings463

>Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In *Annihilation*, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's *Southern Reach Trilogy*, we join the twelfth expedition.  
>  
>The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers‚Äîbut it‚Äôs the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.

2nd place: *The Fisherman* by John Langan - nominated by /u/ifthisisausername

>In upstate New York, in the woods around Woodstock, Dutchman's Creek flows out of the Ashokan Reservoir. Steep-banked, fast-moving, it offers the promise of fine fishing, and of something more, a possibility too fantastic to be true. When Abe and Dan, two widowers who have found solace in each other's company and a shared passion for fishing, hear rumors of the Creek, and what might be found there, the remedy to both their losses, they dismiss it as just another fish story. Soon, though, the men find themselves drawn into a tale as deep and old as the Reservoir. It's a tale of dark pacts, of long-buried secrets, and of a mysterious figure known as Der Fisher: the Fisherman.

**Best Non-Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/h0jyb8/best_nonfiction_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman - nominated by /u/TriangleTingles

>In the highly anticipated *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities‚Äîand also the faults and biases‚Äîof fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation‚Äîeach of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.  
>  
>Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives‚Äîand how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. *Thinking, Fast and Slow* will transform the way you think about thinking.

2nd place: *Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI* by David Grann - nominated by /u/GanymedeBlu35

>In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Indian Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.  
>  
>Then, one by one, they began to be killed off. One Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, watched as her family was murdered. Her older sister was shot. Her mother was then slowly poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances.  
>  
>In this last remnant of the Wild West‚Äîwhere oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes such as Al Spencer, ‚Äúthe Phantom Terror,‚Äù roamed ‚Äì virtually anyone who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage, the newly created F.B.I. took up the case, in what became one of the organization‚Äôs first major homicide investigations. But the bureau was then notoriously corrupt and initially bungled the case. Eventually the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only Native American agents in the bureau. They infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest modern techniques of detection. Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most sinister conspiracies in American history.  
>  
>A true-life murder mystery about one of the most monstrous crimes in American history.

3rd place: *Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup* by John Carreyrou - nominated by /u/Flashy-Band

>The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of a multibillion-dollar startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end in the face of pressure and threats from the CEO and her lawyers.  
>  
>In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup ""unicorn"" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.  
>  
>For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at *The Wall Street Journal,* got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the *Journal* were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. Here is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.

83pao2,The Top 100 Crime Novels,"The list was created in 1990 by the Crime Writers‚Äô Association. I love such lists, but sometimes it's better to trust redditors than some guys from CWA. Do you agree with this list? Which of those books are really worth reading? Which of them have aged well (most of them are pretty old). Nevertheless, whatever you suggest me, I know I will read 'The Third Man' and 'Day of the Jackal' by the end of this year. 'The Collector' seems to be also interesting, so maybe it will be next. I know this post seems to look like a /r/suggestmeabook post, but because I've mentioned huge amount of books, I guess it would be nice to have big discussion here.

m9od87,Thought on And Quiet Flows the Don,"I recently finished both volumes of Mikhail Sholokhov‚Äôs masterpiece of the Don Cossacks - And Quiet Flows the Don (Tikhiy Don), and by Jove, what an experience. It immediately made itself my second favorite book of all time, surpassed only by The Brothers Karamazov. I was mesmerized by the merciless realism of the book, and when I say realism I really mean it: there were almost no dramatic moments, exaggerated situations, prose sarcasm, or idealized forms. While this would normally just make a book feel extremely mundane, (and many readers do feel that way as well) I never felt bored reading it. In fact, I think it is the most exciting book I‚Äôve read these past two years, although probably because I don‚Äôt read books for the sake of excitement. Many critics have compared Tikhiy Don to War and Peace due to its similarity to the latter due to their nature as epics chronicling the story of many families and people and making it all fit into a larger framework. However, I personally liked Tikhiy Don better, mainly because the petty bourgeois atmosphere in War Andy Peace puts me off and because I disagree with much of Tolstoy‚Äôs philosophy behind his book, but also because I‚Äôm generally more interested in the Soviet Russia than I am in imperial Russia. 

Tikhiy Don is unique in that it is one of the few pieces of literary fiction that were originally aimed at the masses rather than at an educated group, since the author himself received only a primary school education in his provincial Russian home village. It was also unique that its original target audience had just experienced the trauma of the Russian Civil War, and since the novel was dealing with the Civil War and Russia‚Äôs transition from an empire with a rigid social pyramid to a full-blown communist project, most of the readership probably saw themselves in the novel‚Äôs characters. That‚Äôs like you and all your friends reading the Hunger Games after just having survived the book‚Äôs titular ‚Äúgame‚Äù! Another difference Tikhiy Don has from War and Peace is that whereas the latter seems to concern itself more with the personal struggles of the characters, the former attempts to fit the characters into the framework of war and social change. Sholokhov vividly describes the foundations of a nation being shaken from its core as invasive ideologies turn brother against brother. The novel also differs from earlier classics (at least in Russia) in that it depicts the life of common people rather than the upper class.

There are a lot of people I know (myself included) who can be compared to the characters. I find it interesting that the protagonist, Gregory Melekhov, while he is not an absolute devil, is among the least moral of the entire cast, since he becomes numb to the fact that he is killer and just fights for himself because after coming into contact with war he loses faith that there is a standard of good at all. Other characters, whether they were communist or white, at least believed they were fighting in the cause of truth. My personal favorite was Stepan Astakhov, since he reminds me much of my father.

All in all, this is not a very well know new book in the West, although it is regarded as the epitome of Soviet literature. If any of you on the off chance happen to have read it as well, please tell me what you think, since people like you are difficult to find on the English side of the internet, and I unfortunately cannot speak Russian.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m9od87/thought_on_and_quiet_flows_the_don/,2021-03-21T04:28:11Z,9,8,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery

192m7t5,The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle - Tobias Smollett (1751),"One of my resolutions this year is to try and engage more with the art I enjoy instead of just consuming one thing and then moving onto the next, or at best looking at what other people have thought about it and then taking on whatever opinion I feel suits me best as my own. So I've decided to try and write at least a little something about every book I read. I finished The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle by Tobias Smollett a few days ago, and even though, as previous attempts have taught me, I'm terrible at writing and even worse at putting my innate thoughts and feelings about something into concrete words, I've tried to write something about which I've thought for myself and tried to explain it in my own way.
 
And so, The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle, one of several brick-sized 18th century British picaresque novels, and since the only other I've read is Tom Jones, and since that's the only other book of this kind I've read I'm going to start by trying to understand why I enjoyed Smollett's work and yet spent 600 pages reading Tom Jones in anticipation of when it was going to start getting good before finally throwing in the towel.

Both begin in almost identical fashion, familiarizing the reader with several characters and each ones situations and relations between them, before giving any focus to the titular character. Both follow an episodic picaresque structure, Peregrine Pickle more so, and yet despite that it feels like more continuous, it feels like a steady stream slowly flowing to its eventual destination, taking regular breaks and always remaining funny, whilst in Tom Jones a clear goal is set out quite early on and yet the way contains far more repetitive meandering. The story moves forward only due to misunderstandings, usually caused by simple bad timing, and therefore although the geography of the book changes, the story feels stuck in the same place for hundreds of pages, and comedically, for me at least, runs out of steam after probably the 4th time that a fight breaks out in a pub because of some amusing confusion or argument.

Smollett's use of humour is genuinely funny throughout, Peregrine's pranks are constant and yet never feel tired, and the comedy is used in some less obvious ways too. Take the Commodore Hawser Trunnion's (who alongside his two garrisoned ship-mates Jack Hatchway and Tom Pipes have instantly become three of my favourite characters in English literature) death scene around the midway point of the novel. When first introduced to the Commodore and his companions and  their unerring dedication to nautical speech and sailing metaphors its nothing more than a funny bit of characterisation, yet the fact the Commodore still speaks this way just hours from dying makes his death more impactful and poetic than anything which could have been said in an outburst of poetical profusions.

Both Jones and Peregrine are shaped by their circumstances, largely familial, but Peregrine feels much more his own man, his actions seem to come from him and him only, he knows who he is, whereas for me Tom Jones is a complete non-entity even to himself. One thing I will say though, is that maybe Peregrine knows himself so well that he see's no reason to change, he is the same person as a 6 year old playing pranks on his teachers and classmates and as a fully grown adult by the novels end despite his many experiences.

The main love interest, Emilia Gauntlet, is also a strong character in her own right. Yes maybe she wants more or less the same things that most 'goodly virgin maidens' in these types of novels do, but she remains wholly her own person, especially in her willingness to let people know what she doesn't want, and what she doesn't want she rejects outright. No better shown than when Peregrine tries to drunkenly bed his life long 'object of desire' after a masquerade ball and she decimates him in her rejection, laying the foulness of his actions and current character bare in front of him, and us.

‚ÄúSir, I scorn to upbraid you with a repetition of your former vows and protestations, nor will I recapitulate the little arts you have practised to ensnare my heart; because, though by dint of the most perfidious dissimulation you have found means to deceive my opinion, your utmost efforts have never been able to lull the vigilance of my conduct, or to engage my affection beyond the power of discarding you without a tear, whenever my honour should demand such a sacrifice. Sir, you are unworthy of my concern or regret, and the sigh that now struggles from my breast is the result of sorrow, for my own want of discernment. As for your present attempt upon my chastity, I despise your power, as I detest your intention. Though, under the mask of the most delicate respect, you have decoyed me from the immediate protection of my friends, and contrived other impious stratagems to ruin my peace and reputation, I confide too much in my own innocence, and the authority of the law, to admit one thought of fear, much less to sink under the horror of this shocking situation, into which I have been seduced. Sir, your behaviour on this occasion is, in all respects, low and contemptible. For, ruffian as you are, you durst not harbour the thought of executing your execrable scheme, while you knew my brother was near enough to prevent or revenge the insult; so that you must not only be a treacherous villain, but also a most despicable coward.‚Äù This is as close as I can imagine an 18th century novel can come to what today would a 'get the fuck away from me you freak'

After this the novels really begins to shift in tone. Whereas the first half of the book, we see Peregrine devilishness again and again and yet his exploits remain favoured by fortune, the second half in which the love of Commodore Trunnion is gone with his death and Emilia's love leaves him after her complete rejection of him, so too does fortune leave his life also. I might suggest that with this Smollett's meaning to be that despite how contemptible and full of folly and nonsense human society is, to have the love of and for others is the greatest fortune of all, with which everything else falls into place, and without it no good will come to you. Once Peregrine has alienated himself from his love, his friends and his family his affairs fall into ruin, he ends up bankrupt and in a Debtor's Prison, his rejection of love from those who offer him help brings him to the brink of suicide, yet once love re-enters his life suddenly all his affairs are put into place and he gets his happy ever after ending.

I was not a fan of the two lengthy inserted narratives, which from what I can understand are both based on the lives of real people at the time, however, and the book could have been some 120 pages shorter and better for it. I'm sure on their own they are fine stories, but I spent the bulk of time reading them impatient to get back to Peregrine's own tale.

In the end there may not be all too much to learn from Peregrine's adventures, there is however, plenty to enjoy and much to be entertained and charmed by.

‚ÄúI need not talk of Pipes, because I know you'll do for him without any recommendation; the fellow has sailed with me in many a hard gale, and I'll warrant him as stout a seaman as ever set face to the weather. But I hope you'll take care of the rest of my crew, and not disrate them after I am dead, in favour of new followers. As for that young woman, Ned Gauntlet's daughter, I'm informed as how she's an excellent wench, and has a respect for you; whereby, if you run her on board in an unlawful way, I leave my curse upon you, and trust you will never prosper in the voyage of life. But I believe you are more of an honest man, than to behave so much like a pirate. I beg, of all love, you wool take care of your constitution, and beware of running foul of harlots, who are no better than so many mermaids, that sit upon rocks in the sea, and hang out a fair face for the destruction of passengers; thof I must say, for my own part, I never met with any of those sweet singers, and yet I have gone to sea for the space of thirty years. But howsomever, steer your course clear of all such brimstone b‚Äîs. Shun going to law, as you would shun the devil; and look upon all attorneys as devouring sharks, or ravenous fish of prey. As soon as the breath is out of my body, let minute guns be fired, till I am safe under ground. I would also be buried in the red jacket I had on when I boarded and took the Renummy. Let my pistols, cutlass, and pocket-compass be laid in the coffin along with me. Let me be carried to the grave by my own men, rigged in the black caps and white shirts which my barge's crew were wont to wear; and they must keep a good look out, that none of your pilfering rascallions may come and heave me up again, for the lucre of what they can get, until the carcase is belayed by a tombstone. As for the motto, or what you call it, I leave that to you and Mr. Jolter, who are scholars; but I do desire, that it may not be engraved in the Greek or Latin lingos, and much less in the French, which I abominate, but in plain English, that, when the angel comes to pipe all hands, at the great day, he may know that I am a British man, and speak to me in my mother tongue. And now I have no more to say, but God in heaven have mercy upon my soul, and send you all fair weather, wheresoever you are bound.‚Äù

8875mi,The Autobiography of Malcolm X [Spoilers?],"This is one of my favorite non-fiction books, and maybe my favorite autobiography all time. Malcolm was such a great man. A story of omnipotence and successes is fine, but a story of valor and redemption is captivating! Inspiring even!    

&nbsp;

He came from nothing and became a gun toting burglar, who pimped out women and used drugs. This led to his arrest. Where he received a draconian sentence in comparison to his white peers. He took the time to teach himself to read, he found religion, and walked out an educated man who had quit school after 8th grade. He class president of a prominently white school. Even with such an accomplishment [for the time] he was told he wasn't intelligent enough to be a lawyer [his dream] because it wasn't  ‚Äúa realistic goal for a n_gg_r.‚Äù He became one of the most loquacious, eloquent, progressive, educated, gallant human rights activist ever! A true martyr!

&nbsp;

He tried to speak objectively with his ‚Äúeye for an eye‚Äù approach. [only if you had taken his eye first though!] He was very adamant and rightfully indignant toward white people. Remember, we are a product of our environment ‚Äì our experience ‚Äì we only know what we see and are taught. Everyone is born ignorant and not everyone has every advantage in life you may have had. Let us remember that when we judge people.  Upon his return from Mecca he was quoted many times in regret of past statements such as his comments about JFK's death, the plane crash resulting in over 100 white deaths being ‚Äúa good thing,‚Äù and grouping **ALL** white people as the devil among other controversial retorts. He is such an amazing man to have the gall to stand up for the oppressed when it really took audacity and courage. I mean real courage. Fearless. And for him to have the humility to come back from Mecca and admit he was wrong is so inspiring. The humility is palpable as you experience his enlightenment. At one point in his life I am certain that he believed in Elijah Mohamed more than I trust the sun will come up tomorrow. They nicknamed him ‚ÄúSatan‚Äù in prison, and he went on to be one of the most devout people to walk by faith. It really is a shame the religion that made him the man he was also took his life.

&nbsp;

Sorry for the ramble, it's just such a great book. If anyone would like to talk at length ‚Äì I'm for it. 

&nbsp;

There is always time for redemption! You are not the sum of all your fuck-ups! You can do anything at any time. You don't have to be the person you were yesterday. All it takes is conviction and volition. You can start your 180 today!

&nbsp;

**Here is my question:**

&nbsp;    

The dedication page of Malcolm X Autobiography is different than what he asked for.

&nbsp;

The dedication in my book reads, ‚ÄúThis book I dedicate to my beloved wife, Betty, and to our children whose understanding and whose sacrifices made it possible for me to do my work.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Malcolm and Alex Haley agreed ""Nothing can be in this book's manuscript that I didn't say, and nothing can be left out that I want in it.""

&nbsp;

I've added a few quotes form the book that show these points. Have I missed where he said to change the dedication or can someone explain to me why there is a discrepancy?

&nbsp;

**Here Malcolm dictates the dedication:**

&nbsp;

‚ÄúBack East, Malcolm X carefully read and then signed the publication contract, and he withdrew
from his wallet a piece of paper filled with his sprawling longhand. **""This is this book's dedication,""
he said. I read: ""This book I dedicate to The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, who found me here in
America in the muck and mire of the filthiest civilization and society on this earth, and pulled me
out, cleaned me up, and stood me on my feet, and made me the man that I am today.""**

&nbsp;

**Malcolm reaffirms his position:**

&nbsp;

‚ÄúAnother letter was dictated, this one an agreement between him and me: **""Nothing can be in this
book's manuscript that I didn't say, and nothing can be left out that I want in it.""**

&nbsp;

**Alex Hayley gets permission to write an epilogue in which Malcolm would not review. This doesn't affect the manuscript/dedication.**

&nbsp;

‚ÄúAnd months later, in a time of strain between us, I asked for-and he gave-his permission that at the end of the book I could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review‚Äù

&nbsp;

**After Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad become estranged he changes where the profits of the book will go, but never says to change the dedication.**

&nbsp;

""Dear Alex Haley: A quick note. Would you prepare a properly worded letter that would enable me to change the reading of the contract so that all remaining proceeds now would go to the Muslim Mosque, Inc., or in the case of my death then to go directly to my wife, Mrs. Betty X Little? The sooner this letter or contract is changed, the more easily I will rest.""

&nbsp;

Why is the dedication changed to his wife and kids? Did I miss it? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8875mi/the_autobiography_of_malcolm_x_spoilers/,2018-03-30T02:36:07Z,4,8,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery

3j5i3f,Does Twilight Borrow from the Fables Comics?,"I recently began reading the Fables comics by Bill Willingham (which I absolutely recommend to any fantasy lovers), and I've come to notice some unusual similarities between these comics and the Twilight series (by Stephenie Meyer). If you're skeptical, so am I, but I'm not seeing any of these comparisons pointed out elsewhere online, and the timing and specificity of these cases just seems too glaring for me to leave unmentioned. All of the evidence I mention below is from issues released a couple years before Twilight was first published - seemingly perfect timing for the ideas therein to inspire Meyer as she went on to create Twilight. *Disclaimer - I have watched all of the Twilight movies, but not yet finished all of the books, so forgive me if I confuse the two at any point.* Some very minor spoilers for both storylines will follow: 

**Evidence 1: Bigby Wolf and Snow White**

http://imgur.com/HYlFhST

Bigby is one of the main characters in Fables. He was once known as The Big Bad Wolf, but centuries later, he now lives in New York City, disguised as a human. However, he can still transform into wolf form when needed, and often does so to protect his love interest and fellow main character Snow White. Very much like Jacob of Twilight often does to protect Bella Swan. 

[Some readers](http://www.shmoop.com/twilight/isabella-bella-swan.html) have already pointed out that Bella both translates to and sounds like Belle, as in Beauty and the Beast (two characters which are also included in the early issues of Fables), but it's also hard to ignore the surname Swan here. Swans as we know are famous for their perfect ~~Snow~~ white feathers.

Bigby even describes his initial attraction to Snow White the same way that Edward from Twilight describes his powerful attraction to Bella. In Twilight, the smell of Bella's blood draws Edward in a way that no other person's does. He's also completely unable to read her mind, unlike every other human he's encountered. 

Here's the strikingly similar explanation from Bigby in Fables issue #16: http://imgur.com/JmeqKXD

**Evidence 2: Jack in the Civil War**

http://imgur.com/VRWv9hd

Jack Horner, like the rest of the characters in Fables, is immortal. In his pseudo origin story from the early comics, we're told the tale of his brief participation in the American Civil War. He fights as a Confederate soldier, even adopting an over the top phony Southern accent, but eventually abandons the war and moves on. 

Jasper Hale, one of the main vampires from Twilight, and famous for his noticeable Southern accent, also fought for the South in the American Civil War. He is also Blonde just like Jack, and possesses an overpowering manipulative charisma. Just like Jack. In this same one-off Civil War story from issue #11, Jack fools the Devil in a game of cards and tricks a beautiful dying woman into sleeping with him. 

Jasper's origin story revolves around a vampire named Maria. He comes across her as he travels in his confederate uniform, and she transforms him into an immortal like herself. They are lovers for a short time, but ultimately she cannot forget her deceased mate.

In the Fables issue, Jack, still in his confederate uniform, encounters a beautiful woman named Sally, whose entire family is deceased. He uses a magic bag to suck up the Grim Reaper as it approaches Sally, and thus she becomes immortal like him. As repayment, they make love all night and for many days after, until he moves on and the story ends. 

http://imgur.com/YNQXGOj

**Evidence 3: A Two-Part Caper**

Issues 12 and 13 of Fables tells the brief story of a human journalist who discovers the immortal community in NYC. He has been following them and compiling evidence, and at last concludes that there can be only one explanation for their apparent immortality. THEY MUST BE VAMPIRES. Seriously. Here's the screen grab:

http://imgur.com/jvVHMnX

Interestingly, the fanatic journalist even mentions Anne Rice, a fellow fantasy writer who had some [minor beef](http://www.themarysue.com/rice-versus-meyer/) with Stephenie Meyer and her famous sparkly vampires. 

Anyway, that's all I've got so far. Seems compelling to me, but I suppose it could very well be coincidental. Interested to hear what Twilight and Fables scholars have to add. 

Cheers,

Zen

TL;DR: 
Edward + Jacob = Bigby Wolf.
Bella = Snow White.
Jasper = Jack.
VAMPIRES.

eu86ce,"Riot Baby by Tochi Onyebuchi - a humbling, visceral collage of two lives and the system that exists to crush them at every turn. Utterly astounding.","*This review and others can be found on my book review blog,* [***Black Forest Basilisks***](https://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/)*. The original post's content has been reformatted here for reddit in full.*

*Thank you to Tor for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review! Riot Baby will be released on January 21st, 2020.*

Execution: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Enjoyment: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

&#x200B;

>***I am the locusts and the frogs and the rivers of blood. I‚Äôm here now.***

My reaction on finishing Riot Baby can be summed up with two simple words: Holy shit. This is a novella that I will have to reread at some point. Riot Baby is a humbling, visceral collage of two lives and the system that exists to crush them at every turn. It is a battle cry, a scream, and a sob for the black community. When people talk about #OwnVoices, this is what they mean.¬†

Everything about this novella clicked for me. It worked, beautifully, painfully. Some novellas try to compress a larger story into something that feels incomplete, leaving the reader dissatisfied and wanting more. Onyebuchi, however, sidesteps that with liberal use of time skips and a vignette format. Each scene is, to some degree, self-contained. To a reader, the end result is that it feels a bit like a living, breathing photo album. It‚Äôs a piece of ergodic literature, requiring that the reader actively participate and put together the puzzle pieces, filling in the blanks on their own. The structure is intentional and creative, allowing for a much larger story to be set into a smaller number of pages.¬†

The prose, too, helped keep things concise and tidy. Each word, each phrase, packs meaning upon meaning into it. The use of African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is particularly effective in creating the overall atmosphere and culture depicted. I‚Äôm generally very sensitive to vernacular, jargon, or slang that is shoe-horned in as a cheap way of creating a setting, and that was NOT the case here at all. It felt natural, and slotted in beautifully within the overall writing. The setting informed the way of speaking, rather than the way of speaking being used to create a setting. AAVE was used¬†*because that's how the characters speak.*

Brooklyn, New York. An underpaid single mother with two kids: Ella, and Kevin. She does everything she can to keep them together, but she only has so much to give - especially when Ella begins to grow into something that neither of them can understand. Ella‚Äôs Thing, a magic born of anger and fear, gives her control over the world around her. Her brother, Kevin, is smart, bright, on track to stay in school and have a genuine *future*‚Ä¶ but when Ella can‚Äôt control her Thing and must leave the family, this pushes everything off track for Kev. Or, perhaps, everything already *was* off track - it‚Äôs not right that these two kids know that they must hide in the interior closets when cats are gangbangin‚Äô out on their street. It‚Äôs not right at these two kids know so many people who have been killed or hurt or assaulted. That, however, is their reality - and their anger at that reality is what Onyebuchi aims to explore in this shattered, fragmented narrative.¬†

>I want to tell Mama about how things were getting better after Ella‚Äôs last attack, how I‚Äôve been studying on the side and maybe getting closer to finding out how Ella could do the things she could do and that I‚Äôm gonna keep doing that once I get to college and get my degree. I want to tell Mama that we‚Äôre healing, that we‚Äôre fixing what we can fix and that nothing‚Äôs been broken beyond repair and that the only way we can keep whatever‚Äôs eating Ella‚Äôs insides from devouring her is to stay together. But more sobs come, and I try to get my brain to move toward a solution, figure out what I can build to get her back, to get at whatever‚Äôs hurting her, but I can‚Äôt think of nothing.

Kev is the titular Riot Baby, as their mother went into labor during the 1992 riots in LA. When she was rushed to the hospital, it was a complicated birth - just like Ella‚Äôs. Onyebuchi takes every scene and explores the social context behind it, creating a much larger narrative than seems possible in such a short novella - in this case, we see the ambivalence of the doctors and the way her pain isn‚Äôt taken seriously. It doesn‚Äôt matter to them if she lives, dies, or if her child is born healthy. All that matters to them is that she inconvenience them as little as possible, and they fail to even read her chart before walking into her room. That is the treatment that every single scene in this novella gets, and each one is just as much of a gut-punch as the one before it. You are present for their pain, and their anger becomes yours as a reader.¬†

Ella understands all of that. She is growing, constantly, and lives in the minds of those around her. Where Mama was opaque and mysterious to Kev, she‚Äôs an open window to Ella. She hates that they‚Äôve moved to Harlem, and to an extent, she hates Mama for having brought them there. She has so, so much anger, and it‚Äôs overflowing - she takes it out¬† on those around her. She‚Äôs been hurt, and she doesn‚Äôt know how not to cause hurt any more herself. Her Mama tries to reassure her, telling her that God will help her‚Ä¶ but Ella can‚Äôt have faith in a God who lets her family be shot at every day, who allows school shootings and church shootings and violence at every turn.¬†

>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so bad here,‚Äù she whimpers.‚ÄúOh, baby.‚Äù A look of helplessness flits across Mama‚Äôs face. Desperation, then it passes, and Ella already knows it‚Äôs because Mama knows she can‚Äôt let Ella see her hopeless, and Ella hates that she has to know that. ‚ÄúBaby, that‚Äôs just the Devil at work. But you know there‚Äôs more out there than just the Devil.‚Äù¬†‚ÄúBut everything‚Äôs the Devil!‚Äù¬†‚ÄúThe Devil is busy here.‚Äù Mama has taken to smoothing out Ella‚Äôs outfit, running her hand down her sleeves. ‚ÄúThe gangs, the drugs, all the evil that men do to each other here. Sometimes even the police. That‚Äôs the Devil. But you just gotta pray, all right, Ella?‚Äù

Time skip. Kev is an adult now, hanging out with the cats who are gangbangin‚Äô in Harlem. He‚Äôs at the wrong place, the wrong time, and he ends up in Riker‚Äôs awaiting trial. He waits for trial, and waits for trial, and his trial is postponed, and the judge needs more time to prepare, and he stays there becoming more and more violent and more and more out of touch with the outside world for eight years. He never sees a judge. Ella visits him, both in person and using her Thing, but that just makes Ella angrier. The dystopian, science fiction elements of the book begin to slowly creepy in, as the reader begins to get an inkling of the way the police state works in this alternate future.¬†

>This is the other side of what solitary did to him. The agitation, the running straight into painful memories rather than barricading himself against them. Whatever destructive impulses propelled Kev that night of the attempted armed robbery now augmented by what twenty-three hours in a cell alone for six months will do to a man. Kev looks as though he is staring at the sun, intent on blindness. Ella manages to make it onto the Rikers bus heading back into Queens before crying.

Ella begins to view her Thing less as a gift, less as a curse, and more as a responsibility. She will not, cannot, stand by as these injustices continue to take place around her. And as she flits across the world, it occurs to that maybe she‚Äôs the one the world has been waiting for. Maybe it‚Äôs up to her to *fix things*. Her Mama is dying, and the world is dying, and everything is wrong - but perhaps she is the one who is right.¬†

>Six shots into the back of a man fleeing arrest on a child support warrant, or two shots ringing out and cops standing over the prone bleeding body of a young man in the midst of protests commemorating the anniversary of another boy killed by a cop. After each one, Ella had Traveled. Straight to the site of the killing, and she‚Äôd touched the ground, breathed in the air, and sucked that history deep into her body. Inhaled the violence of the previous hours. Sometimes it felt pornographic. To go to that cul de sac in McKinley, Texas, where black kids younger than her sat on the ground, handcuffed, while their white neighbors jeered and one cop grabbed a girl in a bathing suit by the arm and hurled her to the ground, then dug his knee into her back while she wailed for her mother. She‚Äôd returned from every trip with her head in her hands. What if I‚Äôm the answer? she had asked herself. What if I‚Äôm the one we‚Äôve been praying for?

And, maybe, she is.¬†",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/eu86ce/riot_baby_by_tochi_onyebuchi_a_humbling_visceral/,2020-01-26T15:39:50Z,1,9,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
fdnxet,"The Best HORROR Books, Novels, and Stories of the Last 5 Years (2015-2019)","Hey book readers! It's always nice to have one place to find recommendations, and unfortunately it's often difficult to find said places, so I have created one based on what I've found to be considered **AWARD-WORTHY HORROR NOVELS**. 

*Essentially, these are the horror stories that were nominated for and/or won horror awards, OR were considered in that vein by readers.*

One website that might be overlooked by folks is Worlds Without End, which (fantastically!) lists ALL award-winners and nominees (going back decades) for science fiction, fantasy, and horror in one convenient place:

http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_index.asp

For the above site, you should be eyeing these major horror awards:

- Bram Stoker Award

- Shirley Jackson Award

- August Derleth Award (British based)

- Aurealis Horror Award (Australian based)


Additionally, they have a section titled ""Award Worthy Novels"" (hence where I got my idea) that has more underrated/ under-known novels as well, which is in my opinion a fantastic resource:

http://www.worldswithoutend.com/lists_awardworthybooks.asp?genre=H&awyr=2019

Furthermore, what has long been a mostly SciFi awards, the Locus Awards have (again) started awarding the Locus Award for Best Horror Novel as of 2017:

https://www.sfadb.com/Locus_Awards_2019

World Horror Grandmaster Brian Keene and Wrath James White also starting the Splatterpunk Awards to honor superior achievement in the sub-genres of Splatterpunk/ Extreme Horror fiction, beginning in 2018:

http://file770.com/tag/splatterpunk-awards/

Of course, there is also the Goodreads award for horror, so I have taken as many horror novels from their yearly award winners as I have the patience to write down (usually the top 10 or so).

https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-horror-books-2019

I also skimmed plenty of ""Best of 201X"" lists to make sure I didn't miss anything, such as:

I also did a list for the best Science Fiction novels and stories of the last 5 years which you can find here:

Hope you all find some new reads!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdnxet/the_best_horror_books_novels_and_stories_of_the/,2020-03-05T01:58:25Z,26,76,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
1047n0h,In Praise Of All Quiet On The Western Front," Hello! I have been posting book reviews for a minute over at [r/books](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/) . Recently, as in a week before Christmas, I returned from a military deployment in Africa, where I had enough free moments to power through a couple books. Now, that I am settling back and re-adjusting, I wanted to center a discussion around one specific title: All Quiet On The Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque.

\- I have had a deep love for the mysterious stages of existence since I was a boy, and an imagination that often prompted me to picture myself among life in different worlds, universes, and eventually different eras in history. History grew to become an obsession for me in recent years with life allowing for me to join a graduate program in the discipline. As a man in my early 20's, over a decade ago, the idea of having my own place, even if but a small one in history, played a large role in me joining the service. The harrowing stories of the men and women who fought, the conflicts that arose, the drama between the different governments, the advancements in technology, the attitudes of different societies and cultures at war thrilled me. I saw it all as an incredible, extreme phase of human experience, and one, thankfully, we do not have to endure in these peaceful days. Remarque's All Quiet On The Western Front reinforced this notion, and enhanced my awe of those who were thrown in the meat grinder of World War I as I myself progressed through my own lonely nights in Africa.

""***Earth with thy folds, and hollows, and holes, into which a man may fling himself and crouch down. In the spasm of terror, under the hailing of annihilation, in the bellowing death of the explosions, O Earth, thou grantest us the great resisting surge of new- won life. Our being, almost utterly carried away by the fury of the storm, streams back through our hands from thee, and we, thy redeemed ones, bury ourselves in thee, and through the long minutes in a mute agony of hope bite into thee with our lips!""***

\- In doing these reviews, I try to make these writings a celebration of the author and their art. So, I will include a few passages that hit me just in their mastery. All Quiet is just littered with extremely quotable excerpts, and I couldn't possibly include them all. Here our protagonist, Paul Baumer, fighting for the German army of the Central Powers on the western front bordering France in World War I, conveys to us his extreme gratitude that the terrain is merciful enough to grant him divots, holes, ditches and trenches to fling himself into as the demonic artilleries rain down from overhead. The message here is that the extreme brutality of life on the battlefield creates a certain appreciativeness for the very smallest protections, benefits, pleasures. Remarque is magnificent in his sculpting of the personalities of his World War I cast, and continually gives us a sobering sense of the hell these characters are enduring.

***""He is right. We are not youth any longer. We don‚Äôt want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing. We fly from ourselves. From our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces. The first bomb, the first explosion, burst in our hearts. We are cut off from activity, from striving, from progress. We believe in such things no longer, we believe in the war.""***

***""We have become wild beasts. We do not fight, we defend ourselves against annihilation. It is not against men that we fling our bombs, what do we know of men in this moment when Death is hunting us down‚Äî now, for the first time in three days we can see his face, now for the first time in three days we can oppose him; we feel a mad anger. No longer do we lie helpless, waiting on the scaffold, we can destroy and kill, to save ourselves, to save ourselves and to be revenged.""***

\-I mean, both of these passages just exemplify that the very existence and life we live in today has no relation to those who fought in wars like the Great War. How could it? We see these young kids about to don uniforms and sport guns as the last vestiges of something we can grasp and relate to ourselves. We have been able to enjoy the freedoms of youth while these boys never could. I love how Remarque displays the metamorphosis of these kids forced into becoming warriors, and what they had to experience to survive another day. I had these thoughts working the lonely night shifts out in my tents in the middle of the desert, and even I can reflect and look within myself to see I was afforded everything growing up that these poor souls were not. For all the complaints, the loneliness, the hardships of being away from family, always on the lookout for something hostile and malevolent, it compares so exponentially little to the days of 1917. I have returned and become myself once more. These boys, whether they physically survived or died, had all had their promise, potential, personalities, freedoms- everything which made them who they were before the war- perish on the battlefield. It is absolutley haunting.

***The silence spreads. I talk and must talk. So I speak to him and to say to him: ‚ÄúComrade, I did not want to kill you. If you jumped in here again, I would not do it, if you would be sensible too. But you were only an idea to me before, an abstraction that lived in my mind and called forth its appropriate response. It was that abstraction I stabbed. But now, for the first time, I see you are a man like me. I thought of your hand- grenades, of your bayonet, of your rifle; now I see your wife and your face and our fellowship. Forgive me, comrade. We always see it too late. Why do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as anxious as ours, and that we have the same fear of death, and the same dying and the same agony‚Äî Forgive me, comrade; how could you be my enemy? If we threw away these rifles and this uniform you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert. Take twenty years of my life, comrade, and stand up‚Äî take more, for I do not know what I can even attempt to do with it now.‚Äù***

\- Reading this actually choked me up, and worked me over. As a student of history, and a serviceman, more and more I realize all fighters from all countries are more or less the same at heart. It's so easy as a youngster to see the world as good vs evil, black and white. But, the older you grow, the more you ship out, the more cultures you are exposed to and interact with, you realize we all endure the same struggle. One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Not to sound unpatriotic, or anti-American, I just have come to sympathize with all who are in the field, or on the flightlines, ship decks, caves, mountains, jungles, hollows and so forth. We are all here to do the bidding of the throne, and in the end you hope to God their vision is the right one. Reading how Paul goes through a wave of emotion and thought upon killing a Frenchman who hopped inadvertently into his foxhole is so powerful. Life is so precious, regardless of who someone is and where they are from.

***""Life is simply one continual watch against the menace of death;‚Äî it has transformed us into unthinking animals in order to give us the weapon of instinct‚Äî it has reinforced us with dullness, so that we do not go to pieces before the horror, which would overwhelm us if we had clear, conscious thought‚Äî it has awakened in us the sense of comradeship, so that we escape the abyss of solitude‚Äî it has lent us the indifference of wild creatures, so that in spite of all, we perceive the positive in every moment, and store it up as a reserve against the onslaught of nothingness.""***

***""Shells, gas clouds, and flotillas of tanks‚Äî shattering, corroding, death. Dysentery, influenza, typhus‚Äî scalding, choking, death. Trenches, hospitals, the common grave‚Äî there are no other possibilities.""***

Life is the way it is for us, because of the manner in which life existed for them.

***""And men will not understand us‚Äî for the generation that grew up before us, though it has passed these years with us already had a home and a calling; now it will return to its old occupations, and the war will be forgotten‚Äî and the generation that has grown up after us will be strange to us and push us aside. We will be superfluous even to ourselves, we will grow older, a few will adapt themselves, some others will merely submit, and most will be bewildered;‚Äî the years will pass by and in the end we shall fall into ruin.""***

The bittersweetness of the return home. I watch my petite Asian wife stir a stew on the stove as I write this, the memory of her being alone and my being away nearly forgotten. Maybe that's what eats at some of the most- that our sacrifices are so easily and understandably misunderstood. And how could anyone not in the same place, in the same boots understand? And, why do we not sympathize for those who had to endure without us, in our absence? I myself feel I have no ground for such criticisms after reading Remarque. Every smile, every moment my wife's soft brown eyes light up upon seeing me around once more, is something the victims of these devastating wars can never experience. Yet, we can try to understand through the help of masterful writers like Erich Maria Remarque. I encourage you to try.

I leave you with this:

""***I stand up. I am very quiet. Let the months and years come, they can take nothing from me, they can take nothing more. I am so alone, and so without hope that I can confront them without fear. The life that has borne me through these years is still in my hands and my eyes. Whether I have subdued it, I know not. But so long as it is there it will seek its own way out, heedless of the will that is within me.""***",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1047n0h/in_praise_of_all_quiet_on_the_western_front/,2023-01-05T19:26:32Z,13,44,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
qzth4,The tears of Mr.Heathcliff,"Heathcliff gazed out of the window longingly, silently, as trickles of rain cascaded down the sheen surface of the glass. His hot breath steamed against the pane, forming a small cloud which evaporated before it had time to form completely. The moors were a sullen grey, a sickly green colour, reminiscent of year old mould or dead grass found beneath an ancient boulder. The trees were withered, leaves clinging on to the dead, spindly branches that snapped and cracked in the wind like the whips of the four horsemen.
 
   As I stared from the stairwell, through the crack of the door at him, I felt a strange sense of sympathetic remorse for the fellow. His black hair and dark eyes portrayed the image of a devil dressed in human atire, residing at the Heights to scorn humanity and spite the rest of his days with a venomous tongue not too dissimilar to that of an adder. Yet, as I watched, for what seemed like days, I saw a change of expression. His cold lips quivered, turned blue from the icy cold that eminated from the window he had left open within his chamber. His eyes were still, globes of morose feeling surrounded by an everlasting bone-white darkness, haunted by memories of his former love, his former life, his shattered conscience.
 
   A teardrop fell, traced the line of his eye socket to traverse the bridge of his nose and hang from the tip, dangling precariously above the immense drop below. A solitary sign of emotion in an otherwise grim silhouette of a man. Was he human? Could a human being be capable of such extremes as Nelly had described to me with her tellings of the past? Or were they mere ghost stories? The tear slide from his nose to the surface of the window as he leant slightly forward, pressing his forehead against the pane. It joined the trickling raindrops, falling down in a stream of liquid sadness, tracing the paths of its' natural brothers but never quite matching. How strange, that a single tear could seem so human; that it could seem as if it were attempting a daring escape from the confines of these hallowed halls, to join its' brethren outside in the storm of nature's beautiful fury.
 
   If it were memories of Catherine that haunted Heathcliff everlastingly, then he performed admirably in his concealing of these feelings. For if not for this brief encounter I would have taken Mr.Heathcliff for a devil of a man, devoid of all human attachment and bitter for his past. Though now I saw an amount of sadness in his eyes that would remain there until the morn, whereby Hareton would find his father's corpse laying in the bed. In the very same room that he shed his final tear for Catherine, for himself. Here was a man of such extremes that he was not long for this mortal world. The Heights was purgatory for Heathcliff, trapped within a world he committed no emotion to after the death of his love.
 
   His emotions now lay within her coffin, amongst the bones of Miss Catherine. They lay in the earth, upon the moors, carved into the boulders and etched upon the deathly trees. The tear that fell that final night, I felt, was his acceptance and final farewell to the world. He did not know what lay beyond, but in spite of that chose to venture for his love anyway. I feel no effective sympathy for the man; his vile nature and cruel treatment of others turned all hope I had for him to spite.
 
But for what it's worth, I feel sorry for the man turned beast. The one devoid of all human emotion and contemplation of love, happiness and satisfaction. The one who would release himself from his world of torment with the setting of the moon. The one who shed but a single tear for his lost love.
 
   The door shut with a violent crash. Mr.Heathcliff had seen me prying upon his moment but chose not to speak a single word of it to me. I took this as the indication, that ignorance was indeed blissful, if your world has turned to hell incarnate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qzth4/the_tears_of_mrheathcliff/,2012-03-16T19:47:49Z,4,1,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
qwk3cv,"Okay, so I just finished (ha) The Big Finish by Brooke Fossey and I have to give a shout-out to the final scene for some truly glorious writing. Major spoiler within.","You may want to exit this thread if heart attacks are triggering or disturbing but it's some FINE writing.

- - -

My voice carried with the storm, reaching past the faraway thrum of the coming train. It held strong even as my insides crackled. At the end of it, I drew a ragged breath as Josie uncapped the urn. 

It didn‚Äôt happen like in my dream. The weather wouldn‚Äôt let it. Josie didn‚Äôt even have to turn the urn upside down. She merely tipped it, and the gale reached in and pulled Kaiya out. She vanished upon exit. No long goodbye, no time for tears. Probably the departure she would‚Äôve preferred after spending too many years here, disappearing. 

A collective exhale followed the final speck of dust, except from me. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. My chest pained me again, sharp and telling. It turned my vision red at the corners and seared me from the inside out. I staggered, though this time no girder caught my backpedal. 

When I fell, I landed hard but didn‚Äôt feel it. The group turned to me in surprise and, next, descended like a tidal wave. My name came in a chorus without harmony. *Duffy. Duffy. Duffy.*

It occurred to me briefly that I was having a heart attack. Past the pain, the realization was an afterthought, as if I were thinking of how tall I was or when my birthday was. October twelfth. Sometimes on Columbus Day. But not always. Not this year. 

I took stock of the faces looking down at me. Anderson‚Äôs disappeared. Josie‚Äôs came close, her skin damp, her hair plastered against her neck. 

She shook me by the shoulders. ‚ÄúDuffy, don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt you dare.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm fine, I wanted to say, 'Fine'. But I couldn‚Äôt find my voice. 

‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù she pleaded. ‚ÄúStay with me, Duffy.‚Äù 

Beneath the ache that radiated the surface of me, I thought quite rationally, *But I haven‚Äôt left. See. I‚Äôm right here. I‚Äôve made good choices.* 

*The best.* 

Warm fingers took the hand that didn‚Äôt throb, and I could tell by the frailty of the hold that it was Alice. Next, her lips warmed my palm, and then she pressed it flush against her cheek and held it there. I wanted to say, 'You finally wised up and gave me my kiss', but the words wouldn‚Äôt come, so I tried instead to stroke her face. A callback from the olden times, from my times. A curled pointer across the apple of her cheek. I felt my fingers reaching, reaching, and wondered if she felt them too. 

The measured rhythm of a train sounded against the railroad ties. 

Josie sat up, revealing Nora in my frame. She had her ear to my rib cage, her skin beautiful and dark against mine. Above her, Anderson hovered, blocking the rain, holding the paddles of a defibrillator. She looked up to him with a garbled command, and he handed off something, which she shoved inside my cheek. Aspirin. The cherry pill dissolved on contact, sweet and bitter all at once. 

Those scissors appeared‚Äîthe useless ones‚Äîand cut through the buttoned portion of my shirt as if it were tracing paper. 

*I‚Äôm dying.* Again, it came as an afterthought. A matter of fact. It didn‚Äôt produce the fear I‚Äôd expected, maybe because I always knew it would happen. It happens to everyone. My dread whenever I thought of this moment had been that I‚Äôd go slow and alone, but here I was with everyone I could ever wish for and it was coming at me faster than I could even process. 

""Charging,"" he said. 

The pounding of the train echoed underneath us, rattling the metal webbing of the bridge. 

""I‚Äôm calling 9-1-1,"" she said. 

""Duffy,"" they all said. *Duffy. Duffy. Duffy.* 

""Clear."" 

They backed away, all but Carl. He stood tall at my feet, chin raised, distributing his jowl so that he appeared years younger. That handsome devil. I think I looked him in the eye. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I could and couldn‚Äôt do anymore, but I willed him to absorb my forgiveness. My apology. I‚Äôd judged him this week, because he was human and broken like me. Like all of us. We were cut from the same woven fabric, with weft and warp.

He gave me a nod. A see-you-soon. Permission. 

The concrete vibrated. 

I drew a starved breath after the shock, then drowned in what wouldn‚Äôt leave my lungs. Nora and Anderson worked in unison on my behalf, compressing, charging, breathing, clearing. I did my part too, with whatever I had left, but only for their sake. Not for mine.

""Godammit, Duffy,"" Anderson yelled.

Valencia held Carl. Alice held Josie. 

I could see them all. 

Then suddenly, the pain fell away and I see myself. It‚Äôs what you‚Äôve heard. It‚Äôs that and more. It‚Äôs colors you‚Äôve never seen before and every joyful moment of your life wrapped up into a ball that shines brighter than the sun. There is light at the end of the tunnel, like they say, but it‚Äôs not really light, it‚Äôs love. 

Past the storm clouds, there‚Äôs the moon‚ÄîI know because I can see it too‚Äîand past that, there‚Äôs the universe, and afterward, there‚Äôs forever. Imagine it going on and on and on. There‚Äôs Charles. There‚Äôs Kaiya, with Jenny and her son. There‚Äôs my ma and pa. My uncle. 

There‚Äôs Cormac. 

He‚Äôs motioning for me to hurry up. He‚Äôs not a boy anymore; he‚Äôs a man, a young man, and so am I. Even so, he‚Äôs still him; I‚Äôm still me. 

There are angels too. There is a God.

Carl turns his walker around, folds the seat down, and sits. His arms are draped over the handles, his head hung. Anderson pounds the pavement, opening the skin on every knuckle. He stops when the blood smears on his white button-down, and then he stands, takes Josie from Alice‚Äôs arms, and holds her to his chest. I love him for that. 

I love them all. 

Nora starts singing a hymn that‚Äôs joined in by a thousand voices. Josie peeks from within Anderson‚Äôs grip, looking up to the downpour, crying for the first time today. 

The train horn thunders. 

I want to hold her too. Tell her not to worry. Tell her I‚Äôm here. But, most of all, I want to tell her the one thing she needs to know, and it is this: Rest assured, there is more to come.

1bsv0r,The Black Evolution,"*The Black Evolution*
*How Evolution could serve the darker races better than Christianity/Religion*
_Original writings: Gugu James Fuyana_

Evolution‚Äôs message has been hijacked by racists, casting it as purporting to the inferiority of the darker races. This is analogous to the devil using scripture to preach his message. Religion has been used to profess the equality of the races before god but has always been a tool for those what would oppress in god‚Äôs name. More damaging is the fact that, inherent in any religion are subtle representations that our evolved unconsciously influenced mental algorithms would deduce as pronouncing racial inequality. Through the Origin of the Species penned by Charles Robert Darwin in 1859 and in many other great works since, it has become sufficiently clear that all organisms were descendants of a single common unicellular ancestor. The not so subtle fundamental about evolution is that all human beings are multicellular biological organisms, animals, mammals, primate apes to be exact. ALL. Without any regard to skin color we are all animals that struggle to survive and reproduce. Through DNA we are all provided with statistically similar build-a-human-kit. We all are phenotypic projections for our genotype, carrying the replicative information that‚Äôs passed on to our offspring from one generation to the next. I argue that racism is a tool for reproductive success used to tip the scales in sexual selection. In fact anything that human beings, along with every other species, do that manifests itself as a widespread phenomenon or more specifically a common behavior trait has to have a reproductive benefit. The end game in all organisms is survival towards reproduction. Some have always said that everything we do, we do to the glory of god. I say that everything we do, we do to the maximization of our reproductive success. Racism is not the end in itself but is a procedural and statistical tool that humans incorporate in the everyday arsenal to further the propagation of their genes.¬†

So we are all equal under Evolution. So why has the message been hijacked by racists elements for so long. Chants of monkey, baboon, chimps and banana jokes. The subtle or at times overt implication has been that only the dark skinned peoples bear a relationship with lower primates. The truth is that all humans are not only descended from primates, we are primates. The fundamental Judeo-Christian view has been that god created man in his present form replete with all the racial differences. One has to wonder why god would create different races all in his ‚Äúsame image‚Äù. This specialness of the human species has been hijacked by racists into the specialness of some races and tribes. Evolution on the other hand says all human races evolved over millions of years from one common ancestor with all the primates- chimps, gorillas, monkeys and orangutans. Evolutionary biology has shown that the genetic differences in the races is <0.1%. The differences in the races has largely been due to the different environments that human races experienced after the great migration from Africa within the last 100000 years and this separation did result in genetic pooling of different phenotypes. 

This according to Jared Diamond in his book Guns, germs and steel resulted in some communities slowly developing farming earlier spurring their development into larger organized societies. The present apparently skewed development of the different continents is a geographical legacy and not an intelligence disparity legacy. Read this book.¬†
Accepting that we are all evolved creatures and products of natural and sexual selection has the following racial implications,
1)	We all unconsciously aim to survive to at least reproductive age and beyond for good measure or more specifically to increase our resultant offspring‚Äôs reproductive success. We consciously aim to live a long happy life. What ultimately drive organisms are the unconscious aims but they usually tie up nicely with conscious motivations.¬†
2)	On reaching this stage/age we all have evolved the ability to fulfill this reproductive duty: unless of course, you have mechanical issues). Every human being and really every organism without serious developmental issues has mating intelligence. This means that you have within your mental capacity the evolved ability to achieve the ultimate goal of your life. That goal as stated above is to survive and reproduce. Butterflies, cats, dogs, bats, crocodiles, cockroaches and humans all have this innate ability to grow and seek out mates. Your only impediment is death or competition from others in your species.
3)	We are all in competition with others to fulfill this reproductive duty. Most evolutionary psychologists teach that there is a separate inter sexual competition. I believe we are all in competition.¬†
4)	Our lives as complicated and long storied (work, school, baseball, football, business meetings, political campaigns, church‚Ä¶..) as they are just the lifecycle towards reproduction.
5)	 Anything we do is towards maximizing our reproductive success. This is unconscious in origin and does sometimes emerge to consciousness. The reason it is all unconscious is because you have to appreciate that an organisms that has so much vested in reproduction would give as much unconscious credence to reproductive psychological mechanisms as to the beating of the heart and the pump of the lungs.
6)	All five points above combine to say that in racial relations we will use racism to unconsciously further our reproductive success and denigrate/cooperate with other races in a bid to eliminate competition.
7)	Women do select for high value males so as to increase the survival and reproductive success of their offspring. So males will use racism to increase their apparent value. Females will use racism to denigrate the physical attractiveness of the other races. What racism does is to eliminate the competition and monopolize the mating pool.
8)	We are descendants of individuals whose success in mating was predicated on what Robert L Trivers once argued as the unconscious deception. Human beings have to stay ahead of the competition within our species and deception was very critical. If you could deceive the next person on your true motives and movements you reaped survival and reproductive benefits. Even more effective than this would be the ability to unconsciously deceive myself. That‚Äôs why the most effective racism is unconscious and subtle. Most racism has very reasonable objective explanations to shield its true nature. Most racism is not verbally communicated but is transmitted by body language, coughs, laughs, sneezes. There is a great deal of unconscious complicity in racism which is how in most situations workplace and high school cafeterias end segregated. One has to appreciate that we evolved from organisms that could not talk to communicate but used a variety of other communication means. These other communication means have settled to the back-burner after we evolved language but are still operating mostly unconsciously. It is easy for someone to toe the line in his verbal communication appearing to be using non-prejudicial language when the rest of his evolved communication is unconsciously communicating racial undertones. The proof of this is in the pudding. Another critical point about language is that it is not what it appears to be to almost all humans alive today. Language is a complicated coded system of communication. The words that you use rarely every serve one purpose in your daily here-and-now situation. Reading Dr Haskell book, Unconscious meaning in everyday language will open you up to the mysterious world of loaded language. Language is a deceptive tool. We say more that we could ever imagine in our daily talk. What appears innocent is rarely that. A cigar is never just a cigar Mr. Freud. This is why you will notice that when there is a majority white group of people with maybe one or two black person in a group these words will always be said; chocolate, dark, night, color, black, coffee, I can‚Äôt see, snickers, stickers, lazy, shit, bullshit, crap, back, running back, basketball, welfare, south, crave, right, nine, pickers, pick, help‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I know you might say hey these are common words, everybody uses them. True. Thin is I can predict that in any groping of people in room with majority white and some black individuals, you will hear the word shit a controlled 20 minute span. Take random groups of ten people place 10 whites only in a group and another homogenous black group of ten. Then make other random groups of mixed races. Interesting stuff will happen. What may seem as ordinary language will have unconscious meanings related to hear and now racial mix. Lets say you have 7 white and three blacks. One person in the group might just suddenly tell a Snow-white and the 7 dwarf‚Äôs story or a three musketeer‚Äôs story. The stories will use specific numbers to convey this message. Usually the natural group leaders are the ones that effectively transmit this message. This is all unconscious. This is critical from the standpoint that on the surface you might have a relatively happy racial mix but subtle messages are being transmitted. That‚Äôs why its important to realize that racism is not a thought or a free will choice but a deeply ingrained unconscious psychological mechanism. Its important to relieve the burden from the prejudiced race in this regard. Most people wonder how you can pretty much get along with other racial groups on the surface but still feel the need to bond with your own race. The unconscious gulf is hard to cross. What was once an effective evolved psychological mechanism that increased our survival chances is now predominantly one that we use to maximize our reproductive success.
9)	Most racism is critical to the success of the one that practices it. It is ingrained in our youth. We have no choice. We¬†",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1bsv0r/the_black_evolution/,2013-04-06T16:26:14Z,1,0,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
15r3vk,For the past 8 years I have kept track of every book I've read.,"So 8 years ago my New Year's resolution was to read 50 books in a year.  I failed, but I continued to keep track of all the books I read year after year with the date I finished.  I don't included the books abandon halfway through, which explains some of the gaps in time.

9ax0ck,What is the best book to open a bookcase that leads into a hidden room?,We've recently bought an older stone house that lends itself nicely to creating a secret room off the internal wall of a living area (and fulfilling a childhood fantasy). The back wall extends under the staircase and the room itself will function as a small cellar. The opening will be a swinging bookcase opened via a lever mechanism attached to a single book. My husband and I are having a hard time agreeing on which book should have the honors. We don't want anything too obvious (or appealing as a text in it's own right) as we've talked about listing the place on Airbnb when we're not there.  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9ax0ck/what_is_the_best_book_to_open_a_bookcase_that/,2018-08-28T07:57:29Z,74,80,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
lx0zmq,In The Garden of Beasts by Erik Larson,"I‚Äôm sure this book has probably been discussed here before but I‚Äôm reading it now and I have to say it is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. The fact that Erik Larson committed to EVERY quotation in his book to be pulled from a primary source is astounding (EVERY LINE OF DIALOGUE is real... it blows my mind). You really get to see what American diplomat life for the Dodd‚Äôs was like as they watched Hitler‚Äôs bizarre, slow and calculated rise to power. Dodd was a Jeffersonian democrat professor in Chicago when he gets plucked up by Roosevelt as one of his last choices to go to Berlin. The book gives a rare inside glimpse to Hitler‚Äôs whole crew, includes some good old fashioned Russian espionage plots, and puts on display the pettiness of showy American officials in their regard for the humble Dodd‚Äôs. I‚Äôm about 10 pages from the end and I just don‚Äôt want to finish it because I don‚Äôt want it to be done. Has anyone else here read this book?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lx0zmq/in_the_garden_of_beasts_by_erik_larson/,2021-03-03T18:37:07Z,17,53,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
nwbymm,Devil in the Grove by Gilbert King,"I know this is obvious and clearly one of the main points of the book, but this book does a riveting job of localizing and personalizing how the Jim Crow South worked in the years after WW2. From law enforcement to media to business to local and state government working together to keep the status quo. Not to mention all-time villains in the sheriff and his deputy. 

And then there‚Äôs Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP doing painstaking work trying to push the country into the future. 

I finished this book a couple of weeks ago and still think about it a lot.

‚ÄúSouthern juries might be stacked against blacks, and the judges might be biased, but Thurgood Marshall was demonstrating in case after case that their word was not the last‚Ä¶. He was ‚Äúa lawyer that a white man would listen to‚Äù and a black man could trust. No wonder that across the South, in their darkest, most demoralizing hours, when falsely accused men sat in jails, when women and children stood before the ashy ruins of mob-torched homes, the spirits of black citizens would be lifted with two words whispered in defiance and hope: ‚ÄúThurgood‚Äôs coming.‚Äù‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nwbymm/devil_in_the_grove_by_gilbert_king/,2021-06-10T01:42:23Z,1,2,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
4ci63z,The /r/books bookclub selection for April is Dead Wake by Erik Larson! He will be doing an AMA here on April 27th.,"This month we are excited to be featuring a nonfiction book for the first time! Erik Larson's writing style is very readable so even if you don't read a lot of nonfiction I encourage you to give this a try.

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22551730-dead-wake):

>On May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era‚Äôs great transatlantic ‚ÄúGreyhounds‚Äù‚Äîthe fastest liner then in service‚Äîand her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. 

>Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger‚Äôs U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small‚Äîhubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more‚Äîall converged to produce one of the great disasters of history.

>It is a story that many of us think we know but don‚Äôt, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. 

>Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history.

1dxkfm,What will be considered classics in the 2100s from the years 2000+,"I am a writer, but I love to read, which I think is a good mix. Everyone knows what the general must-reads are from around the 1900s going back. But what are the newer stories that really offer something new and innovative, or are just a damn good read? What are the stories that our children or their children will refer to as classics that have been put out in the last 13 years or so?

g3qnn0,"Just read ""The Sea Wolf"" by Jack London","So, usually I like to read high fantasy type novels and am currently about halfway through the last book of the Stormlight archives, which is also excellent. I had the urge to read something more realistic and as I was an English major in college and, for some time now, hadn't really read anything that I thought one might read for a class, I picked this out from my book shelf and got down to it. I would also mention that my deceased father was a fan of Jack London and I inherited a number of his old books. 

I really liked the journey of Humphrey Van Weyden from bookish and uncertain of his place in the world to the physically stronger and stronger willed intellectual that could state ""if it can be done my man, it can be done by me."" Hump gains this strength by confrontation with the die hard materialist Wolf Larson and this theme of materialism vs. spiritualism runs throughout the novel. Both men were very intelligent and I really enjoyed the discussions they had about life and the way they interacted with the other men on the boat. I also liked the portrayal of Maud and her emergence marks a turning point in the novel wherein our hero, having been resigned to his fate as best friend to the devil, endeavors finally to throw off his shackles and escape. I think London does a good job of making Maud as confident and strong-willed as Hump and they make for an excellent companionship. 

London's writing style is also unique though perhaps more common in the early 1900s when it was written. I actually learned at least 4 new words which was a joy on its own. I would close by saying I also found an old scrap of paper near the end of the book which, upon reflection, I realized must have been a bookmark from my father, which made the reading and finishing all the more poignant. What are you thoughts on the portrayal of Maud? Of the theme? Of Wolf? What are some other novels you might recommend by Jack London?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g3qnn0/just_read_the_sea_wolf_by_jack_london/,2020-04-18T16:49:01Z,6,15,books,Devil in the White City,POST,Mystery
