13yecz7_1,13yecz7,"I love Macbeth, but you're totally wrong about it being one of the first stories to focus on the psyche. I mean, the word ""psyche"" is literally the name of a mythological story character.

But more specifically, the Illiad has long monologues all about the why, the psychological state of the characters, and a critique of their society.

Elektra is a play that predates Macbeth by more than a thousand years that's basically all people agonizing over the why and their psychological torment until the main character finally murders her husband.

If you haven't seen Akira Kurosawa's adaptation of Macbeth *Ran* though, it's one of the greatest movies of all time. Also Patrick Stewart's version is fantastic.",LurkerFailsLurking,2023-06-03T02:29:27Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Macbeth,1

13yecz7_8,13yecz7,"I preface this by saying I'm no longer teaching (US). However, this is *exactly* what I loved about reading this book with angsty middle schoolers. I'm a theater kid at heart, beyond just my training in literature, and so I would really try to help them lean into the performance aspects of the play. I think the most important part of this story is inhabiting the ""space"" of the story. By inhabiting the space - physical, emotional, and psychological - you gain a different kind of perspective on Macbeth himself as well as all of the other characters that exist in his story. 

&#x200B;

(Macduff's ""but I must feel it as a man"" ranks high in my favorite lines of all time.)

&#x200B;

My  background in literary analysis is mostly in discussing the way literature illustrates psychological experiences. (I mostly focused on The Inklings, but I dabbled elsewhere.) I've found that Shakespeare in general, but especially in *Macbeth*, does a phenomenal job of exploring the human psyche's downward spirals, but also its resilience. Thus, as other commenters have mentioned, I'm not sure it ""kickstarted"" the psychological genre as such, that honor *likely* goes to *Oedipus Rex* or perhaps, to some extent, even *The Epic of Gilgamesh,* but I would go so far as to say it has inspired/ kickstarted the psychological genre of the modern era. 

&#x200B;

I suppose what I mean by that is, like many modern authors in the psychological genre, Shakespeare digs into more than one point of view. While the story, obviously, centers on Macbeth, Shakespeare has several characters (Lady Macbeth, Macduff, and, to some extent, Malcolm all come to mind) that also have fully developed psyches. I think that's part of what makes it feel so real when you watch well done productions of *Macbeth* or read it. Macduff beautifully foils Macbeth in the sense that Macduff represents psychological resilience where Macbeth is crumbling under the weight of his guilt. I think what sets Macbeth a part from things like *Oedipus Rex* and other older works that focus on the human psyche is that very little is done ""off screen."" Macbeth communicates to the audience directly his struggle, his decent into madness, and his tyranny. There is little of Macbeth's downfall that is left to the imagination, and there is little of Macduff's rise to heroism that is shown off screen. In a short number of words, Shakespeare manages to communicate two completely different stories about the human mind. 

&#x200B;

This is a topic that is endlessly fascinating to me because how Shakespeare manages to communicate the psychological struggles of his characters is so profound. Macbeth is a heroic man whose poor choices end in his guilt-ridden downfall. His wife brought him down to her level and, in turn, she is brought down with him. However, Macduff raises up Malcolm and, in raising him up, raises himself through his grief. GAH! Now I want to go back and read *Macbeth* again.",psshuller,2023-06-04T05:00:14Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Macbeth,8

wqhe8q_2,wqhe8q,"To be honest the 2015 edition of Macbeth is a bit ho-hum. I remember there was a lot of mud. If you want a cool reinterpretation of Macbeth, similar to Baz Luhrmann's version of Romeo & Juliet, Geoffrey Wright did a great version in 2006 starring Sam Worthington, where everyone is gangsters in the Melbourne underworld, and the climactic battle is done with machine guns that have laser sights.

Polanski probably did the best straight movie adaptation of the material in my view (and was the one we watched in school when studying the play), but there's obviously ethical concerns with watching his movies. Orson Welles also did a version of Macbeth but I found that one a bit stagey.",Flimsy_Demand7237,2022-08-17T06:52:47Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Macbeth,2
wqhe8q_3,wqhe8q,"Mothers were not expected to survive Caesarean section in Shakespeare's time (or more importantly in Holinshed's time, that being Shakespeare's source).  The first account of a woman surviving C-section was published in 1582, backdated to 1500.  Holinshed first published in 1577, though the second edition that Shakespeare used was from 1587.  No way would C-section be seen as a kind of birth.

The backstory of Fleance being James VI/I's ancestor was important.  James was a murderous paranoid and questions about his origins dated back to his birth.  Shakespeare pretty much had to back his claim to the throne or end up dead - *Macbeth* was written in 1606, only 3 years after James came to the throne, and Marlowe had been murdered by Elizabeth's secret police in 1593, for unknown political reasons.  You didn't mess around with Renaissance royalty.  The legend would have been known to the entire audience and was as much of a hot potato as whether the 2020 US election was stolen.",Jack-Campin,2022-08-17T07:00:11Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Macbeth,3
wqhe8q_4,wqhe8q,"Other comments have already given great answers about prophecy shenanigans, but I just wanna add: J.R.R. Tolkien is on your side! Apparently, he thought the C-section loophole was not the best option for this kind of prophecy, so he wrote his own version with >!Eowyn and the Witch King!<.

Edit: ooh about the Fleance thing, I always thought it was a grim signal implying to the audience that the struggle for power would continue (cause the crown would somehow pass from Duncan's line to Banquo’s, and let’s be real, probably through bloodshed). So Macbeth might be dead, but the lust for power will corrupt more men.
This is just my interpretation though, I’m sure some Shakespeare scholars could give a better answer. :)",Independent-Dirt5677,2022-08-18T02:20:23Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Macbeth,4

Some interesting trivia you might not know:

Key parts of *The Lord of the Rings* were written because Tolkien thought Shakespeare had missed some cool opportunities in Macbeth. I'll put which parts under spoiler tags (spoilers for both Macbeth and LoTR):  


>!""Macbeth shall never vanquished be until!<

>!Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill!<

>!Shall come against him."" 
--Shakespeare used soldiers disguised as trees to fulfill this prophecy, but Tolkien wanted something more like his Ents to happen, so he wrote his own.

>!“Fear not, Macbeth. No man that’s born of woman!<

>!Shall e'er have power upon thee.”

gvixf2_4,gvixf2,"Both Roman Polanski and Orson Welles made good film adaptations - Polanski's more cinematic, Welles' more stage-like, but both are worthy. There's a more recent one at Netflix, it's nice and visually beautiful but imo too slow and restrained. The best Macbeth film, undisputed at the top, is Kurosawa's outstanding Throne Of Blood, but it is also the least faithful - it changes setting, names, characters and major plot beats. None is truly 100% faithful, though, all directors made their own versions. Polanski's probably the closest, though.",BlueUnknown,2020-06-03T01:33:22Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Macbeth,4

j2kxhe_1,j2kxhe,"You might cross post on /r/Shakespeare. 

Just some brief thoughts:

Holily comes from holy. The idea is that all ambition that Macbeth has (highly), he has in holy manner (holily). This is then expanded in the next line: because he is holy, he would not do anything out of line to get the throne (false) yet he is not anywhere in the rightful succession of kings and thus for him to be king he must “wrongly win” it.",clinging2thecross,2020-09-30T12:47:55Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Macbeth,1

38y4iu_1,38y4iu,"Well, here's the brief summary from Wikipedia. I personally haven't seen any comparisons to Macbeth recently, but you should be able to notice any similarities in this brief summary: 

[tells the story of a brave Scottish general named Macbeth who receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the throne for himself. He is then wracked with guilt and paranoia, and he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler as he is forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion. The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of arrogance, madness, and death.](#s) ",dauthie,2015-06-07T22:58:08Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Macbeth,1
38y4iu_2,38y4iu,"It is, in a way, a timeless tale. It explores themes of greed, ambition and remorse in a way that transcends the setting and era it's based in. Just look at how many adaptations exist. From the BBC version about a modern chef to Kurosawa's Throne of Blood, the same basic story can be adapted in any time period, because the themes are universal. It also does a great job of showing how an evil deed, from an otherwise noble man, can destroy him from the inside and change him. Lady Macbeth is also a very interesting character, and her transition from conspirer to lunatic makes for good story telling. It does not shy away from violence either. You can pretty much compare any story evolving around murder driven by ambition, to Macbeth. It is quite ubiquitous in human history, and it is not surprising that it is mostly inspired by actual events.  ",Darth_Goku,2015-06-07T23:39:40Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Macbeth,2
