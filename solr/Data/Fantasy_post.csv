17getme,The Inheritance Cycle (Eragon) is actually pretty good,"I recently came across mention of the series, with people saying they were terrible books. I didn't know anything about them other than that- I vaguely recall the existence of a movie and owning a board game when I was younger, and my mother had the first one on our book shelf since as long as I can remember, but other than that I went in completely blind. 

Honestly, I don't know where a lot of the criticism comes from. All four books are within the okay-good range, they are enjoyable, and I really was captivated by the story. 

Don't get me wrong, they are not *great* books. It is very obvious to me that the first book, Eragon, would never have been published and marketed if the author's parents didn't own a publishing company. He wrote the story when he was 15-18 and it really shows. It reads like a fanfiction- a very well-made fanfiction whose world is derivative of existing works rather than a plain copy, but it is still a very derivative work. 

I don't think that matters. Nobody  picking up a book about dragon riders should be under the impression they have found the next ""Fellowship of the Ring."" They are fairly well-written, have interesting world building, and are so captivating that I have done nothing for a week but binge read all four of them. Eragon as a series excels at adequacy- it is nothing special, but it isn't bad, and falls far short of being boring.

nbpfgt,Ended my ten year reading dry spell with the Eragon series,"I used to read a lot when I was younger but after school was over and work and adulting began I found myself less and less interested in reading but still loved the thrill of story telling. I satisfied that thrill with movies, tv, and video games (particularly the latter), but there was definitely something in books that I couldn't totally fulfill with those mediums. 

I chose eragon because it was a series I read quite a bit when I was younger and only got around to reading the last installment once before ever returning. It was a great choice for me, the familiar pages and plot threads made it a lot easier to stretch those reading muscles that had atrophied over the years. I've had a not so insignificant stack of recommendations and plans for other series to read that's grown over the years and I'm very glad that I went with something I had already read before to jump back into it. 

If anyone hasn't read it before, it's not bad for YA novels. It's world building and rules set in universe are pretty thought out and it seemed like Poalini took the effort to really try to understand where his world would progress to naturally given the setting and rules in place. Characters and plot is a bit derivative, but the ending itself (much of which I didn't remember upon rereading) was very satisfying, closing most if not plot lines in logical ways. 

Moving on to something I have not read before I'll be starting the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov. It seems a bit daunting but sci Fi is my bread and butter and it seems like this series stands out. I might try Dune as well in preparation for the new movie coming out, but we'll see how I feel after I finish foundation lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nbpfgt/ended_my_ten_year_reading_dry_spell_with_the/,2021-05-13T19:41:19Z,452,3217,books,Eragon,POST,Fantasy

I'm a big Fantasy fan and the Eragon books were my first real entry point. They were the first books I read of considerable length and I loved that the last book came out within a year of me finishing the third one. 

Just restarted the books and thought I'd post about how great they are. Coming back to it as an adult after really leaning in and reading Tolkien brings a whole new lens to them, especially the 'Snowfire' vs. 'Shadowfax' parity that made me laugh out loud when I read it.

nc8wfc,"Books have target audiences too! If you read a YA book for teenagers and hate it it's not because the book is bad, it's because it's not meant for you (Eragon, Divergent, Artemis Fowl, etc.)","As a book lover I've lurked this sub for awhile now and people really should check what age group the book was written for before reading them or making posts about how bad they are. Eragon, Cirque De Freak, Artimis Fowl, Divergent, Twilight, the list goes on and on. These books are meant for Young Adults and Teenagers. It's not a surprised if you read them at 27 and realize how bad they are.

They aren't bad books, they're just not books for you. It's okay to admit that and move on. Books have demographics just as much as TV and movies. An adult doesn't go to see the Wiggles and expect to have a good time (although they are surprisingly enjoyable) or critique their children's Saturday cartoons or their teenager's cringe  werewolf romance drama show for being simplistic and predicable. It's great to them because it's for them. It's crap to you because you're never expected to watch it anyway. That's okay. There's really no need to tear those things apart in a reddit post.

Obviously there will be some adults who will still love YA books, shows, and movies. If that's you, please keep recommending them to people. It's not your fault if someone neglects to notice the YA or TV14 tag and ends up hating it.

Edit: I'm not saying ""you're not the target audience"" is an end all excuse so you can never say something is bad. Some books are indesputably bad. I believe that if you hold an opinion that contradicts what is widely accepted as true, then it's probably more about your personal preference than something being inherently bad. For instance, I hate Avengers movies and think they are full of crudely written dialogue and oversized casts where no character actually matters. Obviously the world disagrees with that opinion. I'm willing to look at that and say that Avengers isn't inherently bad, but it doesn't suit my preference. Try to look at books the same way. Even though something like Twilight can be torn to shreds for the author's poor writing, it is beloved and treasured by such a large audience it's obvious there was something there that made it great but didn't suit my taste so saying it's a bad book is simply not true. Pointing out flaws and saying something is bad are two different things.


Edit 2: The comments are pretty fun you should check them out. Admittedly most of them say I'm wrong and an idiot lol. But the others are filled with people saying a book is horrible and then others saying the same book is great. The only constant is that Divergent and Eragon seem to be hated by almost everyone, it's like a 9/1 ratio. Artemis Fowl is nearly 50/50 which is cool. Take a look and find other people opinions, there are some gems in there.

ebueqv,Is it bad that I am liking Eragon?,"One of my favorite shows is BBC’s Merlin. I watch it religiously each year. It’s fun, cheesy with characters to die for. So, as I was looking for a book similar to the show; a book blogger recommended Eragon. However, after googling the book, I noticed that the book has a plagiarism stigma attached to it. Many state that Eragon is a rip-off of many other fantsy books, juvenile with bad writing. 

Its has been compared to LotR. While I loved the LotR movies, I couldn’t get past the first  chapters of the book. But, I still intend to read the books one day. On the other hand, I have just started reading Eragon, and I am enjoying it thus far.

I really want to the the LotR books, but for some reason find the first chapters tiresome. Eragon feels more accessible. So is it bad that I prefer the latter?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ebueqv/is_it_bad_that_i_am_liking_eragon/,2019-12-17T10:58:16Z,305,192,books,Eragon,POST,Fantasy
m2o6sm,What's the deal with Eragon?,"I bought this book, because I've seen plenty of people praising it. I tried to read it, but gave up after 100 pages.

I just can't understand what is good about it. It's certainly not writing, because it's really obvious that the author was a teen when writing it and didn't have much experience back then. It's certainly not the story, because from what I've read so far, it's just Hero's Journey in a fantasy setting and a pet dragon. It's certainly not characters, because the main duo are a self insert and an Obi-Wan wannabe it seems. And I'm pretty sure it's not the lore, because stories told by Brom weren't very interesting and the world itself seems pretty generic.

It seems like the author just watched Star Wars: New Hope and decided ""Aight, I'm gonna do that, but with dragons"".

Normally I'd just brush it off as YA phenomeon, but it looks like there are lots of adults loving those books. Am I missing something? Does it get better the deeper I'm in?

5mwuw2,Have the Eragon books aged badly?,"I am reading the first one after all these years of hearing people praising it.

Also, those are some of the ugliest dragons I have ever seen on the covers.

jif7x6,Eragon is not particularly good.,"When I was in middle school, I was in love the Eragon, Eldest, and Brisingr. Inheritance wouldn't come out until I was in high school, so I read those books over and over again. Once Inheritance was finally released, I... didn't read much of it. Maybe a few chapters before I moved on. High school, you know. Other stuff to do.

&#x200B;

I have Audible now, and read so many more books because of it. So I decided to listen to the Inheritance Cycle and finally finish it. Start up Eragon, and... I don't know. It's fine, I guess. That book is 16 hours and 22 minutes long. I finished it in less than 3 days. It usually takes me over a week to finish a 10 hour book. I don't know what it is, but I just COULDN'T put it down.

&#x200B;

I knew it was okay, maybe even slightly above average at best, but I could not stop listening to it. Then, for the first time, I bought more credits. I couldn't wait to start Eldest and finish the series. And Eldest was better. Not much better, but better. All the books just get better and better. I still, even now, feel that these books are an above average fantasy story, but my child-like wonder and amazement of the world of dragons has returned. Because of how these books captured me even as an adult, not only did I buy credits for the first time, but I was so engrossed in the story, I finished those four large books in a month. I didn't get another free credit in the time it took me to complete this series.

&#x200B;

After so many years, I finally finished my favorite series as a kid. Most of Inheritance was completely new to me and I enjoyed the last book quite a bit. Easily the best in the series. When I got to the ending, I teared up. I don't know if it was because I was sad to see the end of the series I loved so much as a kid, or if I actually really felt for the characters and the way Eragon's story ends. 

&#x200B;

Eragon and the rest of the Inheritance Cycle isn't particularly great. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's nothing I would go around raving about today, as an adult with more refined taste and knowing what makes a story good, bad, or just about average. And yet, I am raving about how much I enjoyed this series. 

&#x200B;

I wouldn't call it a guilty pleasure, as I am sure some of you may be thinking. A guilty pleasure, to me, is something you know is bad but enjoy anyway, like me with Spider-Man 3. God that movie is awful, but I love it. With Eragon, it's different. I know what my guilty pleasures feel like, and this is something I am proud to say I love. Even after almost 24 years of stories, both games, movies, TV, and books, I have never felt this way about a series. It's in such an odd position. It's far from my favorite, but I will gladly place it among them. I can't really say I love these books. But I feel like I have to, so yeah, I love these books. 

&#x200B;

Sorry, this is just a long post after sitting gathering my thoughts about the series. It's been about a week since I finished and I still keep thinking about how I feel toward it. Anyone feel this way about any books they've read? I'd love to know I'm not alone in this weird purgatory of knowing a story isn't super great and proudly saying they think it's also super great.

&#x200B;

And before anyone says it, yes, I know of To Sleep in a Sea of Stars. Listened to it for a good amount. I don't think I'm a Sci-Fi fan. The book is good from what I listened to, I just don't care. I don't think I like Sci-Fi that much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jif7x6/eragon_is_not_particularly_good/,2020-10-26T14:10:49Z,61,97,books,Eragon,POST,Fantasy

q9qm4z,Eragon,"I know this is a series that everyone raves about. But am i the only one who couldnt get through the first book at all?

To put into perspective, ive been reading fantasy novels and other books since i was a kid. The length of the book doesnt intimidate me, and i truly applaud the imagination that is Eragon.

But man. Ive been trying on and off for years to get through more than half of the book. I always have to restart from the beginning because most of it is so forgettable to me. I cant stand how choppy and overly-detailed the narrative is. I also cant stand how moody Eragon himself is. As a teenager, i had tried speed reading through his parts because i thought he was whiny and unrelatable. I understood his uncle had been killed and he was mourning, but still, it felt like that mourning would go on forever with no development in sight.

As an adult now, i still pretty much stand by that. I still ask myself “when are we getting to the plot?” and “when is eragon going to have character development?”

It should be noted how much I respect this series. I truly do. It caught my attention much better than Lord of the Rings. I also know that the author was very young compared to other authors. This series is appreciated and loved by so many people and for reasons i can understand. And the author should be proud.

7twt8q,"About Christopher Paolini's ""Eragon"" and it's criticism. (Spoilers for ""Eragon"" and it's sequels inside)","I read the book Eragon when I was 14 and loved it, I wasn't really able to tell at the time, but it had something that really made it special to me. Fast forward some years and I have re-read the whole series more times that I can remember, and have a mostly free weekend, so I decide to check opinions and reviews online out of curiosity. What I find out is that the series was largely appreciated by many, but also received very harsh critics, so I want to explain why I don't share most of it. You are encouraged to disagree in the comments as long as you bring constructive criticism.

I am calling the series (whose proper name is ""Inheritance Cycle"") ""Eragon series"" because more people know it by that name.

I hope we can have a calm discussion about it, and this subreddit seems to be the best place, but if I'm breaking any rule (I think not), I will delete the post inmediately. There will be spoilers for the whole series, I hope the spoiler warning in the title is enough.

.

ADVERTISING

I have read many people complain about how dissapointed they were by X review that put the series and Paolini on a pedestal, or how bad the movie adaptation was. And while I do agree that unreal expectations or shitty adaptations can affect ones first experience, I also think it is unfair to put all the blame on the original story, specially if we don't know how involved Paolini was in those, or to expect other people to have the same feelings.

No I don't really mind there is a (in my opinion) terrible film adaptation, or that some columnist said Paolini was a visionary that was going to change literature at age 19. And while I don't believe that every piece of art should be judged only on it's own while ignoring the whole cultural landscape and the context in which it was created, for me, to completely ignore what the original material is and judge it only based on other's failures is going too far.

This is an ongoing thrend and I despise it, just read the reactions to the new Jumanji film. People are saying how these ""uneccesary reimaginings"" are just catchgrabs that ""ruined their childhood"". Producers are often lazy and will go back to formulas that have worked in the past, but it's also true that these new versions are a way to bring those stories back to a younger audience, and the whole debate is fascinating, but none of this should be affecting the original movie and our love for it, or at least not this much.

.

PAOLINI'S PROSE

One of the most common complains is that Paolini's writing is, simply put, bad, and while this is a good point, the problem comes when someone says that this alone is a reason to not read the series.

I haven't read the original text's, because I read the spanish translation of the books, so the translator's might have made it better (although it doesn't seem likely).I never felt the writing was so bad that it stopped me from enjoying the story, he isn't a genius writer, but there are some pieces that will be stuck in my head forever:

-The way he describes Shapira's egg as a blue diamond with tiny white veins, like a work of art that was polished to perfection.

-The passage where they visit the ""rock forest"", with trees that where turned into stones by some sort of catastrophe.

-The backstory of Durza and how its human host spiralled into madness until he made a deal that cursed him and the spirits forever, creating the tormented creatures that Shades are.

-The whole visit to Vroengard, with the calamities of the rider war still corrupting life into forms that shouldn't be and scape our logic.

And many more, his hyper detailed style makes every scene bloom with realism. And perhaps the word choice isn't the best, perhaps some of his metaphors suck, but he is deeply passionate about the story he is telling, and manages to communicate that. And this is something Paolini himself said in the books.

In the second book, ""Eldest"", there is an elven festival called ""Agaetí Blödhren"", the thing is that every elf and visitor is expected to bring some piece of art or craftmanship. Eragon decides to write a poem about his adventures, and the experiences he's had. He writes it in the ""Ancient language"", which makes it impossible for the speaker to lie. And when he finishes, and shows the poem to his master, they have this conversation (I'm translating here so it won't be 100% accurate)

-Clumsy, but honest.

-Do you like it?

-It's a good picture of your feelings, and the style hooks the reader, but it's no masterpiece. Did you expect it to be one?

-I guess I didn't.

-In any case, I'm surprised you managed to write it in this language. It is possible to write fiction and lie in the ancient language, but not to spoke those words later.

-I can read it, because I honestly think it's true.

-And that makes your writing much more powerfull... I'm impressed.

I think Paolini was proyecting himself here, and as someone that as tried to create art, but doesn't have the technical skills to do so, I feel moved by that sentiment. I am not saying that writers shouldn't pay attention to their prose, or that good writing is meaningless, but art can be more than simply that, it's what makes it special.

I have read many books that were technically excellent, authors that give new meanings to words I knew, and create sentences that show me other realities and worlds. I have read very few books that connected with me as an individual, stories I can relate with both at their best and at their worst.

.

PLAGIARISM AND INSPIRATION

By far, he most common criticism on the series, is that Paolini draws too many elements from other stories while adding close to nothing original. From LoTR he takes dragons, elves and dwarfs, from Earthsea the ancient language used by mages that describes things by their ""true name"" and allows to control the will of others. He takes significantly more from ""Star Wars"" (mainly the original film trilogy): the ancient order that was destroyed by an stray apprentice, the reveal that the main character's father was a villain, the old and disabled mentor... The list goes on, and there are other works of fiction in it.

But before explain why I feel that's not fair criticism, I am going to do precisely that. I will take a character from Eragon and compare it to a character from Star Wars, and all the paralelism between both. The thing is, I am not taking a character from the Original Trilogy, but from the Sequel Trilogy (which came out AFTER Eragon). Let's compare Murtagh and Kylo Ren. Oh, just in case, SPOILERS from ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi"". 

They both:

-have a past of abuse/neglect

-are the heir's of an evil figure they try to emulate

-are angry selfish assholes for the most part

-are antagonists to the main character

-reclaim the main character's sword, which was also used by the villain they look up to

-kill a paternal figure of the main character

-have an evil master that understimates them, and later rebel against them

-have a romantic interest they want to protect and that causes such rebelion

But ultimately, none of that matters, because the most important thing about those characters is the point the creator is trying to make with them, the message they want to send to the reader/spectator. Murtagh is a character that decides to break the cycle of abuse after finding there are things he wants to protect instead of destroying. Kylo Ren is a monster because he actively wants to be seen as one to hide his inner weakness, and wants to burn anything that scares him. (I think the scene where he shouts ""MORE"" repeatedly was pretty explicit about that)

I think that this is a case of inspiration rather than plagiarism, Paolini has stated once and again that he took ideas from previous authors, and mentioned the sources. And he manages to twist those concepts and give them a new meaning that made sense in the greater narrative of his story.

For example, Brom isn't just some Obi-Wan rip-off because his relationship with Morzan had nothing to do with the one between Obi-Wan and Anakin, he was treated like a pet by someone he considered a friend, and had to find the strenght to fight the man he had looked up to his whole life. Him watching over Eragon as he grew is special because Brom was secretly his father (which was a second twist after the Morzan one), and felt responsible for him, so he admonishes Eragon more often as a result during his training.

Every piece of art is partially inspired by previous work. Are we going to pretend the whole ""true name"" thing was invented by Le Guin, and that we've never heard of Rumpelstiltskin? That it doesn't have any parallels in Christian tradition? The Middle Earth was born from Tolkien's love of England and it's mithology. And it's no secret that George Lucas was inspired by samurai movies and eastern religions for Star Wars.

The most imaginative world ever created is meaningless compared to a setting that talks about issues we can relate with. Fiction isn't scapism, it's a way to look at our world from a different perspective.

DEUX EX MACHINA

A deux ex machina is a plot device that is lazy or comes out of nowhere, and is used to solve a problem that seemed to be impossible to solve.

There are many things in the series that people have labelled as such, but the two main ones are Eragon healing from his wounds in the end of the second book, and the spell he uses to defeat Galbatorix.

The problem is, they both fit perfectly with the themes the story has been developing since the first page.

The Inheritance Cycle talks about how people deal with scars (both physical and mental) and failure. Almost every named character has lived them, and the thing that draws the line between ""good"" and ""bad"" characters is how they deal with it. Nasuada and the  ""Trial of the Long Knives"", Oromis and his disability, Glaedr's leg, Galbatorix and his first dragon, Murtagh's scar... The character's that accept those experiences and try to adapt to them are ""good"", the ones that have unhealthy reaction are ""bad"". The only exception being the Ra'Zac, who are ""bad"" because... reasons, also their whole species is evil and deserves to be erradicated (shrug).

Leaving that apart, there is a whole chapter in ""Brisingr"" that is basically Eragon and Roran comparing their scars. Or the one in ""Eldest"" where Eragon has a discussion with Shapira, and she tells him to not give up on life just because of the pain.

It's what Elva's whole character is about, suffering is an intrinsic part of life, but we can't allow it to define us. This is a series where one of the most powerful characters is a five year old child whose only real power is to understand others.

That's why it doesn't feel ""out of nowhere"" for Eragon's back to heal after he has struggled with it and tried his best to continue his training despite his limitations.

That's why greatest most evil wizard of all time isn't defeated in a sword duel or overpowered with magic energy, he is defeated with empathy. Eragon cannot win a one on one fight, he is outskilled in every possible way, and when he realices that he has lost, that all the training and fighting have not been enough, when he feels all the weight of his failure and that he can't save the people he loves, he wishes to share that with Galbatorix, he want's him to care for others.

The all powerful tyrant literally goes down and starts sobbing because he can't handle the responsabilitiy of his own actions. To me, that is everything but ""cheap"". It is consistent. For Paolini, monsters are those that detach themselves from pain and refuse to be open about their feelings. I think that's a message worth spreading.

.

SUMMARY

I love Eragon. I love the whole series. It's a story that has spoken to me as a person and that has taught me things about myself I didn't knew, and I love it despite it's numerous flaws, to name a few: some cliches like the ""damsel in distress"" are overused without any depth to them, the writing can be lacking at times, some characters like the Ra'zac are treated and depicted very poorly, and under a ethically dangerous light.

I think it's important to consider both the good and the bad when criticising, a book, a film, a play, you choose. We shouldn't let ourselves be blinded by hate nor fanatism, because it prevents us from talking about the inner workings of a story, the things that make them stand out. With Eragon, I feel the discourse was more leaned to the side of hate, and I think that we couldn't talk about the specific issues it has as a story, and even worse, it made people feel guilty for liking something and caring about it.

One of the first reviews I read said that anyone who enjoyed the books should feel ashamed to call themselves a reader, and that they should go ""read some real fantasy"" like LoTR. I am not linking it here because I don't want to personally criticise someone for a two paragraph review they wrote a decade ago. But I can't think of a more toxic way to end that text, critics should give us a framework and lenses to look at art from their perspective, they should make us questions that we cannot make ourselves. Repeating the same point over and over without putting any real thought into its significance, jumping on a bandwagon to insult people who have a different opinion is the antithesis of that, and I feel that's what happened with Eragon. Perhaps I'm wrong.

And that's it. Thanks for reading this far to some dude talking about a book series that ended seven years ago, if you think you have something meaningful to say about this mess of a text, I will appreciate your comment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7twt8q/about_christopher_paolinis_eragon_and_its/,2018-01-30T00:01:40Z,52,59,books,Eragon,POST,Fantasy

wd2a7f,"Clones sagas: Harry Potter, Eragon = Star wars? any other?","It's been suggested that Harry Potter and Eragon are both Star Wars. And while the concept of the heroes journey and the chosen one who is orphaned are classic tropes in many stories, and I'm not really complaining... I am curious what other works are clones of not just star wars but part of the trend of cloning other works too.

any ideas?

Edit: oh for god sake, nobody is accusing of plagiarism or saying one of your pet favorites is poorly masked copies. The clone comment is a play on the clone wars in Star wars.

Everything is a remix and the heroes journey (which I mentioned) is a good exploration of finding the commonality in a lot of saga and mythic story styles.

""We open upon a scene where a Rebel Princess and her entourage are trying to steal away from the clutches of the evil Empire. At great cost, the Rebels have stolen a secret from the Empire that could give the Rebels a great advantage in defeating them. The Princess has been given the responsibility of transporting this dangerous secret. However, the Empire has tracked them down and sent fighters, under the leadership of a powerful General, to stop the Princess and retrieve the secret. The Princess is ambushed and captured, but at the last second manages to send the secret away in the hopes that it will come into the possessions of a former warrior that once helped the rebellion"" - Kevin Newsome on the story of star wars and Eragon.

11nnlvw,"Fantasy books that are primarily journeys (usually walking) are bad and lazy imo. *minor spoiler for before they are hanged, LOTR and Eragon and god killer","So I think books that are mainly journeys like mentioned in the title are plot devices for when you don’t have a plot. They’re just there so characters have something to do otherwise yiur books would be 50 pages long cause the authors can’t think of what to put between events so they just put walking. And even when walking the characters develment isn’t good

I’m mainly thinking of LOTR, Godkiller and Eragon.

The first 200 pages of LOTR is a walking simulator. And when 1/5 of the book is describing what kind of road they’re on with no character moments it’s poor in my opinion 

Same points with Eragon and Godkiller

The book that kinda subverts this is before they are hanged. Joe Abercrombie as written in a journey with a wizard and it end up being completely pointless.

28onwm,A new Eragon series...,"First off I want to say that I really enjoyed The Inheritance Cycle.  I think that Christopher Paolini did a magnificent job..I was pondering in the shower the other day, when I came apon a magnificent idea..

What if Christopher Paolini made another series that still had Eragon as a main character, but had other ""new"" or ""newer"" dragon riders..

This could potentially be a really good idea, imagine some mentally deranged antagonist is fighting Eragon and his riders.  for.. Lets say 50 years, or something similar.. 

In the first book, Eragon could finally recruit Arya, and they go through a very well thought out story line, and end up getting married, or whatever elves do...

The second, third, and fourth book could have Eragon and Arya spend even more years together...  They do as the elves do, the very magical and spectacular tribute to life and love.. Create a child.. This means that Eragon loves Arya just as much as he loves Saphira!  They and their dragons are all ONE.. They all know eachother as well as you can know anything.  They know their fighting style, eating habbits, moods, ideas, the way they think..  And All the while The dragon order is still fighting this mysterious Antagonist.

Then the fourth book... The Antagonist kills Arya!...  Eragon as well as saphira, are shattered, Eragon litterally loses the one mate in his life, the one person that has never been afraid of him, the one person that never let him lose himself..the one person that held his own ""heart of hearts""..  He goes crazy and then CP has Eragon finally do some Unhinged Fighting and kills the Antagonist..

What do you guys think?? I have ZERO writing skills, so should someone do a Fan Fiction about this?  Would it be worth it, Thoughts?

49j3a4,Eragon - A Tax-Evasion Crusade,"Eragon is a book about Eragon, a boy who hated his rulers because of high taxes. He also heard stories of Dragons and their Riders, thinking they are the coolest thing in the entirety of Alageisiwhatever. One day, he discovered a Dragon Egg, and decided to hatch it, because not only is it extremely cool to become a Dragon Rider, but also because he can use his dragon to force taxes to lower.

Upon hatching his Dragon, Galbatorix, the ruler of the kingdom Eragon is in, decided to reclaim the dragon because he deemed giving a peasant a dragon a bad thing (mostly because he really wanted to have a proper dragon rider, but also because he don't want to lower taxes. He could have just asked Eragon nicely, and offered to lower taxes if Eragon had come with him to become a Dragon Rider, but then he said 'Why not send a bunch of man-eating bird-things after Eragon?'). Eragon managed to escape, and started heading to the Varden, a community that he heard from his tales that has experience with dragons.

He was followed by Brom, who tried to manipulate him into wanting to actually kill Galbatorix instead of just convincing him to lower taxes. Blah blah blah. He goes into a forest of tree-hugging hippies that taught him that they have in fact been updated and will no longer be angry at him if he tried to trade their own wooden goods back.

I think he went to a dwarf-city before that, but then it got attacked by a titan/forgotten beast or something. Just a bunch of Dwarf Fortress references there, including a scene where he cursed a child to be always bitten by carp, when he meant to prevent the child from being bitten by carp. Just a bunch of random FUN stuff.

Anyway, once he completed his training, he decided to go after the things Galbatorix sent him, simply because he desires revenge. So he just went in and slaughtered them all. Well, he thought, that was a job well done, and I have certainly gained a lot of ""Swordsmanship"" experience, and I am currently a Legendary +5 swordsman with ridiculous Strength, Agility, Toughness and Endurance. Let's put my training to good use. Also, I should probably be a Vampire Necromancer.

(I know this book isn't based on Dwarf Fortress, but honestly, the book is so bad that changing a bit of things won't make a difference)

Anyway, Eragon got tangled up in some politics that he does not understand, because politics are for adult people and Eragon is just a kid who wants Galbatorix to lower taxes. After the adults did some politics, they agreed that:

1). Galbatorix will die and thus will no longer be able to tax people.

2). Nasuada will become a tree-hugging puppet. That's what you get for trying to bargain with tree-huggers who are 10 times stronger than you (and can actually use magic). Don't make the same mistake as Nasuada, guys. Always drown tree-huggers in magma.

3). Humanity will be subjugated by the tree-huggers, and will no longer be able to trade with the Dwarves, since King StarkRavingMad, a precursor to King Orik of the Dwarves, has angered the tree-huggers by selling them their own wooden bins back when Elves have extreme short-term memory.

Eragon thought the first was a very appealing proposal, and to hell with the rest of humanity. After all, he already had pointy ears and felt like a true tree-hugging hippie. So he went to Rhunon, an elf who isn't actually a tree-hugger (Rhunon is Cacame Awmedinade the Immortal Onslaught, Elven ing of the Dwarves in disguise, after all. I mean, both of them aren't hippies and wield hammers as their primary weapon/blacksmithing tool), to have a replacement blade forged.

Wait, so now we have:

Nasuada, The Elves' Puppet-King, Future Puppet-Ruler of the Humans

Arya Stark, Best Stark Ever, And Future Ruler of the Elves

Rhunon (who is Cacame Awemidinade, Elven King of the Dwarves in disguise)

So the Elves rule everything by proxy?

This sucks. I was just joking about the last, though. Dwarf-King is still Orik. At least there will be one non-puppet non-elf king.

I don't think Eragon cared, though. Well, at least he didn't care as he assaulted Galbatorix's land, killed his soldiers, and pretty much threw a temper tantrum all over Galbatorix's lands.

So he reached Galbatorix. The final boss. The one. The only. The king with a thousand dragons, who collected thousands of tax money  from thousands of village.

Including Carvahall.

This won't do to Eragon. He must teach that ruler-bastard a lesson in not imposing high taxes on his people.

So he casted a spell in Galbatorix, causing him to experience the crushing debt of the taxes he imposed on his people.

He wasn't able to take it anymore. He stumbled forward, and he casted a spell to self-destruct.

His lasts words were ""Please, no more taxes!"". Kinda ironic, since he has been imposing taxes on his entire country.

Eragon did a simple shielding spell he learned from the Elves (this is DF2020, which had elves casting shield-spells to make up for their weakness in wooden swords. BTW Rhunon made a metal one for Eragon because she is secretly an ELVEN KING OF THE DWARVES, so of course a KING OF THE DWARVES will know how to work metal)

---------

Aftermath: Eragon managed to kill Galbatorix. The source of taxes. The one who is anti-Dragon, and thus not cool. However, he didn't account for one thing:

There will still be taxes under Nasuada's rule. In fact, the Elves have forced Nasuada to increase the tax rate from 75% of crops to 90% of crops.

That really sucks. Eragon was sick and done with it. No matter what ruler is on the throne, there will still be taxes.

So he left.

The last time anyone saw him is when he flipped off Arya, cursing her to eternal tax-damnation.

And that was the end of our story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/49j3a4/eragon_a_taxevasion_crusade/,2016-03-08T15:56:53Z,2,5,books,Eragon,POST,Fantasy

da2ksp,The chronicles of Narnia,"I have just finished reading the TCON series and I have mixed feelings about the books. Although, I do believe that the books are extremely good for someone who is trying to make reading a habit as the vocabulary/ language used is not overwhelming and pretty easy to understand. Please do not be put off by my post, this is simply my opinion.

The best book in the series is the first instalment (The Magician's Nephew). I have to say that the first book is extremely well structured compared to some of the other instalments in the series and I actually enjoyed reading it. It pretty much explains the whole back story about Aslan, the White Witch and the creation of Narnia. The worst book in the series was the 4th instalment 'The Dawn Treador'. I thought the whole story line for that particular book was quite arbitrary and not well structured at all, it sort of killed the books after that. It had many different events without any legitimate/ real reasoning behind it. I hated reading it and I ended up forcing myself to read the last 3 books which took a while lol.

I may be being harsh, however, that is because I am comparing TCON series to other fictional series such as Harry Potter which completely blows TCON out of the water except The Magicians Nephew.

I’ve recently been into fantasy lately, and I’m reading Lord of the Rings right now. I’ve also bought the Chronicles of Narnia since I’ve never really experienced it before, and I plan to read it. (Always loved an immersive story)

When I saw these books (all the works were compiled into one book), I was in awe of how big they are. It tells me they were well-crafted, have thought put in them, and are probably very immersive. 

However, I looked them up online to see what people thought of them. They both got great reviews, but it turns out that Narnia and LOTR, were originally made for kids/younger people. 

I sort of frowned at this. So, I guess I’m curious as to what you all think about an adult (19) reading books generally aimed at children.

I’m still planning to finish and read both, and I’m no stranger to mature stories (Stephen King, Bret Easton Ellis to name some) either way. Thanks for your time!

I've always wanted to tackle these books in a more educational (and adult) setting and give them a much deeper look.

As writers and hopeful scholars, we are reading the series in publication order.


I want this to be in the most kick-ass book discussion that ever was and would love ALL TEH RESOURCES! Please give me any suggestions! What would **you** do?


I'd love direction on where to find scholarly articles open source. When I was at University, we had lovely access to many journals, but as a graduate, I no longer have this resource.


Does anyone have any super-specific in-depth questions they've always wondered after a re-reading? Or questions that handle motifs/themes over multiple books. What are obscure things you noticed on a repeat reading?


Our discussion will certainly not be limited to religion(/mythology/folklore), but have a strong structural component. As writers, we're all about the world building, character development/motivation, conflict, allegory, etc.


I hesitate to ask this here, but companion books that you've had positive experiences with would be great as well.

jqqxx7,The Chronicles or Narnia reading order controversy???,"Hello guys. I am currently reading the chronicles of narnia for the first time in chronological order. I'm on the voyage of dawn treader rn. Anyway, I was wondering why there is all the fuss about the reading order. I've seen many people insist on the publication order, but idk why. Can someone help me understand why? What's the big deal, what's wrong with the chronological order ( the lion witch wardrobe still reads as the best book even in publication order). Why the publication order? I'm just curious as to why people are debating as to which order is better. Personally, I think the chronological order is best, but I want to hear from the other side. Makes much more sense in CO (chronological order) IMHO, although its not in my place to judge and I'm not sure how it'll read in publication order. Im curious about that too. For reference, can someone please post both orders. This, and also, have a good day, and for those of you who are going to read the chronicles of narnia, read it. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jqqxx7/the_chronicles_or_narnia_reading_order_controversy/,2020-11-09T04:29:00Z,30,25,books,Narnia,POST,Fantasy

2r1y2j,"My fiance and I rekindled our love for the Chronicles of Narnia books and I was inspired to create my own ""cinematic interpretation"" of C.S. Lewis' masterpiece, ""The Magician's Nephew"".","I remember reading The Magician's Nephew as a kid and connecting with it more than the rest of the books. After giving my fiance an e-reader for Christmas, she downloaded The Chronicles Of Narnia series and I started reading ""The Magician's Nephew"" again after so many years. 

I had completely forgotten how epic a book it was and was blow away by the amount of allegory and metaphor. I immediately started dreaming up a film adaptation and was inspired enough to cut together a clip-o-matic trailer of various clips that would represent my version of the Narnia universe. 

I love the themes of Good vs Evil, the Loss of Innocence, the whole creation of the Universe/Narnia scene. and I started thinking of various movies that I could use to tell the story of ""The Magician's Nephew"". I found a bunch of clips from movies like The Tree of Life, Noah, The Secret Garden and decided to use a clip from National Geographic as Aslan as I wanted my interpretation to be a little more raw and real. 

Anyways, [check out the full trailer here](http://youtu.be/S1wl5wLSNjs?list=PLvxEcSoNRVCVS1bGPK-VzkYsdLhcwKJiB) and let me know what you think! I tried to stay as faithful to the book as possible though obviously there are going to be differences. It was really fun to make and I hope to make more interpretations of my favourite classics.

11j6tme,The Silver Chair - Legend of Tannhäuser,"Recently came across a version of Legend of Tannhäuser from a collection of popular tales from the Norse and north German published in 1907. Starting from the skeleton of this story and draping the world of Chronicles of Narnia over it would explain what we get in The Silver Chair. Included is the ideas of enchantment and temptation of the green witch and her underground kingdom.

Anyone pick up on this connection before? Are there other stories you have found that inspired larger narrative elements within Chronicles of Narnia books? Curiously, I do not see much reference to this interplay between The Silver Chair and Legend of Tannhäuser discussed elsewhere.

In the Legend of Tannhäuser the travels of a knight lead to invitation to competition at the court of Dame Venus. Who it is revealed lives in an underworld caverns below a mountain. She is described as giving friends the most exquisite pleasures earth can afford, both of silver and gold of abundance. Another is met along the way who claims for 300 years has been employed in warning those away from the temptations of the Venus Mount. He warns to stay away from the mountain lest the temptress entangle thee in her net. The knight travels to the court of Venus anyway. To have a look considering that if it looks amiss he can turn and leave before being ensnared.

> *As the mountain is approached discordant sounds resolve into harmony.* Through a door in the rock they could see knights, beautiful women, and dwarfs. All seemed to be enjoying themselves utmost. At the entrance sat a fair woman in royal robes. The moment she saw Tannhäuser she smiles, and signed to him to approach. Eckhard in the same moment entreated him by all he held sacred to *beware of the temptress, who was outwardly like an angel of light, but inwardly a fiend incarnate.* He would have said more, *but Venus interrupted him by beginning to sing a wondrous song about the joys that awaited those who entered her kingdom; and Tannhäuser, as thoroughly enchanted as though a magic spell had been cast over him, thrust Eckhard aside, and hastened to the queen of beauty, who stretched her arms out to him*. She half drew him over the threshold, and he half staggered across. Then the door shut, and the faithful Eckhard saw him no more.

The main point of the legend describes how every day brought new pleasures, which the knight enjoyed to the utmost.

> But at length began to tire of it, and confessed himself that satiety was not happiness. He had a horror of himself, and of the self-indulgent life he was leading; and his conscience, once awake, left him no peace. Rest of the story describes his effort to escape and return to his prior life in which all he had held important was put on hold.

Core elements of The Silver Chair are all there. Adventure to the far north to seek out a mountain with entrance to the underground kingdom. The temptress witch using music and enchantment to ensnare. The witch turning into a snake is a visible depiction of the inward fiend incarnate. Time lost in those depths. The long road traveling back out of the underworld. The most vivid parts of The Silver Chair are those that map closest to Legend of Tannhäuser.

Interesting story to stumble on. Raises questions what other sources in the cauldron of storytelling were used by CS Lewis to craft the larger works.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11j6tme/the_silver_chair_legend_of_tannhäuser/,2023-03-05T18:30:26Z,2,11,books,Narnia,POST,Fantasy

am6g7v,Just finished The Golden Compass,"Hi Everyone, first time poster but long time lurker.

Any ways, as the title says, I finished reading the Golden Compass last night. I'm a casual reader, and read about a chapter a night. I really enjoyed the book but have been trying to think critically about some of the themes and was hoping y'all could enlighten me and maybe give some perspective on what you read and your interpretation of the story as a whole and specific plot points as well, if you're so inclined. 

As a background, I begun reading The Golden Compass as I heard that HBO/BBC will soon be releasing a live action version soon and wanted to have read the story before it releases. Also, I read somewhere the the His Dark Materials trilogy is sort of an antithesis of The Chronicles of Narnia (which I read ages ago and thoroughly enjoyed). I'm very non-religious and consider myself an atheist (which I know is ironic because I enjoyed The Chronicles of Narnia but I was a teen when I read those).

Also, it's worth noting that I have The Subtle Knife loaded on my Kindle and will be reading that next!

8s10xv,Thoughts on The Magicians by Lev Grossman: a rant (includes many spoilers)," (SPOILERS) 

Okay, so I finished The Magicians by Lev Grossman a few days ago, and these thoughts have been stewing in my mind since. I had the book recommended to me by two people in my life, one who said it was one of their favorite books, and one who said that I would hate the main character, but the story is okay. I love to read, so I figured I'd pick it up. I figured that I'd at least appreciate the premise. I love magic worlds, and I wanted to see what Lev Grossman did with ""magic college"". 

Oh man, what a mistake that was. If anyone really does love this book, full disclosure, I'm about to rake it over the coals. There are just so many things about this story that are pet peeves of mine, that I honestly am not sure if I can say I enjoyed reading it or not. It's one of those books that kind of redeemed itself at the end, but it took so freaking long to get there that I'm not sure if it was worth my time. But anyway, here are my issues with the book. 


**The Main Character**

To be fair, my friend did warn me about Quentin Coldwater. Or at least, she tried. But I don't think anything could have prepared me for how much this kid makes me want to rip my eyes out. Never in my life have I read a character who was more entitled, self-serving, weak, whiny, self-absorbed, or freaking pathetic as Quentin is. It's unbearable. I'm not sure if the author was trying to be ironic? Or something? But it's torture. Everything is about him, and the world freaking revolves around him. He takes no responsibility for anything. He's the quintessential ""I'm failing because my teacher hates me"" while simultaneously not handing in homework kind of kid. He's unhappy because his life sucks, and his life sucks because the people around him make his life suck (obviously not because he has a crappy mindset or anything). The opening pages are filled with him lamenting how his best girl friend is dating his best guy friend instead of him (because he's such a catch), and I almost stopped reading there. You would think that as the story and the years progressed, he'd mature a little. But no. He doesn't. After 5 years of magic college, he's still the same whiny, entitled little crybaby that he was at the beginning of the book. He expects everything to be handed to him on a silver platter, and when it isn't (because he hasn't worked for it), he blames everyone but himself. Relationship falling apart? It's because his girlfriend is too busy. Classmate gets a better grade then him? Must be because he cheated. Quentin thinks he's God's gift to mankind, and it's gets really old, really fast. I understand the benefit of unlikeable characters - watching them lose, recover, and grow - but Quentin doesn't grow. He's stagnant. And on top of that, he sucks. The supporting characters are great though, at least some of them, but Quentin is irredeemable in my eyes. It made for a rocky reading experience.


**The World**

If there is a plot in this book, it doesn't start until about 3/4 of the way through the book (more on that later), but up until that point it feels like...filler? Like the whole point of me reading about magic college is that I want to experience magic college. I want to know what classes you take, what majors there are, how magic works, what jobs there are, what the students are like, and so on. Surprisingly, the book doesn't get into any of that. We meet a handful of characters (all of whom are important 3/4 of the way through the book), but other than that, the school could be empty for all we know. There's no backbone to this story. There's no detail. There's no scope. It follows Quentin's narrowminded worldview with an equally narrowminded storytelling style, which I guess could also be intentional and ironic, but it makes for a crappy book. I want to know what the school LOOKS like. What do students do for fun? What class do they have to take? What classes can they elect to take? What is class like? And like, other than the boring ones? Are all of them boring? What are they learning? What are the students in the other disciplines like? What do they do? Why don't the different disciplines talk to one another? If the professors teach so many of the students' classes, how come we barely see them? Why are magicians so lackluster and aimless once they graduate? Why haven't they coordinated into groups that can actually do good? What about magic hospitals? Magic architects? Magic toymakers? Why is everyone so self-centered and gross? I felt betrayed by the ""magic college"" hype. This book was hyped as gritty Harry Potter, and I was left feeling like it was more like gritty Harry Potter, but with every 5th word removed. There was no backstory, or worldbuilding, or wonder. Hell, even magic was explained in the book as ""it just works, better not question it"", which again, maybe was supposed to be ironic? Maybe? But it comes across as laziness. I kept expecting the details to get better and more engaging, but every page was just Quentin Quentin Quentin and it bothers me to know end that the boy who's eyes I have to see through has no interest in anything but himself. As a result, the world is empty. 


**Hello, Plagiarism**

This is my biggest freaking issue with this book. Holy cow. Where to begin. So as previously mentioned, the story in this book doesn't really start until 3/4 of the way through, but in order to prove my point here, I have to back up aaaaaall the way to the beginning. See, there's this series that Quentin reads as a child: Fillory and Further, written by some guy name Plover, an English novelist back in the early 1900s. Quentin loves these books. They're his escape from the real world, which, in retrospect, is really the only relatable and understandable aspect of Quentin's entire character. There are five books in this series, all centered around a family of five young children (the Chatwicks) who travel to a magical land called Fillory at the behest of the land's gods. These children help Fillory solve some pretty serious problems via quests given to them by the gods, and then they are sent home until they are summoned again. 


Sound familiar?


What if I told you that the only way to get to Fillory was through furniture? Things like grandfather clocks. Or perhaps wardrobes. 


Sounds a lot like The Chronicles of Narnia, right? Oh, you bet it does. And guess what? That's just the freaking beginning, friends. 


Fillory has rules. Like, you can't just show up. You have to be summoned. And only human children can sit on the thrones of Fillory. Time also acts really funny in Fillory: a hundred years could pass, but in the ""real world"", no time passes at all. When the Chatwicks first arrive in Fillory, they serve as Kings and Queens of the land until they are sent back to their world by the gods (I don't remember when exactly this happens, there are five books in this series within a series, but it happens during one of them). After that, each Chatwick returns, taking one other younger sibling with them. They explore Narnia (sorry, I mean, Fillory) and complete quests until they are sent home. At the end of the fifth book, however, the siblings are granted rings, five of them, one for each Chatwick. They serve as portals, and can be used to go to Fillory at any time. Upon returning to the real world, the older sibling hides the rings from the youngest, because that's not how Fillory is supposed to work, one does not simply ""pop in"" on Fillory, yada yada yada. And then the series ends. That's it. Caput.


So the rings are important, right? And 3/4 of the way through the book (the real one, not the five book series) one of the characters appears with one of the rings. And of course they all go through the ""no way, Fillory isn't real"" spiel that is to be expected, and Quentin is all jealous that he didn't find the way to Fillory, but they go, right? Expect that the ring doesn't take you directly to Fillory. No, there's a layover period. A bus stop. 


Anyone ever read The Magician's Nephew, book 1 of the Chronicles of Narnia? You know how the two main characters get these magic rings, that transport them to this in-between world with all these puddles of water? And when you jump into one of these puddles while wearing the ring, it transports you to another world, and that's how they get to Narnia the first time? Well, would you like to read that book again, but by some dude name Lev Grossman? Well, then, you're in for a treat. 


IT'S THE SAME FREAKING PREMISE. Like, I understand that C. S. Lewis doesn't hold a monopoly on water-dimension-travel-via-ring here, but c'mon, Grossman doesn't even try to HIDE it. The main characters are transported to this place called Neitherwhere (or something), an in-between world where time is meaningless and you can get lost very, very, easily. It is made up of many, many adjacent squares. At the center of each square is a fountain. If you jump into the fountain wearing the ring you get transported to another world and OH LOOK IT'S THE SAME FREAKING STORY well done, Grossman. Good job coming up with that one all by yourself. Anyway that's how they get to Fillory. 


After that the story picks up (because, you know QUEST and all that) and they learn that a human hasn't been on the throne since the Chatwicks and Fillory is in disarray (oh no) and these magicians are the only ones who can save Fillory (of course) and so they try, and some of them die, and then they all go back to Earth because Fillory isn't as glamorous as they thought, and then at the end of the book, when Quentin is all like ""magic ain't for me, I'm gonna be an office worker but not do any real work but still get paid because MAGIC, I guess"" his friends show back up (the ones who didn't die) and are like ""we're going back to Fillory to be Kings and Queens and there are four thrones (FOUR FREAKING THRONES GUYS) and we already have two queens and one king and we need another king (TWO KINGS TWO QUEENS GUYS) wanna be the other king?"" and Quentin is like ""sure, whatever"" and jumps out a window to join them. I forgot to mention that they were all flying, but Quentin jumping out a window is actually a pretty fitting end, tbh. 


And that's it, folks. That's The Magicians by Lev Grossman, aka The Chronicles of Narnia, aka the book critics have described as ""original"" HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY BE ORIGINAL IT'S LITERALLY NARNIA. Anyway. There are a ton more Narnia references that I've forgotten because it's honestly hard to keep track of them all. Also Grossman blatantly references Harry Potter in his book as like a ""what, you think we do that fake magic crap with wands?"" and describes wand wizards as weak, and you know what, sure, go ahead, but it certainly makes him sound like a limp noodle and doesn't really win him any points in my book because his book like, sucks. 


Thanks for reading. Sorry if you liked this book. Let me know how you guys all feel about it, because I'm seeing red right now. I don't even like, LOVE Narnia or anything, it's just the principle. I can't believe he got away with this, tbh.

8ll95e,So I just finished The Magician's Nephew (Discussion),"Hey y'all,

So of course I'm familiar with the Chronicles of Narnia, one thing I regret, I never read the books in elementary school because apparently 8 year-old me said ""eh, I saw the movie, I don't need the books"". Boy was this book entertaining. I think it was a good change of pace for me because I've been going through some stuff in my personal life, so it was nice to read a story that was a little bit more optimistic. I would say that I got converted to fantasy thanks to the movie Pan's Labyrinth and other books by Neil Gaiman so I decided to check this series out for its high praise and its influence in fantasy. This book really did feel alive to me and I loved that the characters felt real. Honestly I can't think from the top of my head any flaws or something that bothered me, maybe the uncle but that was part of his character and he does receive his justice.

Overall, I can't wait to read the rest of the books and see how this journey ends. Also I wanted to ask what are y'all your favorite book of the series? So far the first book did set the tone perfectly and I can't wait to see what comes next!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8ll95e/so_i_just_finished_the_magicians_nephew_discussion/,2018-05-23T17:33:17Z,29,33,books,Narnia,POST,Fantasy
86o68i,The Wood between the Worlds,"I was recently reading a thread from a reader that loves to look at their book collection and feel proud of finishing each of their books, much as one would feel proud of a “conquest”.  [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7zmrza/on_the_joy_of_finishing_books/)

But it got me thinking about how my husband and I love to stand in front of our bookshelves and reminisce about all the worlds we’ve been a part of and the friends we’ve made in these worlds.  

It reminded me of the Wood between the Worlds in The Magicians Nephew (book 6 of the Chronicles of Narnia).  In it, the main characters find themselves in a wood that seems to be in another dimension.  It is filled with countless puddles of water.  Each of these puddles represents a different world/universe filled with its own characters and settings.  

I feel like our bookshelves are the Wood between the Worlds and each book represents a puddle that is a link to another world.  This just works perfectly because bookshelves and books are (generally) literally made from trees.    

I love that imagery and just thought I’d share!

aqo7cv,Love for the Short Story Format: An Ode to Collections,"I have loved to read since I was a child and have regularly cracked behemoth tomes of literary treasures. And series that stretched for books and books. From Lord of the Rings, to Chronicles of Narnia. 

&nbsp; 

But my true love will always lie with the short story format. Recently I've completed The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury, a compilation of Man's Ascent to Mars, with terrifying stories like ""There Will Come Soft Rains"" and ""The Third Expedition"". And two altogether different kind of terrifying collections ""Bazaar of Bad Dreams"" and ""Everything's Eventual"" both by King. 

&nbsp; 

If you also find yourself a lover of the Short Story from H.G. Wells ""Magic Shop"" to Jackson's ""Lottery"", I'd encourage you to check out McSweeney's. In a recent swap n shop, I picked up two thrilling collections, ""NOISY OUTLAWS, UNFRIENDLY BLOBS, AND SOME OTHER THINGS…"" and ""McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales. I plan on making them a staple in my home library and my wife and daughter are enthralled in the evenings by our story times.

9qa2yg,"Parents, librarians, etc.: what are the kids reading nowadays?","Hello! I am a teacher-in-the-making for Grades 3-6 (think: 7- to 12-year-olds) who is compiling resources and ideas in advance as to not be completely blind after my professional education is completed. While I know what I used to read as a kid, what the classics are, what some of the popular book series are, etc., I figured I would ask the experts i.e. people who work actively with books, are already teachers, are parents, and whoever else may have any ideas to pitch. My goal is to set up a mini library in my classroom that has a wide variety of genres (fiction and non-fiction + graphic novels) so that during the traditional silent reading time, there is always something on hand that will be of some interest to more or less every kiddo and that has been ""vetted"" in advance. As well, the mini library will be a great way to highlight Canadian and minority contributions to children's literature, while also still being relatively accessible and fun. Authors and series in French and English are welcomed as I will eventually be in a French Immersion classroom. A variety of ""levels"" of reading is also appreciated given that not every kiddo will have the same competency and speed, especially as classrooms become even more diversified (see: allophones).

&#x200B;

Note that I plan to encourage critical reading skills in the classroom while also underlining reading as being fun in general; thus, ""junk food"" books like Captain Underpants may be borrowed from the library during visits, but would not appear in my mini in-class assortment. Book ideas I have so far include, but are not limited to:

* The Dear Canada series;
* The Dear America Royal Diaries series;
* Anne of Green Gables;
* A Series of Unfortunate Events;
* Harry Potter series;
* The Bailey School Kids series;
* The Babysitter's Club series;
* The Chronicles of Narnia series;
* Studio Ghibli graphic novels;
* Theme- and age-appropriate manga and comics akin to visual novels (thus, no Archie comics, for example);
* Novels by Kenneth Oppel, Roald Dahl, Farley Mowat, and Cornelia Funke;
* Novels that are dual-translated English-French on either side of the page (from Librairie du soleil bookstore);
* \[Insert some kind of mystery novel series here that is not dull like Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys\];
* \[Insert Canadian, French Canadian and minority Canadian authors' children's literature works here\]; 
* \[Insert some kind of SciFi series here\]; and
* The typical inclusion of atlases, dictionaries, dual translation dictionaries, thesauruses, visual encyclopedia and dictionaries, etc.

Feedback is much appreciated and will be added to my list! I intend on reading the books prior to including them in the mini library and will be re-reading quite a few of the ones mentioned above to make sure I am not misremembering their content. I also have to make sure they are still relevant to today's kiddies as much has changed in the past 15-20 years.

33hdn7,Question about the reading order of R. A. Salvatore's Legend of Drizzt Series,"Okay, so I was pretty interested in taking a look at R. A. Salvatore's Legend of Drizzt series, since I've heard very good things, and Baldur's Gate II is one of my favorite games of all time. Was never too into D&D, but I'm pretty interested.

I'm finding myself pretty confused by the current ordering of the series though: the novel ""The Crystal Shard"" (part of the Icewind Dale Trology) was the first one published, and yet it is listed as the fourth book in the series. Instead, books 1, 2, and 3 are listed as the prequel trilogy that he wrote after the Icewind Dale trilogy was finished.

I'm always really wary of renumbering like this, especially since Chronicles of Narnia was completely renumbered and was apparently butchered in the process, and most people tell new readers to completely ignore the official numbering and focus on publication date.

I know sometimes authors can revise their series later on, like Stephen King did with his Dark Tower series. He edited some of the earlier books, and even inserted a new novel into the series that he says should be read where it fits chronologically, even though he wrote it last. I haven't heard anything like that here, and I thought the prequels were supposed to be read second, since they were written second.

What's the real intended/recommended reading order here? And what do you guys think of when publishers change the numbering of a series like this? Not that it was the publisher necessarily, I have no idea if this was Salvatore's idea or theirs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/33hdn7/question_about_the_reading_order_of_r_a/,2015-04-22T15:15:48Z,14,7,books,Narnia,POST,Fantasy

When I looked on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_L%27Engle#Selected_works) I learned that there are three additional books not in the Time Quintet (The Arm of the Starfish, Dragons in the Waters, and A House Like a Lotus) that take place in the same universe and that the final book in the quintet actually takes place after the events of those three.  

The page mentions that there's connections in those additional three books to another series she wrote (Chronos).

It also mentioned that:

> Further overlaps between characters connect virtually every L'Engle novel into one massive series of books.

I was hoping someone who has read them all could explain which book relates to which other book and what order they appear in chronologically.

wmi7ty,The best books ever written; a meta-analysis of the internet's lists.,"I think most of us here have come to the realisation that there are too many books, and too little time to read them all. This raises what I consider a bigger problem: If I can only read a finite number of books in my lifetime, how do I choose what books to read?

Personally, I have always wanted to read the books considered the best and most influential to literature and greater society. However, I was having difficulty finding a list that I considered an acceptable interpretation of this question. Several internet communities, media publications and academics have published their own version of what they consider either the ‘best’ or ‘most influential’ books, but many of these contained so much variety and potential for individual preference that I couldn’t take just one of them as my essential source. So, I decided to analyse and combine the data from approximately 20 of these lists.

The most robust resource I could find for this project was thegreatestbooks.org, a website that combines the data of 130 different lists. However, this algorithm contains rules that result in certain lists counting more than others, such as lists voted by authors and experts counting more than user-generated lists. Personally, I would have taken the opposite approach, however it nonetheless provided an excellent resource for a starting dataset.

My process was as follows; I created a list by taking the top 500 titles from thegreatestbooks algorithm and giving them all a “score” of 1 (meaning that they have been mentioned in a list once). I then chose approximately 20 other lists from a variety of sources, including Reddit, 4Chan, Time Magazine, The Reader’s Digest, and so on. Whenever a title that was already in the original 500 was mentioned again, it received another “point” and its score was raised by one. Furthermore, whenever a book that was not on the original 500 was listed, it was added and given a starting score of 1.

I repeated this process until I had a list of 1000 books, and then ranked these books based on how many times they were mentioned. Finally, I culled every book that only had a score of 1, meaning they had only made it onto a single list (including those listed in the original 500 and never listed again). This resulted in a final catalogue of 556 books.

A couple of things before the list. Firstly, I think it is important to note that some of the lists were not stated as the “best” books of all time, but rather the “most influential,"" and so on. I do not believe the rankings on this list to be indicative of a title being objectively “better” than any other book on this list but is more likely a representation of popularity and influence that specific book has had. This is at the end of the day just another list and it shouldn’t be considered anything more than a primitive piece of data-analysis.

The following is the top scoring 302, all with at least 3 mentions. Due to Reddit's character limit, the books with two mentions are listed in the comments.

ngm95,Would anyone be interested in a free PDF copy of my book The Orphan King?  ,"I've had numerous friends and family read it and now I'm looking for a few kind strangers that are willing to give me their honest opinions.

It's called The Orphan King and it's a homage to children's fantasy adventure novels, such as The Wizard of Oz and The Chronicles of Narnia, but written with a far darker, more disturbing, Brothers Grimm style. I like to say that it's like Alice in Wonderland meets Dante's Inferno.

The Orphan King tells the tale of an abused ten year old orphan boy named Lewis who suffers a violence so severe that it breaks his mind in two, causing his subconscious to create a hellish fantasy world inside his psyche that he escapes into in order to flee the harsh realities of the real world around him. The only problem is that this fantasy world inside his head is far worse than anything the real world has to offer.

Please note that The Orphan King is intended for mature readers. It is very violent and deals with a lot of adult subject matters such as child abuse, insanity, death, religion, torture and so on and so forth.

If you are interested please email me at TheOrphanKing@gmail.com and I will send you a free PDF copy. Thank you for your time.

rrpihk,"My booklist of the ""sober fantasy"" genre that I've always looked for but never found so I decided to make it myself.","Hey y'all, first post on r/books, figured here was a good place to do what the title describes. When I say ""sober fantasy"" what I'm trying to describe are the books that are wildly fantastical and imaginative yet can be read through a deeply thoughtful, philosophical, or spiritual lens. BTW I am 19 years old and have not had a ton of time to read a million books so please let me know of any books that might belong on this list so that I can eat them with my brain.

1. C.S. Lewis' *Chronicles of Narnia*: My favorite book series of all time. Such deeply and lovingly crafted worldbuilding with character complexes that range from simple to heroic to deeply complex. The books were written apparently as fairy tales for children, but it seems that children in the 50's were a wildly different audience than modern children. The language is old and I have always found this to be more entertaining to myself as it makes it harder to imagine a modern person writing it and makes it a little bit more old-fairy-talish. Also, C.S. Lewis' journey with spirituality, Christianity, and God is so interesting to me and the implicit and explicit biblical allegories laid within the stories add a quality to the series that is hard for me to find elsewhere. *(side note, I am a drug addict in recovery through Alcoholics Anonymous and I read this series at the beginning of my sobriety when I was 17 and it was a wonderful launchpad for developing my conception of God, my internal spirituality, and my moral compass).*
2. C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy: Similar to Narnia yet told in a very different way in a completely different setting. I love sci-fi and I love fantasy, as a book written before the first visit to space, the descriptions of space and other planets are so beautiful and imaginative and are very fresh air for someone like me who reads Frank Herbert books and is getting a little bit tired of his sci-fi jargon (JK I love you Frank RIP my boy). Anyways, it's also interestingly tied in with Lewis' conversion from atheism to Christianity as the second book is pretty much playing entirely upon one biblical allegory. Love these books and they offer a perfect mixture of sci-fi, fantasy, spirituality, and overall thoughtfulness.
3. *The Last Unicorn* by Peter S. Beagle: The book that inspired me to write this list. The title initially made me a little bit sick with how corny it sounded but I have never been more wrong. This is the epitome of this whole list- ridiculously whimsical, even self-referencing itself as a fairy tale by the characters, yet so solemn and at times tragic, exploring the feelings of a character who is the last of their kind and searching frantically yet reluctantly to prove that they are not in fact alone in the world. The way that so many myths and tales are brought together in this book is so creative and unique and it was one of those books that I only managed to put down two or three times before finishing it.
4. *Grendel* by John Gardner: A much more difficult read than the previous three books on the list, yet all the same another perfect example of the SFT subgenre. Characters pulled straight out of one of the oldest surviving fairy tales Beowulf and written about in a way that's equally as modern as it is true to its roots; a complete personification of what was originally a classic ""evil monster."" Also, the scene where Grendel >!takes the hero that wants to be killed by him out of his cave and slaughters a bunch of the other guards!< is actually hilarious. 
5. *Bambi* by Felix Salten: The Disney movie does this story no justice. Literally made me weep at the end, not out of sadness but out of pure appreciation for the quality of the story. A beautiful personification of woodland creatures and a beautifully solemn take on the ways that they interact with each other compared to traditional human interaction; biggest example of this is Bambi's relationship with his parents. Also, I'd like to acknowledge the fact that at one point, instead of just saying ""it is Autumn,"" Salten writes a whole chapter about two leaves on a tree who are discussing their fates as they watch their other leaf friends fall off the tree. So creative it hurts.
6. *Watership Down* by Richard Adams: Very similar to Bambi. One additional thing that *Bambi* does too that I'd like to point out is the way that the behavior of the personified animals relates to real-world human observation. I can't even describe how much talent it takes to be able to completely personify common wildlife while retaining the idea that this could all be going on in the real world and humans just aren't seeing it. And, with that really cool dynamic also comes rabbit trickery and religion and wars which is just so so cool and fantastical. 
7. *Johnathan Strange & Mr. Norrell* by Susanna Clarke: Literally could have been the next LOTR or Harry Potter if Clarke hadn't gone a little bit insane after publishing it. The worldbuilding is just so potent and so much history is mentioned that wasn't elaborated on. Magicians and fairies seamlessly alloyed with our own real history, castles and curses and wishes and spells and knights and wars and... you get the idea. Comedy, tragedy, philosophy, heroism, villainism, this book has it all. And, trying to stay with my original purpose, the characters aren't clichés. They have very well-developed moral and social complexes as well as relationships with the history of the world that make you feel like this could easily be nonfiction. 

Honorable mentions:   
*The Hobbit* by J.R.R. Tolkien  
*The Pandora Sequence* series by Frank Herbert  
*Sirens of Titan* by Kurt Vonnegut  
*Piranesi* by Susanna Clarke  
*John Carter in A Princess of Mars* by Edgar Rice Burroughs  
*The Wizard of Venus* by Edgar Rice Burroughs

After writing this I realized I'm basically just writing a list of my favorite books, but it gave me the opportunity to explore my own personal feelings as to why I find so much more joy in exploring philosophies and morals and ideas through the lens of fantasy and sci-fi rather than reading a book purely about those topics. I think it's probably because I get bored, but I also find merit in the idea that authors devising those ideas in a fictional space allows me more leeway in choosing to apply those complex themes and ideas to my own life, and that lack of pressure to apply them in real life actually results in a more open mind and ultimately more lessons learned and ideas explored. 

Thanks for reading however much you read of this and please let me know of any other books that you think fit this category!! <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rrpihk/my_booklist_of_the_sober_fantasy_genre_that_ive/,2021-12-30T02:05:34Z,11,17,books,Narnia,POST,Fantasy
182ztz,"My friend's neighbor in the apartment she lives in accidentally burned down the shed in the backyard, destroying stored personal memories and a large collection of books. I think you guys can help me.","Logged on Facebook to see this: http://i.imgur.com/1QoMbd2.png


The person who lost her shed is a close friend of mine. In the summer of 2009, I became homeless. I was nineteen, living out of my van, begging for food. I slept in my van outside of my school so that I could finish summer classes required for me to graduate. Not only did this person allow me to stay with her, but I only paid $60 a month and had free reign of the kitchen, living room, etc. I am not the first person she has helped, despite the fact that she can barely afford her rent, bills, and food. In the last year, her bike (only mode of transportation) was stolen, motor bike broken down, temporary room mate stolen her entire rent payment and made off, and two break-ins, but refuses the charity of people.


As a hobby, she likes catching wild cats and nurturing them back to health, and then finds them decent homes when they are considered safe pets. 


Reddit, I really, REALLY want to do something for this woman. Without her kindness, I am honestly unsure of where I would be right now. She deserves a lot better than what has happened to her. I am making an effort to recover the books she lost in the fire. I am not asking for money, but if you have any used books you no longer feel attached to, I would be deeply honored to deliver them to her.


I asked her what she is missing and she only replied:

""Fear Nothing"" by Dean Koontz

a little collection of short stories by Stephen King 

some Doonesbury and other comic books

every single harry potter I personally owned

Chronicles of Narnia (all of them)

Crispin and the Cross of Lead

a couple Chuck Palahniuk books ed:

 Bruce Campbell's autobiography If Chins Could Kill...

and a ton more, but I can't think of them all


Also, just to be clear, the books weren't in storage in the shed. Her mom and her had turned the shed into a hang-out. Her daughter would sit in the shed and read books.

5ctcbg,Lev Grossman's The Magicians (Opinions),"Hi Reddit! 

A few years ago, when I was still in college I picked up The Magicians and loathed it. It seemed to me, at the time, a blatant Narnia/Harry Potter rip off. 

Lately, after watching the trailers for the new season of the series in SyFy, I've found myself intrigued about the books and whether or not my reaction to them is any different to last time's. 

For those of you who have read the series. What did you think of them? Did you like them? Did you hate them? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5ctcbg/lev_grossmans_the_magicians_opinions/,2016-11-14T01:24:08Z,23,7,books,Narnia,POST,Fantasy
1bt6bz,Looking for books where the protagonist discovers the world at the same time as you.,"I prefer mostly fantasy and sci-fi novels, and I love to be immersed in the world I'm reading about. I have found a common theme in the books I enjoy most are when the main character(s) are as new to their world as I am. If they're just learning everything about the world for the first time, and I'm learning along with them, I find myself relating and immersed all the more.

Some examples of books I have enjoyed with this theme:

* Wheel of Time series - Robert Jordan 
* Sword of Truth series - Terry Goodkind

The main characters start from small beginnings, and really don't know much about the wide world until they set out.

* Neverwhere / American Gods / Anansi Brothers - Neil Gaiman

There's a great deal more to the world than we know, and the main characters, despite being thrust into the thick of it, learn about it as we move through the new world.

* Magic Kingdom for Sale--Sold! - Terry Brooks

The main character literally finds himself in a world as new to him as it is to us. Adventure ensues.

* The Magic of Recluse - L.E. Modesitt Jr.

The hero sets out only knowing his own small corner of the world, and we discover the world through his travels.

Thanks for any suggestions!

Edit: Thanks for all the ideas, everything looks like it will be right up my alley. I'm headed for the book store tomorrow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1bt6bz/looking_for_books_where_the_protagonist_discovers/,2013-04-06T19:17:44Z,30,13,books,Narnia,POST,Fantasy
98l6pt,[Rant] Renumbering the Narnian Chronicles (or any other series for that matter),"The Narnian Chronicles are one of my favorite series.  I've had a boxed set since I was about 10 and I've read them all over a dozen times.  I've read them in published order, and I've read them in Narnian chronological order, and the canonical order of them to me has always been the order in which they were written and published.

As such, I find it more than a little irritating that some recent publishers have taken it upon themselves to renumber the books using the Narnian chronological order.  While I realize that this may make the series seem more like one long story, the tales actually read better in the order they were written.  As an example, the story of _The Horse and His Boy_ is sung to the Narnians at the beginning of _The Silver Chair_.  This, along with subtler things like how the origins of the White Witch are more enjoyable when you've had four books between _The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe_ and _The Magician's Nephew_.

This is true for other series as well.  I originally read the Deryni novels in chronological order (starting with _Camber of Culdi_) rather than in published order, and I felt like I had somehow missed the way that world developed in the author's mind.  It's hard to explain without going over the books and taking detailed notes, but it's as though there are things assumed or revealed in the wrong order.  There may have been outright spoilers, though it's been too long for me to remember specifics.

Anyone else feel like books are best read in published order, rather than re-ordered into the in-universe chronological order?  I think the Tom Clancy novels would suffer from this as well.  Reading _Without Remorse_ before others like _Clear and Present Danger_ would mess up the character of John Clark.

This all got started, by the way, when my daughter brought home _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_ from the library and it was listed as Book 5.

What information might someone not get from a cursory read?

I've been reading a lot of classics over the last few months, trying to fill in the blank patches from school. The big difference between reading solo and reading in a classroom is the ""guided tour"" effect, where any subtext is carted out and presented so that you don't miss anything on your first trip through. That got me wondering about what sorts of things I'm missing, reading in this way.

qj2fg5,Should I read or dump The Royal Ranger sequel series?,"I’m just about finished *The Lost Stories*, which are providing a beautiful conclusion the original series overall. Soon I will have to decide to read or avoid *The Royal Ranger* sequel series. I’ve heard both good things and really bad things about it, and I would like some advice based on my thoughts of what I know about it.

Here’s what I do know and my thoughts on it:

>!**Alyss dies a ridiculously absurd death right at the beginning in order to get the new story going.** To be honest, I was never very fond of Alyss until around the end of the original series, so I won’t be too upset to see her die an undeserving death aside from knowing how upset Will will be. Heck, if I could skip it without missing any crucial details about the future plot, I might just do that. It’s clear that everyone hated that event due from coming out of nowhere and seeming unnecessary.!<

>!**Will drops his heroic nature and slaughters a bunch of people in rage.** This is a huge red flag for me. A major part of what makes me love Will so much is that no matter how rough things get for him, his heart is always in the right place. If he suddenly takes a turn and becomes a less moral character, I don’t know if I want to see him do that after how well things were left off in *Lost Stories*.!<

>!**Will trains an apprentice of his own, and it’s none other than freakin CASSANDRA’S DAUGHTER!!** This is like a dream come true for me. My biggest letdown from the original series is that Will never trained an apprentice of his own, which would stay true to the title *Ranger’s Apprentice*, but instead spent the second half of the series just going to new places and stopping new villains. No overarching story anymore. On top of that, Cassandra was by far my favorite character from the original series aside from Will, and each book that had her almost always felt way better way than the books without her. To have her and Horace’s daughter as the new protagonist and as Will’s apprentice would be the coolest thing ever, assuming her character is written well and she takes after her mother.!<

>!**All original series characters except for Will are not going to be very involved with the plot, if at all.** I’m totally fine with that. I’m satisfied with how much I’ve seen from Halt and Horace. Will and Cassandra are the only characters I want to see more of, and if Cassandra’s daughter is like her then I’ll be happy.!<

That’s pretty much all I know and how I feel about it. Judging by these thoughts, do you think I’d enjoy *The Royal Ranger* sequel series more than I would hate it? Also I have a few other questions.

Is there an overarching story between all the books, or are there several new stories throughout the books like in the original series?

How good is the character development? I value that a lot in books.

Are the villains more fleshed out than they were in the original series? I’m getting tired of reading about villains who basically come out of nowhere and are just evil without much reason or backstory.

Do we get to see more Ranger skills at play? I feel like there wasn’t enough of Rangers being awesome with their skills and planning.

Pre(r)amble

Alright Book 2 of The Royal Rangers series. Or I suppose I should just call it book 13. 

No Will or Halt! Which is kinda disappointing for me. But if you are a Gilan fan you are pretty happy to see Gilan again. I'm actually glad Flanagan decided to use Gilan as a character more in these later books.  I mean he does get to use a sword which is nice.

The story is pretty good. This is actually kinda the first story that actually ends on a TBC where the story actually isn't resolved at all.  Not so mad about that now but when it first came out and I had to wait a year for the next one that was annoying especially since I was reading it as a YA so my interest in the series was quickly gone without more content. Probably the only reason why I remember the series is because it takes up a while shelf on my bookcase and the subreddit which I was surprised to actually exist. Anyways enough  rambling let me tell you what you need to know.


The Kills 

The army makes their return to the count. And with that the inability to count because everything is focused on the main characters and Flanagan doesn't always (but sometimes does) go over the aftermath of battles. Here's what I can say tho the army gets a confirmed number of 12. But that could be maybe 10 higher. As they are fighting mercenaries who don't exactly have the greatest morale they retreat before many of them actually die.  

Gilan gets a confirmed 5. With potentially 6 or 7 and he could've gotten 1 more kill but at a point in the story he kinda randomly decides to shoot to injure and not kill. 

Horace just 1. But good to see him on the count. 

Maikeru adds 2 kills to the other category.

Everyone's favourite princess gets a kill. 

That's Right! Cassandra finally gets a kill in this series! Wait did you think everyone's favourite princess is Madelyn? No she doesn't really do much. And is really just a pretty bad Ranger especially considering she is in 4th year.  She falls asleep, forgets to stay still, doesn't keep directions (not entirely her fault) she doesn't tell bumper to like go x distance past the line and then like listen for a call to go towards Maddie. That way she wouldn't have to walk all the way back to castle Araulen. I mean she would still probably end up being late but she might've been able to just best Dimon and raise the drawbridge just in time. Speaking of things that should've been done. I honestly don't understand why Horace and Gilan didn't decide to just hold to ford as they could easily do that. Like I kinda understand wanting to find those original 6 guys who led you to the ambush as they might join another group and you might not want to be pincered at the Ford. But I still don't then understand Gilan leaving the Ford so soon. Like honestly He should've stayed there longer with his archers. Like they outnumber you 3 to 1 and you aren't going to stay as long as possible to even the numbers even more. 

Anyways that's all. Have a Good Day see you guys probably next Wednesday. Maybe sooner it is Easter so I will have a bit more time to read. But that's also more time for other things so who knows",https://www.reddit.com/r/RangersApprentice/comments/12abdkk/royal_ranger_kill_count_the_red_fox_clan/,2023-04-03T06:09:21Z,2,19,rangersapprentice,The Royal Ranger,POST,Fantasy
17qiqpy,Would The Royal Ranger's ending have been better if Jory Ruhl had gotten away?,"I really enjoyed The Royal Ranger. However, one thing that bothered me was how neatly everything got tied up regarding Will's quest for vengeance. He nearly gets expelled from the Rangers because of his single minded obsession with catching Jory Ruhl but then, he just gets handed his wife's murderer on a silver platter and he even gets an ironic, fiery death.

I think it would have been much better if Will had a ""friend or idol"" moment at the end where he has the choice to kill Ruhl but doing so would leave Maddie in danger and that he saves her while Ruhl gets away.

The ending we had, while satisfying, was just a little too neat. It also didn't allow for any growth on Will's part.

rs42y7,What is the *goal* of the Era 2-Royal Ranger series?,"For context:  Big fan of the original RA series, I am re-reading (or listening on audiobook) right now.

I have listened to the first 3 Royal Ranger books, and - as others have posted about - I find them underwhelming.  I find the series slow and boring, to be blunt.  (I thought the first book was \~okay, but the Red Fox Clan stuff?  Super slow and boring....).  

Is the story and pacing designed to pull a new audience?  The original series seems to have universal appeal, so I don't understand the move.  The issue is not - in my mind - centered around having a young-woman as the protagonist, there are plenty of lead female characters in books that don't have the issues I am talking about (e.g., the Era 1 Mistborn trilogy).   It's the story and such as a whole. 

Or:  Maybe Flanagan is trying too hard to make Maddie into something that doesn't fit with what he created before....so coincidentally, her role as a lead \*is\* the issue?   

Just very disappointing so far, that's all.

Overview:

 

Ranger Will and his apprentice Maddie are back in an adventure that takes them across the sea to a land where no one can be trusted - not even the King.

King Philippe of Gallica appeals to King Duncan for help. His son is being held hostage by a baron who is making demands. The Gallican King wants Duncan to send a Ranger to rescue the boy.

Will and Maddie would be an ideal choice for the mission. They can pretend to be father and daughter to dispel suspicions, with Will posing as a jongleur and Maddie as a knife thrower. They'll travel to Chateau des Falaises and see if the rebel baron will demand they perform for him. If he doesn't, they’ll break in some other way.

But travelling through Gallica proves to have its own risks – armed bandits, treacherous royals, and even a mysterious follower.

gqou7q,SPOILERS I really don't like The Royal Ranger book one.,"I don't like it because I don't like the plot. To have one of the main charachters die in the start of the book, to Maddie trying to ""replace"" her, I just don't enjoy it.
 It just feels like a reskinned Ruins of Gorlan DLC if you get what I mean. Sevral main points:

1. I felt like Alyss dying had no purpose onther than to bring Maddie into the plot. It felt very upsetting and pointless. I never felt any sort of justice or finality to her death. It felt very open and sudden. I don't believe it did anything other than turn Will into a new Halt. I don't enjoy the book anymore.

2. Maddie. Maddie, Maddie, Maddie. I HATE her as a charachter. Her WHOLE purpose was to provide a replacement for Alyss, which I felt she even failed at that. I felt like her whole becoming a ranger thing was almost exactly the same as Will's. I don't like her replacing Alyss, because Will and Alyss's love was one of the things that I loved about the Original Series. I felt like she had a sort of privelege from the Corps, even though it is plot. I feel like her charachter was bad.

3. Other things. I felt NO NEED for Crowley to die, and it didn't help the plot for me anyway. I don't find Will to be like he was portrayed in the last series. I felt upset that this book even exists. That was main point anyways.

i98qvw,Are you excited for the next Royal Ranger book?,"Hey guys, with the next Royal Ranger book releasing later this year(November 3, 2020) I was curious to know your thoughts on it. Personally, I've been a bit bummed with his latest books, they haven't been as good as the original Ranger's Apprentice. However, this one seems more interesting. It's going to cover international travel, something I always liked in RA books. Seeing the different lands was always exciting. In addition, the villain seems like he may be a serious legit villain for once. So far, Maddie has only faced kinda weak villains, but this guy sounds like a challenge at least. Similar to Morgarath.

rbsftp,Nearing the end of the main series. Having trouble deciding if I should commit myself to The Royal Ranger or end it on a definite high note.,"I have read all 10 main books and I am making my way through *Lost Stories*, which has been praised for how well it wraps up the story.

(Update: finished Lost Stories)

And soon I will have to decide if I want to continue with the books, with this spinoff series The Royal Ranger. I have heard very mixed reviews from it. For one thing, a lot of previous good characters of the series die needlessly just to get the plot going, and Will loses his heroic nature and becomes more roguish. However I have also heard that he trains an apprentice of his own, which is something I’ve been hoping for in the main series but didn’t get. But most of all, the apprentice is Cassandra‘s daughter. Cassandra was probably the character I enjoyed the most in the main series, and the books always felt better if she was in them. So having her daughter as Will’s apprentice would be like a dream come true.

So my deciding factor is this: is it executed well or done poorly? Is The Royal Ranger series actually a good story worth reading, or is it just meant to serve as a money cow using nostalgia and familiar characters to draw in previous readers? At first I wasn’t willing to give up Will’s heroic nature for the sake of more Ranger’s Apprentice books and I was content to stop the series once I finished *Lost Stories*. But if this new spin on the series is worth getting into, if it has sufficient plot, character development, and sequences, then I will be willing to read it as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RangersApprentice/comments/rbsftp/nearing_the_end_of_the_main_series_having_trouble/,2021-12-08T14:23:43Z,11,25,rangersapprentice,The Royal Ranger,POST,Fantasy

64npmk,"So it's been a while since I read any of the RA books, but I've just finished Royal Ranger!","Back in middle school I first found the Ranger's Apprentice series and have been reading them ever since. Of course I jumped onto the Brotherband Chronicles as well. For Christmas this past year I got the two most recent BC books and finished the second of those last week. At the back it listed the Royal Ranger and I was confused, I didn't think I had that one. 

I looked it up and based on the first two sentences of the synopsis I knew I had not read that book. I guess I thought the Lost Stories was the last book of the series and it never occurred to me to check. 

So I went to the store and bought Royal Ranger and the Tournament at Gorlan. I spent a ton oft time the last few days in bed reading Royal Ranger and just now finished it. It was wonderful and wrapped up that series very well, I think.

x2qkdp,My problem with the series,"When I first learned about how many books were in the series, I was dying with excitement to read the books. So I read the 11 books in the main series, both of the early years books and the first entry in the Royal Rangers series (still haven’t read Brotherband or the Royal Ranger, I will get to that eventually). 

Then I realized a critical problem: you know those TV shows that were alright in the beginning, and then hit their peak after a few seasons, and then just enter a steep decline. Those shows then usually keep going for decades, churning out mediocre garbage. Although I haven’t read the Royal Ranger series and Brotherband, I still feel like Rangers Apprentice is slowly becoming one of those TV shows.

I think Flanagan knows that he has a big enough fan base that they’ll buy his books no matter how bad (relatively speaking) they are, so he is totally fine with prioritizing quantity over quality. This is the difference between a good writer and an amazing writer, and amazing writer will never sacrifice quality to have more quantity.

This is going on purely what others say about the newer entries, but I think most people are getting tired of the Royal Rangers series, it just doesn’t feel like the same books that made us first fall in love with the series. The character Maddie is god awful and should never be a main character in any book, repetitive plot lines that are boring as heck, killing off essential characters for some reason (you all know what character I’m talking about) etc. etc. etc. They just don’t capture the same magic that the original 11 books did.

So how can Flanagan fix this (assuming he wants to). Here are a few suggestions:

- **Stop expanding the Royal Ranger series**, or at least make a couple of really good books to end the series. Who asked for Maddie to be the main character and basically just killing off all the good characters? We only wanted a few good books that explain Will’s mentorship, that’s all we asked for.

- **Make more Early years books.** Maybe explore Halt’s youth and apprenticeship in detail. Maybe go into Gilan’s apprenticeship. Maybe throw in a few stories of Crowley, Baron Arald, King Duncan etc.

- **Make another compilation of short stories like The Lost Stories.** Pretty self explanatory.

- **Focus more on characters, rather than the plot.** This has always been Flanagan’s weak spot. He has made really good plots before, but his characters are always sorely lacking. They are always pretty basic and lack nuance. Even the main characters n’t even that fleshed out.

**But what are your suggestions?**

TL:DR This series is decining in quality, what can the author do to fix the issue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RangersApprentice/comments/x2qkdp/my_problem_with_the_series/,2022-08-31T22:25:23Z,8,35,rangersapprentice,The Royal Ranger,POST,Fantasy

12yubnm,Who else is tired of Flanagan pumping out mediocre books in the last few years and want one last sendoff to the series?,"Don’t get me wrong, I will always be a fan of the series, and I don’t hate the newer books, but I think it’s sad to see one of my favorite book series of all time turn into what it is today. The reality is, the last few books in the “Royal Ranger” series have had pretty boring plotlines, one-dimensional characters (*cough cough* Maddie) and a host of other problems.

Now, I understand that he’s getting to that age where retirement is probably looming, maybe his brain isn’t as good as it once was at coming up with new ideas, maybe he wants to provide his family with a little bit of extra money while he’s retired, maybe he’s stuck to a contract? Whatever underlying factors there are behind the decline in quality, I understand and respect his decision to keep going. 

That said, it’s sad to see “Ranger’s apprentice” decline into what it is now, so here are some of my ideas for what he could do as a sort of “magnum opus” if you will:

> Doing a third “Early years” book. Maybe he could talk about Gilan’s apprentice years, or maybe even Halt’s apprentice years with Prichard.

> Doing a second collection of short mini stories, similar to “the lost stories”.

> Doing another book where most of the main characters all help each other to accomplish a goal, similar to “The oakleaf bearers / the battle for Skandia”, “Erak’s Ransom” and “the emperor of Nihon-Ja”.

ukznlk,The newest books have been appalling,"TL;DR: Royal Ranger should have ended on book 3 and brotherband should have ended on book 8

I think John Flanagan should stop. He's getting old and deserves a break. The quality of the books has gone down - RR books 4 and 5 have been pretty boring and were like 250 pages each. What's worse is book 9 of Brotherband - it's 280 pages but tells the story of what could be in its own 3 book saga like the outcasts, invaders and hunters. The worst bit? All of those books are about 500 pages long. 

I'd much rather have the series end on a high than have it continue with reduced quality. Not worth it.

To be honest, the mentioned books have been abysmal. The royal Ranger 4 and 5 were bad compared to 2 and 3, which are widely regarded as average in the community. I was really excited for brotherband 9 - the whole concept of it is amazing. It's similar to the outcasts in that it's finding something that's been lost, which is ok. However, there was no major battle, no major hunting down thing, >!they literally found the thing that they were hunting in the middle of the book!<.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RangersApprentice/comments/ukznlk/the_newest_books_have_been_appalling/,2022-05-08T11:22:21Z,15,14,rangersapprentice,The Royal Ranger,POST,Fantasy

11kew8l,My Opinions of the Main Characters in Ranger’s Apprentice.,"-Will: The Main Character. I think his development is pretty good, and he is very relatable. I’ve always had a special place in my heart for Will as a character. Quite Solid. My only issue with him is that they made him into a Halt clone of sorts in RR book 1.

Halt: Perfection. easily the best and most fleshed-out character in the series in my opinion. Couldn’t have been written better.

-Horus. He had amazing character development in the ruins of gorlan and remained practically stagnant for the rest of the series. A good character nonetheless, albeit overpowered. It didn’t seem like he had any trouble with dispatching enemies other than Morgarath and the giant in kings of Clonmel. Even so, Morgarath, who was set up to be the big bad of the series, is taken down by Horus, who wasn’t even fully trained when he challenged Morgarath to single combat. The giant from Clonmel was also beaten by Horus even while he was under the influence of poison. Ridiculously overpowered, but a good morally straight character.

-Gilan: Super solid side-turned-main character. Excellent development and backstory. I always liked how he was able to use a sword as well.

-Alyss. Now, this is a controversial topic. I liked her at first, but I felt like she got duller and duller with each new entry. She was an interesting character initially. A tall, blonde, and intelligent young lady who was destined to be a courier and had lots of room for character development and growth. But none of that happened. At least on a large scale. However, it seems like all of her purposes were whittled away other than being a love interest for Will by the time book 5 rolled around. And you may disagree, but how deep of a character is she? I saw this on another post, but the OP pointed out that she doesn’t have a whole lot to her. For example, name a topic, and you can already know what Halt’s opinion on it will be. With Alyss, I wouldn’t be sure. She doesn’t seem to have much of an opinion on anything. She’s not nearly as fleshed out as Halt, Will, Horus, Cassandra, or even Gilan. I’d even argue Jenny is more characterized in some aspects. And with what is in my opinion, not enough relationship development, Will and Alyss get married. (I’d honestly say Horus and Cassandra could’ve used more time to develop their relationship, but alas, it is set in medieval times and it is a children’s book at heart.) And then right after their marriage, Alyss is killed offscreen for the sake of Will having more character development and to introduce Maddie and continue the series. And following her death, she is completely forgotten by all except will by the end of RR Book 1. And as far as I know, she isn’t ever mentioned again after the Royal Ranger. While I completely disagree with killing her offscreen, I think Flanagan felt more comfortable killing her off than any of the other main characters as she was the blandest and weakest character in comparison to the other main characters. (In my opinion)

Cassandra: One of the best characters in the series. Great development. She knows what she wants and is headstrong in all that she does. I only wish we got to see her more in the books.

-George is completely underused as a character. As far as I know, we see him in the first and tenth books of the original series as well as the sixth book of Royal Ranger. Besides that, he is mentioned a couple of times. I feel like John Flanagan shouldn’t have even bothered naming him as a character in the ward, as he wasn’t going to be used much. However, I suppose he was not intended as a main character.  so this is not a very big deal.

-Morgarath: Underutilized. He was defeated far too early in the series. I think he should have been developed and used more as a villain.

Lady Pauline: An excellent character! If Alyss was half as awesome as Lady Pauline, should have been so much better! You can’t go wrong here.

Crowley: Exactly what he needs to be. Full of personality and interesting. Great character.

King Duncan: Duncan is surprisingly quite relatable at times even as a king. He’s a good character with a good heart.

Baron Alrald: He’s like the Hagrid of the series! Big and strong, but also kind and lovable.

Maddie: Honestly, this is a tough one. At times she feels like a cheap clone of Cassandra that’s even more stubborn and headstrong. I don’t see any Horace in her. She’s snappy and spoiled at first, but she gets better with time. Even after six books, I’m still not sure how I feel about her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RangersApprentice/comments/11kew8l/my_opinions_of_the_main_characters_in_rangers/,2023-03-06T21:37:45Z,11,30,rangersapprentice,The Royal Ranger,POST,Fantasy

br1kqx,"I gotta say, I never get old of The Ruins of Gorlan (Specifically the part with the Kalkara)","So I'm re-reading the series for the millionth time and I always get such chills during the parts with the Kalkara. Every night in the plains when it's just the Halt, Will, and Gilan on the hunt for these supernatural beasts, it always freaks me out, and I love it. The way they are described earlier as these hulking bear like creatures who can paralyze you with just a look is terrifying and, while I know that nothing happens untill they get to the ruins, I am always scared of one of the Kalkara jumping out of nowhere and attacking while Will is on watch or something. It really amazes me how the book always manages to terrify me every time I read. The best part is when Will comes to the realization that the Halt isn't hunting the Kalkara, the Kalkara are hunting him. I can't imagine how Halt must have felt I'm that moment when he sees the tracks of the Kalkara diverging into the forests around him. Such terror knowing it's just him and at he has no way of knowing when they will attack.

Ok, just wanted to share how much I love this part in Ruins. John Flanagan has done such amazing work with the Rangers apprentice series, and while I know the books have taken more of a realistic approach to the world since the days of Kalkara and Wargals, which doesnt make me love the other books in the series any less by the way, but I really hope we get to see some supernatural elements in the Royal Ranger series. Either way, I'm sure I will love it. 

And if anyone wants to nerd out about any other part of the series, please do so, I would love to discuss anything Ranger's Apprentice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RangersApprentice/comments/br1kqx/i_gotta_say_i_never_get_old_of_the_ruins_of/,2019-05-20T21:24:41Z,7,44,rangersapprentice,The Royal Ranger,POST,Fantasy
okgpnv,The Red Fox Clan (Spoilers possible),"I'm on chapter 12 and at the part where Maddie visits King Duncan and it mentions him twinging at the pain in his leg. 

First the meer fact he's still alive puzzles me. In book 12 or book 1 of the Royal Ranger series it states he had already been bed ridden for months because of it. He's older and shows no signs of improving. He was sick enough he couldn't hold Halts wrist let alone anything else for long. He also states, ""Let's not fool ourselves, Halt. I don't have long."" 

Fast forward to Red Fox Clan (a fair bit of time) 3 years later.

Maddie is entering her 4th year and so that's a minimum of 3 years, since the months is arbitrary time frame in book 12, since he first got the leg injury. With that in mind it doesn't make sense he hasn't recovered or died from the injury given the severity from which it was initially described and the fact that in this world, medicine isn't all that great. Even for a King. Did anybody else think about this? Or is there a piece of detail I've missed or don't remember? 

I also find the aging of the characters funny but we can discuss that separately if whoever reads this likes. 

(Caveat) The books are set for ages 10-14 and I'm 23. So I'm not just going to stop reading them lol. I've read this series since Ruins of Gorlan released in the U.S. in 2005. I still have some of the first copies.

gffnzm,Possible inconsistency between Return of the Temujai/Red Fox Clan?,"I recently read the 8th(?) book in the Brotherband series (Return of the Temujai) in which Hal and the gang capture the Sha'shan (which is mentioned in the Red Fox Clan (RR book 2)) and at the end the Heron is irreparable broken. But I am re-reading the Royal Ranger series, and in the Red Fox Clan, which takes place some years after (as Hal mentions) they are still on the Heron and Hal says that it's about time for him to build a new one. 

So

Either it's a new ship (Hal said he was going to name his new ship the heron as well at the end of BB #8) but then i'm not sure if it makes sense that it's already worn out? The time span here seems to be no more than a few years (Less than 10?) 

Or Mr. Flanagan missed this and its just an inconsistency, and he assumed the original heron is still intact? This seems unlikely. 

I'm just a little confused about the timeline and the Heron and how it all lines up and it was bugging me a bit. If you can make sense of any of it, please tell me about how I am wrong in the comments.

iistt2,I just finished The Ruins of Gorlan. IT WAS AWESOME.,"I hope it's not too late to fanboy over this YA series. I spent this entire week coding websites and I needed a short audiobook to keep me through the work: The Ruins of Gorlan was JUST what I needed.

This book is so much FUN. The characters are all so charming and likeable. Will, Halt, Horace, George, Bob, and Gillan are all fantastic characters and I had so much fun spending time with them! 

I especially love the friendship between Walt and Horace. The ending where >!Horace cheered the loudest during the Baron's honoring of Will!< made me smile so hard my cheeks hurt.

I seriously want to be a Ranger. I want a Ranger horse, a Ranger bow and arrow, I want to go on boar hunts and Ranger gatherings, I want to learn how to be invisible in a Ranger cloak. 

And while >!I certainly loved the scene between Alyss and Will, and I hope to see their romance develop!<, I liked how the main focus of the book was on adventure and friendship. There was almost no romance, which a lot of YA books tend to focus too much on.

I was only supposed to listen to the first book like I did with Redwall, but now I want to listen to EVERYTHING. I just love these characters so much and I want to spend more time with them, but I gotta be honest, committing to 12 books is kinda daunting. Is it fun until the very end, or do some books lag in pace?

Anyway, The Ruins of Gorlan is a terrific book, and while I think I'm a bit too late to the party, I'm still especially glad I got to read it. Or listen to it, and speaking of which, the narrator was terrific in this one. I hope he continues being the narrator for the rest of the series.

I wish I had read these books when I was 12, I get the feeling I would've had so much fun with them. I was supposed to listen to Lies of Locke Lamora right after, but now I kinda wanna continue on with the second book. I really should make a decision soon - I do not like that empty feeling you get when you finish a good book and have to return to the real boring world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RangersApprentice/comments/iistt2/i_just_finished_the_ruins_of_gorlan_it_was_awesome/,2020-08-29T13:59:34Z,41,123,rangersapprentice,The Royal Ranger,POST,Fantasy

9m4l4z,Theory about the ending of the Red Fox Clan (massive [spoiler] ),"So, I read the book yesterday, and was kind of annoyed that it ended in such a cliffhanger. Maddie and Evanlyn trapped in the tower, Gilan and Arnaut (oh no wait shit he’s called Horace or something) are trapped in the fort. There are some characters who are not trapped though.

THE BROTHERBAND!

I have a feeling this storyline won’t be continued in Book 14, but rather in Book 8 of Brotherband, something that has never been done before! (At least not that I know about it)

I have a feeling this would be very cool, changing the perspective that way. And an all-Araluen based Heron adventure is pretty cool.

afgxm2,Some of the criticism on RA I started to build up over the years. (Potential Spoilers),"Hi all, this is my list.

It definitely feels like Book 4 was meant to be the last book originally of the series but got cut and changed to be part of a bigger franchise due to the popularity the RA series was gaining. Hence I feel like, what oh what have we not been able to read yet because of that?

The Early Years book suffer some of the lack of character Interaction and especially 'Thrill' and 'Danger' to the story. It felt more like a report on what happened in those stories, then a actual book on it's own in it's own right, primairly due to me feeling like they didn't add any memorable characters or plot twists, Interesting events and other elements to it. Brotherband also suffered from it, but not as much and definitely not in every book.

And lastly but by far what somewhat broke Ranger Apperentice for me, the death of Alyss. 
I was all hyped for the Intial release of the work title: 'Duel at Araluen.' till it got changed to 'Royal Ranger.' And even then I was all pumped to read it.
But to say that my heart and mind broke apart when I read the backside of the hardcover would be a understatement, even now I fail to understand why to kill such a beloved yet underappreciated, and especially, barely shown character.

Why not just Halt? It should have given a similar effect on Will and make some sense too, as Halt is quite old after all. 
And now we are stuck with two things, the fact that this specific event made the entire franchise take a much more grim, dark and more 'realistic mature' stance, yet the book it self was following quite the same formula it always had, all be it a bit forced, if not rushed one that lacked some of it's original charm. So far I know RA is not a 'Realistic Mature' Roman or something, so why did it try to be one in that specific act?
That combination makes zero sense to me. Not only for the book but also to what kind of writer Flanagan is, at least from so far I know him as one.
And the other point is that Will has really taken a hit as a character due to the loss of Alyss and the only way we read any kind of real character development on him, is while great,but once again, due to a bit forced relation with Maddie.

And don't get me even started on how her death and the effect on WIll was written. Which makes this mess in my eyes even less sense making.

Let me know what you guys think of these points, I just felt like I had to get this off my mind for years by now ^^
I got plenty more but those are for another time.

I do hope however that the Movies/Series, whatever they will be will do anything but kill Alyss.

That's all for now folks.

ho1gj8,"Cowardly, dastardly dwarveses in The Hobbit","I've read The Hobbit and LOTR many times over the years, but recently for the first time as an actual ""adult"". While I still love it, I came to a surprising realisation. Thorins Party of dwarves are actually all cowardly, greedy, lazy bellends. Not least Thorin himself. I know the gold and arkenstone make him go a bit loopy, but even before that he's a knob.
Also, the dwarves are pretty useless. Getting caught by spiders, trolls, elves etc. They don't even slay the dragon to get their mountain back! That was just a bloke, who the dwarves then refused to compensate for the loss of his town.
I know this won't be ground breaking for most people, but it blew my teeny tiny mind a bit. Childhood Me remembers them as a band of heroic do-gooders 😁😁🙈

ddvf93,So... my boyfriend has never read The Hobbit,"And he’s leaving in a week for six months for work in a  pretty secluded place. 

Typically I show love by reading people the book... as it was read to me by the first person I fell in love with. So, as a gift to him I recorded myself reading it so he could listen to it while he’s away. Only took 10 hours, one minute, and 45 seconds. 

Please don’t rat me out if I’ve broken copywriter laws! It’s not for profit!!!

EDIT: thanks for the awards! I shall sit on my pile of gold and silver like Smaug on his - and relish it for evermore!!

Now, to those of you who have seemed to take such an offence that I read a book to him that I was read by an old boyfriend. Sorry you’re miffed. But that was 25 years ago and I’ve read the book (or parts of it at least) to lots of people - including my own kid. The ex’s parents used to read it to he and his brother, he read it to me, I’ve read it to others, I hope my son will read it to people. It’s a nice book to have read to you - it’s not a once in a lifetime opportunity. 

And, for the record, this guy knows how much the book has figured in my life, and that I’ve read it to others as it was read to me. And it wasn’t an issue. I, in fact, started reading it to him as he fell asleep one night and that’s when I thought I should record it so he could take it with him. My friends who know about the little project want a copy too. It’s a sweet gesture, not an original or sacred one.

EDIT TWO: many of you are asking how I recorded myself - I downloaded the app “Dictaphone” to my iPhone (but I’m sure android has a similar version). It was a pretty easy app to navigate and I’m pretty low tech). I recorded it chapter by chapter - some were ~10 mins, others ~50. Then I uploaded the files to my google drive and put them on a flash drive which I’ll give to him before he goes. And I’ll tell him about all this hoopla. He’ll think it’s funny - and in some cases, unwarranted. 

I’d recommend if you want to try something similar to do a dry run with each chapter of whatever book you’re reading - I think that would have made me goof less as it would have been fresher in my mind and in how the words flow. Granted that would at least double the time it takes to do any project. 

EDIT THREE: he really loved it. He thought it was the sweetest thing ever. And he thought people who had issue with it were dead wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ddvf93/so_my_boyfriend_has_never_read_the_hobbit/,2019-10-05T23:47:36Z,834,14112,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy
vhkqw7,The Hobbit,"One of Tolkien's greatest strokes of genius was to make his hero someone who was perfectly content never to have adventures.

It wasn't his only stroke of genius, of course. At the edges, you can feel something of the weight of history and darkness that would flower, in time, into The Lord of the Rings. Gollum, for instance; Gollum, in his wonderful strangeness, almost seems to belong to another book.

But The Hobbit isn't merely the prequel to LOTR. It's its own story, masterfully told.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vhkqw7/the_hobbit/,2022-06-21T19:00:34Z,180,1711,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

t5o4v2,The Hobbit is the first book I’ve read that has completely ruined the movies for me,"Just to preface, I was never a huge fan of The Hobbit trilogy but I really enjoyed the LotR trilogy. I always felt like three movies was too much for such a short book and it feels very much like nostalgia bait to Lord of the Rings.

After finally getting round to read The Hobbit, the movies sre completely ruined for me.

While the main plot of taking back Erebor is very similar, the story is modified and told in a very different way that doesn’t improve the movies over the books in any way.

Thorin feels extremely arrogant and is very contemn to other who aren’t him. In the books, he comes across as slightly arrogant but never that it’s blatant.

I thought Martin Freeman did a great job as Bilbo and his character was quite true to the books.

However, all of the LotR subplots and side characters are such waste of time and just bloat. Tauriel, Legolas, the barrel riding, the orcs and Azog, the Sauron sub plot, it all feels like massive nostalgis bait and takes away from some great elements of the books. 

An example of this is the dwarves getting caught by spiders. Instead of Bilbo doing his dancing and singing, taunting the spiders while invisible, this scene instead serves to bring in Legolas and Tauriel. 

There are so many elements of the books that could’ve made the movie 1000 times better and true to the source material, but it instead feels like Jackson wanted to make a LotR prequel and tie in as many LotR references as possible, rather than tell a story of The Hobbit that happens to take place in the same universe.

I’m going to start reading the LotR now and I’ve heard it doesn’t diverge quite as much from the books, and there’s at least plenty source material to justify that trilogy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/t5o4v2/the_hobbit_is_the_first_book_ive_read_that_has/,2022-03-03T09:55:14Z,1164,7299,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy
ryy5fj,The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien... what a masterpiece,"It's been actually quite a few months since I read this book, but back then I didn't have an app like Reddit and a wide community like r/books in which to share my thoughts about my reads. So I wanted to talk about The Hobbit, this amazing book written by Tolkien, who (if I remember correctly) is considered the ""founder"" of modern fantasy genre. And I love fantasy literature. Watch out for spoilers if you haven't finished it!

Before opening it, I expected it to be a difficult read, with complex writing and even more complex world building... but damn, I was wrong! After the first chapter, which was a really nice introduction and easy to comprehend, I fell in love with the book. The way it was written - humorous and fairy-tale like - absolutely charmed me. The world building was interesting and really amazing, it seemed detailed with a lot of love put into it. The story was very engaging, and all the adventures and troubles they experienced were amusing, I found myself swifting through the pages. Many moments put a smile on my face. I loved how Bilbo, after every adventure, became less of a ""lazy and monotonous"" guy and growed to be a brave and wise hobbit. I remember that I was so hyped when I reached the chapters where the crew arrived to the Lonely Mountain, where the evil and gold-obsessed dragon Smaug was keeping the dwarves' treasure to himself. I found myself attached to most characters and I even feared for their lives at times, especially Bilbo. I liked that a part of the book was happening without Gandalf's presence to protect the crew. He's always been protecting and assuring their security, it was interesting to see how Bilbo and the dwarves would handle their own situation by themselves, without a magician backing them up. Toward the end, the story took an amazing turn. Smaug flying off to destroy Lake Town, because of the dwarves' mistake. Bard getting allied with the Elves after the treasure was supposedly left with no guardian. Thorin regaining his inherited kingdom and treasure, but he turned out exactly like Smaug: twisted and selfish. All those misunderstandings and ""betrayals"" resulting into a bloody war... It was kinda sad to see Bilbo and Thorin's friendship getting ruined because of a mere treasure. And, even though I was mad at Thorin, I was really sad that he ended up dying. But at the very last moment, Bilbo reconciled with Thorin and he admitted his mistakes.

""If more of us valued food and cheer and song above above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world"".
The ending really marked me by its message, and the sadness yet happiness I felt when closing the book. It ended on a very serine note, wise and hopeful. Almost everyone learned from their mistakes, and tried to accept the other. It was a very good message. If we stopped fighting over possessions and decided to unite against a real issue, then maybe we'd be stronger and feel more like brothers. That's how I interpreted it.
I am happy I found this book, an endearing and memorable experience. I guess I'll be going with The Lord of the Rings next, because The Hobbit was a really good introduction to Tolkien's universe.

gpbcbx,Quarantine accomplishment: Finished The Hobbit + Lord of the Rings,"I’ve never been much of a reader, however, at the beginning of this year I made it my mission to always be reading a book at any time, so quarantine comes in handy lol. One of the best decisions I have ever made, and I feel like a fool for having missed out on so many great things for so long. 

Anyways, while I’ve seen the films I have never read the books so finally decided to tackle them and I am so happy I did it. Boy was it a ride. The Hobbit was probably my favourite of the four as for some reason I felt much more connected to Bilbo than to the other characters. I assume it’s because of the way the story is told in the LOTR is a bit different. 

One thing I did struggle with was envisioning the written words a picture, but having seen the movies helped a little to do so.

12x9l37,The Hobbit is so lovely,"Currently working my way through the hobbit for the very first time as an adult! I feel like I really missed out on this wonderful classic, and for some reason I just kept putting it off but I am so glad I chose to pick it up and try it out. I love Tolkien's use of language and Bilbo is just too cute to be true. I want to join the characters on their little adventure haha. I can picture their voices and appearances so vividly, and the setting as well (I have not watched the movie as I have trouble focusing on movies.)

My plan is actually to read the LOTR trilogy next! However, I am a bit worried that with my distractable brain/poor absorption of content, I will struggle to understand the LOTR. I would be really curious if anyone has any comments to offer on this? How did you find the reading experience of LOTR compared to the hobbit (no spoilers please!)

dio9z2,I finished reading The Hobbit and LOTR and I'm so proud of myself!,"I have never read any content close to the reading level of LOTR before, and even when I was reading a lot more (middle school/early high school), I never read any books as long as LOTR. So when I started this journey, I was a little skeptical of my ability to actually finish The Hobbit, let alone LOTR. But I made my way through The Hobbit with relative ease, and really just wanted to dive into LOTR next. So that's exactly what I did. I started LOTR in July and (thinking that I would be very slow or maybe even quit) gave myself a goal of finishing it by New Year's. Well, I finished two and a half months early! I kept my reading to about a chapter a day during workdays, reading during my lunch break. and I am so excited to have finished it that I'm now going to dive into the Silmarillion! I know this is going to be a challenging read, but I'm so proud of myself for getting this far that I just can't let myself stop!

None of my friends or family really understand my level of pride and excitement for just reading a couple of books, so I needed to brag on myself a little on the internet. Hope you guys don't mind too much.

1rs51e,Female characters do not exist in the Hobbit?,"I came across a differently phrased question on Quora, and a member called Ara Ogle provided a really good answer. I read the book and did not take notice of the lack of female characters so, this is interesting:

> It has always seemed to me that the lack of women in the Hobbit has something to do with Bilbo's character. While there are a few cases of author omsicience in the Hobbit, it is mostly viewed from Bilbo's point of view. It's worthy of note that the few times we do get even a tiny mention of women (Hobbit-girls, Bilbo's mother, and the sentence from Lake Twon quoted above) are all three instances of author omniscience rather than viewed from Bilbo. 

> And who is Bilbo? He is a lifelong bachelor. He's introverted; he seems to feel most comfortable in his own company or the company of very close friends. He's pretty shy. He doesn't like catching people's attention (he becomes the bearer of an invisible ring!) and when he has to talk to people he doesn't know, frequently stutters or appears uncomfortable. 

> Therefore, my theory is that we don't see women in The Hobbit because Bilbo doesn't see them. Bilbo doesn't see people as individuals until he gets to know them, but rather only as scary crowds that he prefers to stay far away from, and Bilbo actively avoids getting to know women, because he's afraid of them as an 'unknown'.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1rs51e/female_characters_do_not_exist_in_the_hobbit/,2013-11-30T17:16:40Z,874,1171,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

ydeu5t,"I just finished reading The Hobbit to my 6 year old daughter, and she loved it!","Some quick background - I've always been a Tolkien fan - read the main books, played the games, listened to the dramatizations and all that while I was growing up. Fast forward to now, Kiddos are around and my daughter absolutely loves to read. Proud parent sidenote, she's been reading by herself since 4, and is now at least at a 2nd grade level (she can read words like ""enthusiastic"" for example).

Anyway, I was at Sam's Club the other day and decided to buy The Hobbit since I've never actually owned a copy. I suggested reading it to her and she seemed interested enough, though I did tell her it wasn't really a kids book per se and she's welcome to stop listening if she got tired of it. 2 weeks later and we finished all 300 pages, with her laughing at Bilbo's goofiness, quoting random pieces of it through the day, and talking about it sometimes when she gets home from school. For me, it was an adventure as well. I don't read nearly as much as I did when I was younger, so it was pretty refreshing.

I did tell her about the Lord of the Rings book trilogy and mentioned how it might not be as interesting to her due to all the extra descriptions of armies, history, battle, and locations. But we'll see.

Now we're starting to watch the Hobbit movies made a few years back. I realize they don't stand up to the books so much, but in my opinion (I've watched them before), they're accurate enough except for some unnecessary added details, and it's great to be able to put faces to the names right?

It was one of the best experiences of my life.,"I've been waiting to read The Hobbit to my son since he was born but I had to wait until he was old enough to appreciate it. It was my first time reading it, also. He loves all things to do with knights, castles, and dragons so I knew it would be a big hit.

Over the course of two months, for roughly 30 minutes a night before bedtime, I acted out, as best as possible, the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and Company. I immensely enjoyed voice acting the various characters and could slip into Hobbit, Dwarf, Elf, Smaug, and, most enjoyably, Gollum at a whim. 

We finished last night and today I overheard my son singing the Misty Mountain song (I got several requests to repeat that part and I was able to sing it well thanks to YouTube). That experience brought us closer together and it warms my heart to know how much he appreciated our Hobbit time each night.

9bprt0,"First time reading The Hobbit, not what I was expecting and pleasantly surprised","A few years back after watching the excellent Lord of the Rings films I tried to get into the LOTR books to compare the films with the books, but I found the long descriptive writing hard to digest, especially compared to the action packed films, which caused me to drop the series midway through the first book and put me off trying to read anything Tolkien for awhile.

I'd only picked up The Hobbit after craving some fantasy and out of curiosity, and found that it couldn't be more different from LOTR. I found that where LOTR felt like I was slowly trekking along with the Fellowship, The Hobbit reads more action-packed, where at first Bilbo is meeting Gandalf and the dwarves, then Bilbo's trying to pickpocket trolls, then they're met with a big goblin army, then Bilbo's doing riddles and stealing a magic ring from Gollum in the dark, and the adventures continue.

I think I would've liked it a lot better if The Hobbit was adapted into a mini series instead of a movie trilogy, because the way it reads makes it feel like something you'd read a chapter a night to your kids.

The Hobbit was fantastic.  I really enjoyed the writing style as a storyteller that addresses the reader it really felt ... I don't know. I liked it.  I admit there were too many dwarves for me to really connect with any of them individually, but I enjoyed Bilbo's changes throughout.

itgacl,Started reading The Hobbit to my kids and discovered that they find it hilarious,"I finished reading the Harry Potter series to my boys (8 & 9), which incidentally took forever but they loved, and we decided to start with The Hobbit and then move on to Lord of the Rings. They are pretty avid readers and constantly beg for stories so I try to have something to read several nights a week. They found parts of HP quite funny, certainly more so than a lot of the other stuff we've read.

Anyway, I either don't remember reading the Hobbit at that age, or I first read it when I was a teenager, so I was shocked to discover that they find it genuinely funny. I know it's a children's book but I remembered it being an adventure story. Obviously there are exciting adventures and what not where they aren't laughing, but several times a chapter they are cracking up at people complaining about being hungry, tripping to avoid death, trying to stay asleep, tricking people, getting stuck in doors, etc. They particularly love the songs (they find the lyrics hilarious). Maybe they're just the right age to really appreciate it or that first chapter with dwarves threatening to break dishes and a flustered Bilbo really set the tone. They've been keeping me amused, although thankfully the story is well-written enough (some children's books are absolutely dire to read as an adult) that I don't mind reading it regardless.

I'm so sad. I wanted this book to go on forever, it was such a comforting and heartwarming read.

I'll be starting the Lord of the Rings next and I'm excited, though I definitely don't expect the same level of innocence of course! But I'm in love with Tolkien's beautiful writing and world-building, and I have no doubt that I will enjoy it as well.

This past week has been dedicated to reading children's classic fantasy (I started with the Earthsea trilogy, now finished the Hobbit). And I'm so glad that I chose to branch out and try these! I've always tended to stick to the magical realism genre as I thought I'd find classic fantasy too boring or confusing. And yes, I will definitely need to give these books a reread as I am not good at absorbing information and keeping track of characters etc. The first time through, but that will just make each reread more fun and exciting. The beauty of Tolkien's language and world-building is just... wow. I can depict everything so vividly and I feel like I'm a child again, exploring my inner world and thinking of faeries and enchanted forests and creatures.

My main question is are there other books besides the main 4 (if there are any) that are worth a read before I start the three Frodo ones? Please try to be as little spoiler-y as possible, if you can. I know Tolkien has other Middle-Earth books: which are the easiest to start with for when I’m done with these?

Edit: I don’t know who Sam is, and I haven’t gotten to the Frodo books yet. That’s not what I mean by gay. There’s a bit of scenes at the start of the book that show Bilbo act in non-traditionally manly ways (I listed one in a reply). That’s all. Thanks for the replies, though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/uq2d5v/hello_starting_the_hobbitlotr_book_stuff/,2022-05-15T09:22:20Z,42,10,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy
oz8v95,Major problem with The Hobbit,"My youngest son decided to read the Hobbit, so I figured I'd refresh my memory of it by reading it again. I've finished it and moved on to Lord of the Rings (as has my son). While I still love the book, I have two problems with the story. I was wondering if anyone else thought these were problems.

Since this regards the ending of the book, spoilers will follow. So please don't read the rest of this until you've read The Hobbit.

With that out of the way, my first problem involves the dragon. Specifically, the slaying of the dragon. Throughout the book, it's hinted at how powerful the dragon is and then it's outright said repeatedly when Smaug fully comes into the story. No problem there. It should be really difficult for the dwarves and Bilbo to kill Smaug, right? 

Well, it would be but Smaug attacks Lake Town and then the story introduces a new character out of nowhere that just happens to have the skills needed to kill Smaug. He can understand thrushes (which gets him the information about Smaug's weakness) and is an excellent archer. There was virtually no setup besides introducing him with no name and little character detail just before Smaug attacks. 

It seems like a bit of a cheat. Bilbo and the Dwarves didn't need to figure out a way to beat the dragon because Deux Ex Archer did it for them.

My second problem concerns the Battle of Five Armies. In this battle, Bilbo puts on his ring early to turn invisible. No problem here. He's not a warrior and so likely wouldn't want to be in a full fledged war. In the same situation, I'd bet any of us would be shoving that ring on our fingers. 

No, my problem is that, again, the protagonists don't seem to have much, if any, effect on the final outcome. Yes, Thorin charges into battle and temporarily turns the tide, but that quickly fades. The good guys look like they'll be defeated when Deux Ex Machina strikes again - this time in the form of the eagles. Nobody called for them. They just show up and retroactively are said to have been watching the goblins' movements.

This doesn't completely ruin the book for me, but it does lead to a question. Should the protagonist have a definitive effect on the ""final battle?"" Are there cases when a Dues Ex Solution is appropriate?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oz8v95/major_problem_with_the_hobbit/,2021-08-06T15:25:29Z,41,35,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy
z477bd,The Hobbit was a big disappointment for me,"A bit of introduction, I wanted to read the Lord of the rings book, and mind you that I haven't watched the movies so I was thinking that I am up for a treat. When I started looking for it, I read that the Hobbit is the precual to the story and there were a lot of people recommending to read it beforehand. 

And by now I am wondering if I am I the only one who thinks that the Hobbit is a very dull book where the characters are lacking real depth and wonder whether to try the Lord of the rings or give it a pass. 

For the record I am not too much into fantasy books, but I really liked the Name of the Wind, and A Song of Fire and Ice, I read a couple of more fantasy books and I thought I might enjoy the Lord of the rings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/z477bd/the_hobbit_was_a_big_disappointment_for_me/,2022-11-25T07:30:29Z,30,0,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

750i5b,"I finally read ""The Lord of the rings"" books, and they were better than I've ever expected.","Warning: spoilers 

Four year ago when I was in high school I bought and read ""the hobbit"". It was a well written book that got me really into the story and excited to read LOTR. So I read the hobbit again, but unfortunately I couldn't get myself to start with LOTR, partly because I bough all three books in one and it looked intimidating to finish, and partly because I started with university and I didn't have much time on my hands till beginning of this summer. 

I start with the fellowship beginning of July and it just hits me hard with nostalgia of the hobbit. Tolkien's style of writing didn't feel tedious like many other stories I've read. He paints a picture and explains in a way that I would've never thought I'm capable of imagining. 

Today I just finished ""The return of the king"" and it's bitter sweet end to me. I feel attached to the books after 3 months of reading and sad that I know I won't wake up to a chapter of the book with my morning coffee. But at the same time I'm happy that I got to read all of it finally and it was such a journey that I've never expected and I recommend the books to anyone and everyone.

But I have one thing that is confusing me, that is the time of the journey (to mount doom and back). At the beginning of the book Bilbo is celebrating his 111th birthday, and a year after that Frodo leaves the shire, when Bilbo is 112. Now after they come back from mount doom, gandalf sits with Frodo and tells him that although it might feel long ago that he started out of the shire, it's only less than a year since then. And that timeline was mentioned I think a few times after. But when they are on their way back to rivendell and celebrate Bilbo's birthday, he is turning 129. That means he grew 17 years older in this one year. Am I missing something here ? What's going on ? 

I would love to hear from other people who've read the books :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/750i5b/i_finally_read_the_lord_of_the_rings_books_and/,2017-10-08T07:54:17Z,834,8957,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy
18p2np4,Should I try and reach out about typo I found in the preface of The Hobbit that dates back to 1987?,"So, I just purchased the most recent English copy of The Hobbit by Tolkien and I was greeted with a preface written by none other than Tolkien’s own son Christopher all the way back in 1987. The iconic opening sentence of the book is pasted in various languages, including my native language, Italian, and I noticed that the word ‘sotto’ (under) is misspelled as ‘sorto’. I don’t own previous copies of the book but through a quick Google search it seems to me that this is a recurring typo in every reprint of the book, that dates back to the 50th anniversary edition almost 50 years ago. I obviously realize that this is a tiny, non-important typo and I myself just find it lightly amusing, but I’m just wondering should I try and let the publishing house know about this in view of future editions? And if so how should I do that?

wtt6z7,"I Just Read ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" for the First Time [SPOILERS]","This book was like chicken soup and a blanket on a cool rainy day. Comforting. It felt a bit more mature -in prose and narrative- than ""The Hobbit"" but just as whimsical. It's only been a year since I read Bilbo's story but seeing him again reminded me how much I missed him. I like the new characters too. Frodo seems clever and observant. Sam is fiercely loyal. I like Merry and Pippin but hope they have more to do in the next book. I felt for Gimli and Balin in Moria. Legolas kinda just seems like he's there to add Elvish lore for now. Boromir was corrupted but I think he's redeemable. Aragorn is cool. Gollum following them from Moria made me anxious. I am not totally sure about Tom but I guess he's just supposed to show that there are things in Middle Earth that are too ancient to be understood? Or maybe he is a spirit? I don't know. He felt like a throwback to ""The Hobbit"" as a children's story character. 


What made this book feel ""comforting"" to me is the characters. They are simply good. Frodo leaves his comfortable life in The Shire to do his part in saving Middle Earth. Merry and Pippin have the opportunity to stop in Lothlorien but continue out of loyalty to Frodo. Sam almost drowning himself insisting that Frodo not go alone to Mordor is a scene that warmed my heart. I love the hobbits but Sam especially. Gimli, Legolas, Boromir, and Aragorn do their part too but it feels more significant coming from hobbits. Small and seemingly powerless heroes overcoming countless dangers for the betterment of others feels good. The characters are also very hopeful. I may be wrong but it feels like pessimism has become increasingly common in real life and fantasy novels alike. It just feels good to read something where even the little guy can be rewarded for their hope and dedication.

v5erph,"100 books 100 songs n1 ""The Hobbit""","Hello everyone, as a totaly self imposed task spawned by my abundance of both free time and love for literature and music, i have decided to review 100 books and pair them with 100 songs. I would appreciate if you guys gave me some feedback both on this idea and the way i write this text, because english is my second language lol.

Okay, lets start with an easy one, J.R.R Tolkien´s ""The Hobbit""

If you had to give someone the easiest entry into fantasy (or literature in general), this would be it, this is the most accesible yet refined piece of fantasy i have read in my entire life, the whole story is brought up in a very inteligent and charismatic way, the diverse adventures that Bliblo goes through are not only entertaining on their own, but they also serve as nice setups for the rest of events going further into the book itself and the entire LOTR franchise moving forward, it serves as both a good starting point in this specific series of books, and, again, fantasy as a whole.

The story itself is a pretty standard hero journey, but hey, thats what fantasy is all about, i would compare it to a really refined melted cheese sandwich (idk what else to call it lol), the thing is just very basic, but it has all of these little things that spice it up and give it a really cohesive feel, while also executing the basics of storytelling and character development in a very magnificent way.

Now to the song part.

Choosing a genre of music for this is rough, mainly because i want you not only to read the book (in this case 99% of you already have), but i also want the song to be enjoyable, and to pair well with the book, so keep that in mindo going forward (also recommend songs you think would fit in this criteria)

The song i will be choosing is the opener for the 1972 prog-rock album by ""Yes"", close to the edge.

The main reason i choose this song, is the parallels it has with the book, it is long but not the longest thing in its field, the basics of the genre and musical composition are executed wonderfully, and it is also basic, but tastefull.

Time for everyones favourite part of reviews by randos on the internet RATINGS!!

The book: 9/10, could be a bit longer, but its almost perfect in this state

The song: 8/10, i kinda want more of those very cathartic ""i get up i get down"" that  Jon Anderson does i think twice if i remember, but other than that its pretty good.

Again, feedback is apreciated, and if you did it this far [here is a video of a cute dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unOeqzSPEIM)

11rze37,Rereading LOTR as an adult vs a teen has made the books 10x more enjoyable,"I loved LOTR as a kid.  All my friends were into it, I loved the movies and the battle scenes.  I loved the video games.   I loved the books too, but I can't say the process of ""reading"" them was as enjoyable as I'd like.  I think I just wanted to read it to get the full story and say I did it.

wp7jkf,The Hobbit in the misty Harz mountains: Reading books in places similar to their settings.,"I moved to the Harz region in Germany a couple of years ago- a very scenic place with lots of forests and lakes and mountains. I used to spend a lot of my free time on hiking paths and would sometimes bring a book with me in case I find a nice spot to sit and read. 

I recently got myself a copy of The Hobbit and I started reading it for the first time on one such hike on a day that was a little mistier than usual. Some of the paths have little wooden huts at certain points along the way so that people could sit down and take a break. I tell you it was such a magical feeling reading the Misty Mountain song in one of those little shacks with a light rain falling and the mist getting denser all around me. As I read on, I could almost feel dwarves trudging up the mountain trail next to me and every large rock seemed to me like it could come to life as a troll at any moment. I know the setting is not a 100% match but it's pretty darn close and it has made reading a more sensory experience and also made me want to go out more even if it rains- actually, especially when it rains and you can actually hear ""the drip of it dropping on the forest floor"" (of course with the book well-protected).

Ok long boast over. There's a good chance that this question has been posted here already, but I couldn't find any direct mentions of it, so I'm curious to find out: Has anyone else had similar experiences? Have you read Crime and Punishment in St. Petersburg? Wuthering Heights in a moor?

It took me a little while to finish, but I really enjoyed The Hobbit. I started fast, got a little slow in the middle, and sped through the finish of the book.

However, I've heard many mixed things about the books. Many people call them the greatest fantasy epics of all time, while I've seen others call them convoluted and difficult to read. I know the writing style is quite different from The Hobbit, but I don't think it's something that I couldn't deal with. However, I wouldn't want to get bored by them if they ended up dragging on.

7r783m,Harry Potter or The Hobbit?,"I am having a discussion with my SO. We were wondering if we could get a large enough sample group to help us with our problem. We were making a scenario where we have children and of course both the hobbit and the harry potter series would be introduced to our future children but we were wondering how we should do it. We are both in our mid 20's and our introductions to the books are both different. We wanted to see how most of you would introduce these to your kids.

Would you read harry potter to your children and let them read the hobbit by themselves? Read the hobbit first and introduce harry potter? Give them the books and let them decide? Read them all to the children or let them read for themselves if they would not be age appropriate? At what age should they absorb these books? Any info would help us greatly! 

And to settle a bet, Tolkien or Rowling?

Thank you to all who respond.

jio9zw,Finished the Hobbit.,"Lovely read through, just thought it was a bit too short. Loved the short adventures of the group, how the trolls followed them from the mountains all the way to their destination for the final showdown. Overall theme I got was about greed and adventure and how friends are easily turned to enemies when money is involved. But its more of a childrens book than anything adult? If I can say (my opinion of course) 

I understood it that because of that greed Smog appeared. But there is a magic to it where the dragon 🐉 is also a form of mysticism and since ancient legends its connected to gold.

j46e4t,"I don't know how unpopular this opinion is, but I prefer The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings","I'm not familiar with this subreddit, so I don't know how popular this opinion is here. I felt Frodo was a drag to follow. He was such a basic protagonist to me, and the convoluted descriptions were unnecessary. Especially in the middle of the second LotR, I had to be consciously focused to keep track of the plot.

I have, however, a bias towards kids books. I love their simplicity and humour. So it's no surprise to me I prefer The Hobbit. I do feel The Hobbit is superior objectively in some aspects, though. Bilbo giving the Elfs and Lake people the  arkenstone, and still returning to the dwarves, surprised me. He was a complex protagonist, who isn't exactly a traitor nor a loyal servent. I'm sorry, but I don't see any of those interesting characteristic in Frodo.

Here's an article I read, when I researched online looking for someone who shared my opinion. He's far more articulate than me [https://www.uncmirror.com/arts/2017/09/25/hobbit-better-lord-rings/](https://www.uncmirror.com/arts/2017/09/25/hobbit-better-lord-rings/)

(Sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my native language)

edit: Hey guys! This post is kinda old now, but I wanted to say some of you changed my mind regarding Frodo and LoTR. I see now Frodo couldn't be as complex as Bilbo, otherwise he would fail on his mission. There were a lot of other good points too, that I didn't think about before.

kodbk9,In regards to The Hobbit.,"Format/Mobile
I'm currently reading J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Hobbit* and as much as it pains me to say this, I don't like it as much as I thought I would. I've always been a huge fan of all things Tolkien but I don't think I'm going to read *The Hobbit* again after I finish it once.

 Compared to Tolkien's other well known books, *The Hobbit* seems very low steaks to me, no ones really in danger if the dwarves don't reclaim their gold, there isn't a particular *reason* they need it. It does offer exposition, and that's honestly the only reason I'm reading it at this point. I understand that this one is more of a kids book, but I'm just kind of disappointed. I'm not at all saying I think its badly written, I just don't understand the dwarves' motive for risking their lives, it doesn't seem worth it.

On a slightly different note, I am finding that Tolkien is very good at matching style to story content. *The Hobbit* is kind of playful and the narration goes along right with that. With *The Lord Of The Rings* trilogy it's more serious, reflecting on the apparent theme and feel of the story. This continues even more so to *The Silmarillion*, so I will definitely give props for the way the writing style directly correlates to the story. 

These are just my current takeaways for having started to read all three of the books I mentioned.( I'm obviously aware that the LOTR trilogy is a trilogy but it's easier to refer to them like this). And I'm expecting my opinion to change slightly as time goes on, but I wanted to put this out there and see if anyone else shared my opinion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kodbk9/in_regards_to_the_hobbit/,2021-01-01T15:46:35Z,9,0,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

5s9wgk,Why The Hobbit Should be Taught in Schools Everywhere,"Whenever I hear that someone hasn’t read the Hobbit, my heart breaks a little for them. It deserves to have a place of honor in every school curriculum around the United States, and even around the globe. Why? Simply because it’s a well-crafted, engaging story with unforgettable characters? There are other stories that meet this criteria. Why Hobbit?

First, The Hobbit should not be enjoyed only by academic elitists. Its message is needed by kids struggling with depression, by bullies, by victims, and by world leaders as much as by college professors. The recent movies have made it accessible to millions of people who may have never read the book, and that is a great step in the right direction. However, the movies can never replace the book.

Throughout the story, the main character Bilbo is given many chances to make good or bad decisions. He could abandon his friends in the dungeons of Mirkwood; he could kill Gollum in the caves; he could run away from the spiders instead of choosing to stand and fight. He could stay with Gandalf outside the Lonely Mountain instead of returning to the dwarves. In all those instances, he makes the hard choice to do the right thing. He is a wonderful example of loyalty, courage, and common sense. As Thorin puts it before he dies, “If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.”

The Hobbit also teaches us that no matter how small or insignificant you may think you are, you can change the world. Today, more than ever, that is a crucial message that all of us need, but no one needs it more than our young people. The next generation, who will determine the shape of our future. Bilbo simply did what he believed to be right in the challenges he faced. He didn’t realize what an enormous impact his decisions would have on the entire world, particularly his decision to spare Gollum’s life. He spared Gollum because it was the right thing to do, and sixty years later, Gollum proved absolutely crucial to the success of Frodo’s mission to save all of Middle Earth from darkness. And as the author himself said, 

“Some believe it is only great power that can hold evil in check, but that is not what I have found. It is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay. Small acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps because I am afraid, and he gives me courage.” ― J.R.R. Tolkien. 

His book demonstrates this perfectly, and it is a lesson needed even more today than when he was alive. With acts of terror on the rise, and rioting becoming all-too common, we need to be teaching our kids the value of being those “ordinary folk” who keep the darkness at bay with small acts of kindness and love.

Too many movies these days show us brooding, dark “heroes.” People who are ultra-strong, or who have special powers. Men or women who spend their days exercising and training with weapons, who are not easily frightened, and take down bad guys every other day. These images are not empowering for ordinary people. Rather, it’s easier to think, “my part is not so important. I’ll let the tough guys handle it.”

By contrast, the hero of The Hobbit is a typical, ordinary person. He’s a bit chubby, and the most exciting thing in his life is gardening. He turns down a chance for adventure, telling Gandalf to look elsewhere. Fortunately, the wizard doesn’t listen to him. He knows that Bilbo is exactly what the company needs. The heroism of Bilbo isn’t dependent on rock-hard muscles, super spy training, or gadgets. It is rather his common sense, bravery in the face of fear, and his ability to choose what is right, even when it’s hard.

Imagine for a moment a schoolteacher pausing to discuss the passage where Bilbo spares Gollum’s life when he escapes from the goblin tunnels. What a rich topic for discussion. Imagine getting an assignment where you’re asked to reflect on the choice Bilbo made there, and whether it was right or wrong. Imagine one of those students later making a decision on whether he should kill a terrorist who is at his mercy, or turn him over to the authorities.

We also learn from The Hobbit that not everyone who is “good” holds the same values. The example of Beorn comes to mind. Beorn was a shapeshifter who was especially dangerous in his bear form, and he was not overfond of dwarves. But he made a strong ally, gave great gifts to Bilbo and the dwarves, and helped turn the tide of battle when it seemed like the goblins were winning. What a great lesson for religious tolerance. Beorn did not share the dwarves’ desire to reclaim their gold and treasure, but he helped them because they did have a common enemy—the goblins.

We have common enemies today—hunger, intolerance, child abuse, oppression—the list goes on. If Beorn could work together with dwarves, a race he didn’t really like, surely Christians, Bhuddists, Jews, Muslims, athiests, Republicans, and Democrats can find common ground and work together on the problems of our world. That’s the hope, anyway. It’s not always easy, especially when the history of violence and intolerance is a long one, like the history between the dwarves and elves. We see this tension towards the end of the book where Thorin and the Elven king threaten each other. But in the end, they both abandon their grudges, and work together to defeat the goblins.

A majority of people learn best from story. Advertisers know this, and sell products through the power of story. One compelling story on Facebook is worth a thousand bullet points of “facts” on a political propaganda campaign. And like it or not, we “learn” a great deal from the movies and tv shows we watch.

Something is needed to counter the often negative “lessons” learned from these sources. That’s where The Hobbit comes in. It’s in story form, which makes it powerful, and the messages in it are relevant for today’s world. Let’s teach our kids to be the ordinary, everyday kind of heroes that Tolkien showed us in Bilbo Baggins. Empower them to change their world, one act of kindness at a time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5s9wgk/why_the_hobbit_should_be_taught_in_schools/,2017-02-05T21:05:48Z,38,39,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

jfvgbi,The Hobbit: Why are there so few books listed as the vehicles for ancient knowledge?,"Edited:

I’m editing and inserting the fact here, which I learned later, that the entire story of Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit is being reprised and finished by Frodo and was started by Bilbo, and is written in a manuscript.

So claims in this thread that “books are too expensive” so people didn’t bother with them, can’t be true. My only point is this: books in many civilisations have a literally holy beginning. They were the creation of scribes and monks that told civilisation’ s most sacrosanct origin stories. 

To my mind, it can’t be that there’s just this one book. And I only wonder why the elves for example, or even the dwarves, make little mention of other holy or secular texts, and why the focus of writing is simply on swords and stones. 

Continue with previous post below: 

Books are mentioned in The Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins owns some. There are cursory mentions of people / characters reading them or being mentioned in them. 

So why are all the runes and transmissions of ancient knowledge etched in swords and rocks and walls and keys and maps and no mention made of books, if any, in this context?

12yehuo,Reading LOTR for the first time in my life!,"I am a person who has never watched the LOTR, and has never really delved much into the realm of classic fantasy. 

This week, I had some unanticipated free time. So, I decided to branch out with my usual reading genre. I first picked up the Earthsea trilogy and read that. Fell in love with the language, characters, and world-building. Then I went for the Hobbit. Thoroughly enjoyed myself, devoured the book.

Now, I've started on the LOTR. I am in love. In love. With the world-building, the language, the characters. I love how it starts with this fantastic introduction to the hobbits. I love Goldberry and I want to draw her (I doodle/draw a lot). I love Frodo and Bilbo of course and all the hobbits. I feel so happy and immersed in this beautiful fantasy world and the escapism from stress. And I have a whole 1000+ book of this to look forward to. I am just so happy with this universe Tolkien created, I've even indulged in a few sketches inspired by how I imagine the characters/setting in my head (drawing is another one of my hobbies, alongside reading). It sounds silly, but every day this week has been made brighter by fantasy. I feel like I have something to look forward to every morning and it's been motivating. I feel happy, youthful, imaginative. It makes me a bit sad that I never picked up these books as a child/teen. I was a voracious reader but I thought that the books would bore me because they were ""classics"" and there was a point in my life where I equated that with boredom. Then, in junior high I actually enjoyed most of the classics we read at school, but I preferred to stick to the same books that I was used to rather than delving into the world of Tolkien. But it's never too late, and I'm so so glad I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and tried!

This has turned into a rant and a half so I apologize but wow. I love this book so much and I'm really really enjoying myself. 

I'd love to hear other people's thoughts about this book, about Tolkien, fantasy, reading etc. (No spoilers please though as I'm only about 200 pages into LOTR)!

If you have a first edition but a later printing that is still very rare (such as T*he Hobbit* or *Dune*) then go ahead and mention it.

I have 1st/1sts of *Snow Crash*, *Ender's Game*, *Dune*, *Hyperion*, *Salem's Lot*, *The Great Hunt*, *The Short-Timers,* and *The Stand*.  My copies of *Snow Crash* and *Hyperion* are signed.

As *Snow Cras*h is signed, I believe that is the single rarest 1st/1st that I have, as only 600 hardcover 1st/1st copies were printed back in 1992, making it one of the smallest first print runs.  Probably only half of those have survived over the last 32 years, and I would imagine only a fraction of those are signed.

dmtmyi,First time reading The Hobbit. Is this Tolkien's typical writing style?,"I'm reading through The Hobbit. I'm just a couple chapters in and while I enjoy the story, I'm somewhat put off by the writing. I understand it was written as more of a children's book than the LotR series (one of my next things I plan on reading). Does this explain what I at times find to be very choppy and rushed writing?

Here's an example I just read that closes the 2nd chapter. To set the scene, Gandalf has just saved the company from the trolls and he's explaining where he was.

>""I went on to spy out our road. It will soon become dangerous and difficult. Also I was anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions. I had not gone very far, however, when I met a couple of friends of mine from Rivendell.""

>""Where's that?"" asked Bilbo. 

>""Don't interrupt!"" said Gandalf. ""You will get there in a few days now, if we're lucky, and find out all about it As I was saying I met two of Elrond's people. They were hurrying along for fear of the trolls. It was they who told me that three of them had come down from the mountains and settled in the woods not far from the road; they had frightened everyone away from the district, and they waylaid strangers. 

>""I immediately had a feeling that I was wanted back. Looking behind I saw a fire in the distance and made for it. So now you know. Please be more careful, next time, or we shall never get anywhere!""

>""Thank you!"" said Thorin.

It's the last two lines there that *really* get me. Just comes off as very unnatural dialogue. I also find the interjection by Bilbo and Gandalf's rebuke a little strange. It's almost like Tolkien is shushing the reader while he rams through a thick section of exposition.

Which brings me to my next point, the rushed pace. I see a lot of ""and then"" followed by a fairly significant thing happening. It seems like a very casual and underwhelming way to lead into the next plot point. Here's an example which highlights this (albeit ""and then"" is not exactly said here).

>""Now stop it!"" said Tom and Bert together. ""The night's gettin' on, and dawn comes early. Let's get on with it!""

>""Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!"" said a voice that sounded like William's. But it wasn't. For just at that moment the light came over the hill, and there was a mighty twitter in the branches. William never spoke for he stood turned to stone as he stooped; and Bert and Tom were stuck like rocks as they looked at him. And there they stand to this day, all alone, unless the birds perch on them; for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the mountains they are made of, and never move again. That is what had happened to Bert and Tom and William.

There's such little ~~queuing~~ cueing that if I hadn't already known the story, I'd probably be halfway into the paragraph before I fully grasped what happened. Tolkien just kind of launches right into it. Maybe I'll come to appreciate that very direct style, but as of now it's a bit off-putting for me.

So is this just his style? I'm hoping the more adult LotR novels are a little more sophisticated in their writing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dmtmyi/first_time_reading_the_hobbit_is_this_tolkiens/,2019-10-25T06:55:39Z,20,3,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

ibe0r8,"After YEARS of wanting to read them but never getting past chapter 1, I finally finished Lord of the Rings today!","My goodness what a journey this has been, for years I had avoided seeing the movies because I wanted to read the books first, but never got more than a few pages in cause it just seemed like such a dense read and I was never in the mindset to do it.

I sat down at the beginning of quarantine and finally started reading Fellowship very seriously, making sure I took it slow and read very closely. There were definitely parts of these books that I was more than a little bored throughout, but the parts that grabbed me REALLY grabbed me!

I had to take a good amount of breaks for a few weeks at a time, and once I even thought there was no way I was going to finish just cause it felt like way too big of a feat. So glad I pushed through cause the payoff was IMMENSE! I read the last 150 or so pages in one sitting which was so rare for me with these books. So happy I pushed through and took the time to read them, even with all the lulls I completely understand why they're held in such high regard, and everybody should give them a shot if they haven't!

Also, if you're struggling to get through a long book or series, it's totally okay - put the book down for a little bit, move on to something else, but come back to it. You'll find that a bit of a break is a really good refresher!

Edit: Should have said this, I have read The Hobbit probably 5 or 6 times since I was a kid and love it, I think it was a bit of a shock trying to read these expecting the same world from the same writer but having the writing style be so drastically different even though the world was familiar",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ibe0r8/after_years_of_wanting_to_read_them_but_never/,2020-08-17T13:21:20Z,748,13708,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

opqf19,"After about 17 years, I finally made myself start the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I'm so glad I did.","The first time I have ever heard of the LoTR, was when the movies came out, and it was about the same time as Harry Potter movies were coming out as well. Not knowing any better (at all), I compared the two series (I was obsessed w HP) and as a result, was bullied in class. Badly. 

As a result, its been really difficult for me to read the main series (I read the hobbit one summer for summer reading and loved it) and watch the movies, because it always brought my mind back to those days and reminded me of those who bullied me. 

Well this year I made the resolution to read all my TBR pile before buying any new books, and the LOtR books were a part of it. I decided to bite the bullet and get started. Well just over two weeks later I have 50 pages left of the Fellowship and plan to bring the second book with me on vacation to read on the beach. 

I'm so glad I finally gave this series a chance. I knew I was a stubborn, ignorant, shitty 6th grader, but man those girls were bitches. The story is so enveloping it's become difficult to put down and, when I finally got started reading, those triggering thoughts never came to mind. 

I'm sorry that I compared this to Harry Potter, and I'm sorry it took this long to finally open these books, but I'm just so happy that I did, and look forward to reading the next two. 

Sidenote, if it's important to know - I have watched the movies, but that was so long ago I don't remember any of them, and even then I still felt uncomfortable because they still reminded me of those darker times. I plan on rewatching the movies as I finish the books, so I'm hoping I'll be in a better mind space to do so.

This being said, will I enjoy LotR? I've heard it's more advanced, but how much more? I'm the type of person that enjoys intellectually stimulating fiction, and if the plot is going to be predictable, the characters utterly boring and there's still going to be a large absence of dialogue, I'd honestly rather not waste my time.

So far I did not expect the series to be this ""easy to read"". Given the fandom and pop culture I thought it would be lore- and word-heavy. As I am currently going through the Cosmere I was prepared, but I was pleasantly surprised. I like the series. Also it was kind of a shock that The Hobbit is such a short book, but somehow they made three movies about it?

iu4mty,My son was born prematurely and reading books created a deeper bonding during his time in the hospital.,"
My son, Sage, was born 13 weeks early and my wife had to have an emergency cesarean. For those 13 weeks, Sage had to spend his time in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).
While in NICU, Sage was on the CPAP (Continuous positive airway pressure) to help him breathe. Everytime we had cares with him, we were allowed to have skin to skin cuddles with him, once a day. My wife and I took turns. 
My wife began reading kids books but because they were so short and the minimum time we could have skin to skin was 30 minutes, each day, those small books became repetitive. 
Being an advocate reader of fantasy, I decided I would The Hobbit to him. Each skin to skin cuddles I read to him. Within 3 weeks, I finished The Hobbit, but I still wanted to read fantasy but I felt LOTR would've been frowned upon by the nurses so instead, I began HP and the Philosophers Stone. 
Now, Sage is out of hospital and at home. I've finished HP and now up to the fourth book. 

This post is an appreciation to how reading books changed the quality of time spent with my son in NICU and how it has helped put him to sleep at home. 
I can't describe how much reading books to him has strengthened my love for him. Even though he won't remember the stories I read to him, he knows my voice and that helps him sleep. 

Without that time reading with my son, the hospital would’ve been a bleak and horrible experience for our family. Thank you books. 

TL;DR - Son was in hospital for 13 weeks and I read him, The Hobbit and HP. Now my son is home, the quality reading time in the hospital strengthened our bond and has helped his sleeping patterns at home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iu4mty/my_son_was_born_prematurely_and_reading_books/,2020-09-16T21:01:21Z,33,1207,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

32pxex,The Hobbit: Watching the films before reading the book ruined it for me.,"I'd been planning read the works of Tolkien, starting with the Hobbit, after thoroughly enjoying the movies and the trilogy, because I thought the books are always more detailed and descriptive right?

SPOILER! Ahead (Just in Case)

* Well, not quite. (Atleast *that's* my take). Jackson was able to cover almost all parts of the book by dividing it into 3 movies.
* And I am getting really annoyed while reading the book, because now I can practically narrate the entire thing, and that makes the great book, as it is, nothing but a pain to read.

Lastly, why is the book and movie drastically different in some dialogue scenes? Some examples can be, the scenes of :

* Conversations of : Bilbo and Gollum ; Thorin's Company and Beorn (<-- this one especially.)
* The way the company got saved by the Eagles (Gandalf and the butterfly? Pfft.)
* Their time at Rivendell (along with : *almost* nothing is there to show that the dwarves and elves didn't like each other)
* Their capture by the goblins. (Bilbo did not just got separated like that from the company in the movies.)
* 
* 
* ... and probably much more to come as : *I don't know how*, but I'm now at the chapter of Flies and Spiders, *crawling* and *dragging* through the pages.

40smfl,"As an adult who has already seen the movies, I read the Hobbit for the first time.","Similar to a post I saw on here yesterday, I grew up in an ultra-conservative Midwest family. So when I ventured home from middle school one day long ago with the Fellowship of the Ring in my arms, I was promptly banned from reading all Tolkien books since they dealt with ""witchcraft and necromancy"" and ""went against the teachings of Jesus"". It was some years later, after seeing the LOTR movies themselves, that my parents apologized saying the stories were actually very good (thanks, Peter Jackson...for now). Anyway, I recently took it upon myself, as a closet Tolkien fanboy for many years, to read the full chronicles of his series starting with The Hobbit.

Minor spoilers (to movie and book alike) ahead. Having been fully immersed with the movies already as well as much of the underlying lore, it was interesting to read The Hobbit when I did. There is a natural tendency to play the movie in your head as you read, and to this, Peter Jackson rendered a quite faithful adaptation of the book in the beginning (minus that whole Arkenstone business). It was not until the troll scene that I began to notice significant deviations in the film adaptation. And that's what I wanted to discuss here - as I am sure has been hashed out in countless threads in countless subreddits already.

The first installment of The Hobbit movies was generally faithful, although I rather enjoyed the book scene involving the goblins and Wargs that led to the Eagle rescue. Perhaps as an apologist, I can understand the addition of the Orc hunt in the movies in order to present a driving force to the narrative. The unfortunate consequence of that Orc business is the total loss (or may as well be) of Beorn and the Mirkwood! It is here, without the deus ex machina help from Gandalf and Co., that we really sense the key character development of Thorin and Co., and particularly Bilbo. I was simply amazed by these wonderful passages, comprising a good chunk of the overall story, that were completely overshadowed in the movies. In a similar vein, I felt the approach of the Lonely Mountain and search for the hidden door was a key moment of despair and self-realization that was wholly lacking in the movie.

Never mind Peter Jackson's inventions to the story, such as the awakened ring, the orc hunt (with Azog still alive), the unlikely romance between Tauriel and Kili, the Bard subplot, and so forth. These additions, I can somewhat understand and forgive for film adaptation purposes. But I felt there was a genuine loss to the meaning of the story in the film adaptation, and I would have gladly paid the extra $9.00 to watch a fourth installment if the missing sections could have been portrayed in one manner or another.

The Hobbit is an amazing story about a small hobbit who, through his adventures, learned there was much more to himself than even he thought, but that is totally lost in the films, which are a high fantasy adaptation of The Amazing Race (team Thorin and Co.). Nevertheless, I enjoyed both the book and the movie, and having already seen the movie certainly influenced my imagination for the better (especially Rivendell). I am very much looking forward to reading the LOTR books and beyond.

cedlbb,At 30 years old I finally read The LOTR Trilogy,"I read The Hobbit years ago and loved it, absolutely loved it.  But, when I bought the LOTR Trilogy and started reading The Fellowship of the Ring, I just could not get into the book.  I don't know why and looking back I think I was expecting a book that was more like The Hobbit that was written for a younger audience.  I know now, that I just wasn't ready to fully appreciate these books.  And so, I put Fellowship down and never picked the books up again.

Sad to say, I would even tell people, ""Yeah I loved The Hobbit, but the other books are just a bunch of walking for chapters on end.""  I'm a bit ashamed at how I characterized the Trilogy based off my single attempt at reading them in my teens.  And yet, I was a huge fan of the movies.  I assumed that, for once, the movie adaptations were better than the books.  I even bought the extended cut DVDs of the LOTR Trilogy I liked them so much.  I never thought to pick the books back up and give them a proper second chance during all these years.

Recently, luckily enough, I started to see quite a few LOTR posts on Reddit that detailed all the little facts about the books that were missing in the movies.  I read these posts and was genuinely interested because, it seemed to me, there was a lot of the story missing that even the extended DVDs did not have time to cover.  My curiosity was peaked enough that now, at 30, I picked the Trilogy up again and finally made up my mind to read them.
I COULD NOT put these books down!  They were absolutely amazing.  I cannot believe that I ignored these books for years.  But, I believe that coming to these books now, at my age, allowed me to actually appreciate these books properly.

So, my advice; if you haven't read the books, please read them now, they are worth your time.  If someone told you that they are just a ""bunch of chapters of walking,"" let me apologize to you for them, they do not know what they are talking about.  If you were that person who, like me, tried to read these before and could not get engaged, please give them a second chance, you won't be disappointed.

I knew there was something in there I probably liked, but the pressure, time constraints, and looming chapter quizzes sucked any enjoyment there was to be had from that book.

Years later the movies came out, and as we all know they were incredible. I will never forget seeing the battle of Minas Tirith on the big screen, but I've also made so many wonderful memories over the years watching and rewatching those films with friends.

I developed a love for reading once school ended (go figure), but the lingering hatred for the Lord of the Rings books was too strong for me to jump back in to them. Then a few months ago I saw the trilogy on a bookshelf at my parent's house, and figured they wouldn't mind if I borrowed them.

I'm about 150 pages in, and man... it is so enjoyable to read these books today, after all these years. I still wish I could have enjoyed them as a young man, but I am soaking in the experience of truly reading The Lord of the Rings for the first time.

Some observations on the book as opposed to the movies:

1. The pace is so much different. The first movie starts with a frantic pace, which I loved. The adventure shoots out the gate the day Frodo chances on the ring, every sequence in the film has clear and high stakes, and every scene bleeds into the next. The book is nothing like that. Tolkien sets the lore, the slow pace gives the story depth, and you feel immersed in the world he creates. It's been quite a surprise for me to approach the stories this way, and I really enjoy it so far.
2. The Hobbits are much more mature, fully realized characters than they are in the movie. Don't get me wrong, I thought they were portrayed incredibly well by Elijah Wood and the likes, but in the films the Hobbits are a bit more whimsical and kinda tailor made for movies. Frodo is the lead, Pippin and Merry are the comic relief, and Sam is the glue that holds it together. But in the books, Merry and Pippin are far smarter and less bumbling than they are in the movies. Sam is still a loyal companion, but he has fears and flaws. All four just seem smarter, more capable, and fully realized than they are in the movie.
3. Extra characters. I love the bickering of the Hobbits in the Shire, it makes it feel like an old folk's home, but moreover they just have the sort of traits that make characters whole. The Black Riders are far more shadowy and creeping in the books, especially in Frodo's dreams. They meet Gildor and the elves long before they even arrive in Rivendell - I loved that scene! And Fatty Bolger, Tom Bombadil... what great characters. There's so much more to enjoy in the book already.

I'll share more of my impressions after I finish all three if this post is interesting to people. But the main takeaway for me so far is... man, reading is so much more enjoyable when there's no one breathing down your neck. I'm so fortunate I get to read these books, and I wish I had earlier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18577ut/first_time_reading_the_fellowship_of_the_ring/,2023-11-27T16:41:14Z,42,101,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

1317y7,Rereading The Hobbit --Spoilers and Junk,"So one of the handful of books I read when I was younger was the Hobbit.  With the movie coming out I thought I would take the time to reread it just for nostalgic purposes.

Let me just list some themes I found this time.

1)  Bilbo constantly wishing he had food.
2)  Almost the entire group is captured over and over again, first trolls (saved by gandalf), then goblins (saved by gandalf), caught in trees (saved by eagles), caught by spiders (saved by bilbo), caught by wood elves (""saved"" by bilbo)
3)  Every time they take a break somewhere, they stay for two weeks.  Just chilling out I guess.  The elves, Beorn's , when they arrive in Lake town.
4) Unprepared-- Besides the fact that this group has no idea what they are doing, (except for where they are going), and that they need to be saved over and over again, they literally have no idea how to kill Smaug, the dragon.  At the end of the day they are really saved a 6th time by the Bard that kills the dragon.  They basically say to themselves ""So what are we going to do when we get to Smaug?  How are we going to kill him?""  and the only answer they come up with is something like, ""We'll think of something.""

Anyway i'm just trying to figure out why I liked this book to begin with.  Bilbo didn't even make his own hobbit hole, he inherited it from his parents.

I dunno, I don't want to be a literary hater or whatever but bleh.  This time rereading the story was only interesting because I was amazed at all of the themes I didn't catch before.  Themes that, to be honest just weren't that interesting.

But again, it is a children's book so what did I expect?

skrsem,Man... Tolkien didn't have to go so hard with the tale of Beren and Luthien in Fellowship of the Ring,"First time reading Lord of the Rings... Yay!

Not even halfway through, and it's already a 9/10! Tolkien has such a homey way of writing magic and adventure, it's modest and easy to follow, while being completely OVERFLOWING with lore and detail. Almost like your favorite teacher, or an old man that you look up to is reminiscing a great tale.

And let me tell you, something happened that elevated this book to 10/10, and that's the story of **Beren and Luthien.** 

When this plot diversion occurs, Frodo, his Hobbit friends, and Strider are all sitting around a fire at Weathertop. They're all weary, and nervous of the Nazgul stalking them, so Strider tells them a story to pass the time. 

What follows can only be described as **mythologic**. A classical epic. Lore, of the absolute highest caliber. 

*In the first age,* *Beren was the son of the king of Men, Barahir. At the time, They led a force to destroy the ancient king of darkness, who yet goes unnamed but it's obvious who it is, and of whom Sauron was merely a servant... And they lost. The force of men was destroyed, Barhir was killed, and Beren barely escaped into the wild with his life....*

*Eventually, after wandering the forest after many days, he came upon a beautiful Elf singing, whom he named Luthien Tueniviel. They soon fell in love, she restored his strength and gave him purpose, and together they faced many perils....*

Keep in mind, this page-long epic story is being told WHILE Frodo and his gang are having their own epic adventure!

*Beren and Luthien together overthrow the dark lord! Claiming the prize that the Dark Lord treasured, Beren was set to marry Luthien. But the Dark Lord would have his revenge... a great wolf was released from the Dark Lords domain, and he tragically killed Beren in battle. Luthien, an immortal elf, forsook her immortality in order to be together in death with her love. It was a tragic end, but also really quite reassuring knowing that they were together.*

*It is said that their spirits walked the forest once more before departing from this mortal realm....*

IDK about you, but I consider this an ***amazing*** diversion. It's so excellently told, flowing with description and narrative beauty, and it serves to build the lore and history of a world that has only had one other book up to that point! It's so complete, it could be legitimate mythology. Not to mention, the clear narrative parallels between Aragorn and Arwen :)

I've no doubt Tolkien has many more epic stories like these. Can't wait to see what more is in store, lore-wise! 

It's just so amazing \^v\^",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/skrsem/man_tolkien_didnt_have_to_go_so_hard_with_the/,2022-02-04T23:29:36Z,400,3051,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

I thought I would ask the opposite. It doesn't necessarily have to be one title it can be a series but I'd like you to chose which one you rank above all and for what reason. For me, if I had to choose the first book that comes to mind is The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy which is one of my all-time favorite books.

n5kc6,"The Hobbit, Book Review","The Hobbit—Rating: 5 out of 5

	We've all heard of or seen The Lord of The Rings Trilogy, but how many of us have given the books they're based on a try? Or how many of us have given their epic prelude, The Hobbit, a chance?
This book is sure to beyond satisfy any Tolkien fan looking for an expansion on the story of Middle Earth.
 
	The story revolves around Bilbo Baggins, a homely hobbit of The Shire who just wants to live a calm and peaceful life. One day a wizard named Gandalf came to Bilbo's door with 13 dwarves and told Bilbo of an adventure he was to take part in. Reluctantly Bilbo found himself accompanying the 13 dwarves and wizards on a quest to slay a dragon named Smaug and reclaim the innumerable amounts of lost dwarven treasure. On his quest, Bilbo and the dwarves encountered many evil foes like goblins, spiders, trolls, and wargs (evil large wolves). I'll save the ending and inner details to keep from ruining the novel for those who haven't read it.

	Tolkien uses many suspenseful events in the story to make the book as suspenseful as possible. If I were to grade this movie on an academic scale (F to A) I would give it an A. I honestly can't think of more than perhaps one minor flaw in the story. You'll find yourself glued to this book within pages of reading it. All of the fantastic plot twists and extensive detail make you feel as if you're in the protagonist's shoes as he overcomes all odds. The only advice I would give the author on improving the book would be to add more information on the other main characters besides Bilbo. Nonetheless if you're looking for a book in the fantasy genre to read I strongly suggest The Hobbit.

	If you have already read The Hobbit or are planning to read it check out Peter Jackson's upcoming cinematic rendition of the book. The movie is to be released into two separate parts. Part one—An Unexpected Journey—is expected to be released in 2012; part two—There and Back Again—is supposed to be released in 2013. The movies have already received huge anticipation from fans of both Tolkien and Jackson's works.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n5kc6/the_hobbit_book_review/,2011-12-09T00:25:04Z,11,4,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

ty2nor,The Hobbit | Live Audiodrama | April 11 At 8 Pm EST / 5 PM PST- Hosted by r/LOTR_on_Prime,"# Hello folks!

On Monday, April 11, 2022 at 8 PM EST or 5 PM PST our subreddit r/LOTR_on_Prime is hosting a Live Audiodrama of The Hobbit. The company that will be voice acting this is called [Audiotorium](https://twitter.com/AUDIOTORIUMLIVE) and they are a Social Audio Production Studio.

# What is a Talk?

Reddit Talk is a new feature that is still currently in testing on Reddit where subreddits can host voice chat. Audiotorium previously hosted a Reddit Talk where they did a Halloween special. If you, or your subreddit is interested in applying for your subreddit to be approved to have Talk enabled you can find out more details on r/RedditTalk.

# What is the catch?

There is none, I promise. I am not here trying to swindle you fine folks into getting an extended warranty on your vehicle or have any personal gain. I simply want to do something that I believe is cool, drama free, and would show off the voice acting chops of the team while also showing off a new Reddit Feature.

# What do I have to do?

This part is simple. Just tune in when the event goes live. During the event you will be able to react to things with emojis and comment in the thread while its live. It is possible, once it is over, if you want to come up on the stage and talk to the team you can wave your hand ( its a button I promise ) and they can call you up to talk for a bit. Outside of that? Just listen to the experience and enjoy yourself. Its a child-friendly story and the cool part about a Talk is that if you are an audience member you can minimize your app if its the official reddit app and the audio will continue to play.

# Will we get a notification when this is live?

The way Talks work, to not spam the entirety of Reddit, you will only be notified that this event is live if you are subscribed to the r/LOTR_on_Prime subreddit. So what is my recommendation? Subscribe until the event goes live next week and then unsubscribe once its over if you do not wish to see discussions about the upcoming Rings of Power show. My feelings will not be hurt and I encourage it!

# What if I can't make it?

I completely understand that most of the world won't be able to make it live. One cool feature of the Talk is that is should record and be available later that night or the next day. Again, this feature is in testing and there could be hiccups.

# Have any other questions I didn't answer above?

Please drop a comment below and I will do my best to answer them. I ran this by the moderators on this sub before posting this here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ty2nor/the_hobbit_live_audiodrama_april_11_at_8_pm_est_5/,2022-04-07T02:23:47Z,2,6,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

3bqj80,"Finally picked up LOTR again after 15 years, and finished it for the first time. Some books are meant for different times in our lives. I'm so sad the story is over!","When I was around 11-12, I picked up the Hobbit and loved it. Afterwards, I started reading LOTR and was only able to read part of the first book, Fellowship of the Ring. I even remember the chapter I stopped on - Council of Elrond. It was too long and plodding for me at the time, but I vowed I would come back.  


Flash forward, I'm 26 and just finished the trilogy for the first time. I just put down Return of the King last night and got a little emotional. It had taken me so long to get back to these books! But I see now that even if I had pushed myself through them at 12, I wouldn't have fully understood the nuances of Tolkien's writing.    



His insights into the burdens of leadership through characters like Gandalf and Aragorn were particularly meaningful. As a kid, I still saw the leaders in my life as infallible, privileged, or corrupt. Now that I'm older, I understand that part of what it means to be a leader is to never be loved by everyone - to always be misunderstood by someone. To make tough decisions when there is no clear path, understanding that those decisions may go awry. 


I'm reading the books with my fiance, who has never been big into fantasy and tends to mock the books and characters from time to time. But Tolkien's writing meant a lot to me as a kid and now even more so as an adult. 


I'm looking forward to picking up my next read, but mourning a bit now that my adventure has come to an end! Though I guess Tolkien would say it's simply the beginning of a different adventure. The story goes on!

It took quite a while to get in to it, probably about half way through the book, then all of a sudden the pace picked up and I kept wanting to read more. I'm not sure if most books are similar, in that it takes a while to get hooked, or if it's just my first few will be like that, but it was great and I'm happy I actually managed to finish something! The book itself was great, although as many people said, Discworld seems to be a very acquired taste, and structured differently to other books (no chapters for example), so I'm not sure I'll jump in to other Discworld books before trying out some other authors first.

I've now started Ready Player One and thats great so far too! Trying to read that fully before the film comes out to see if I turn in to one of those ""the book is better than the film"" kind of people.

ac9okd,Today is J.R.R. Tolkien’s 127th Birthday! How have the Professor’s writings impacted you over the years?,"Hey y’all! For myself, I have loved Tolkien ever since my dad read The Hobbit and the LOTR to me before bed when I was little. I read both books for myself a little bit later and adored them, and this led me to seek out the Silmarillion and pretty much everything that has been written by the man. I love the presentation of hope and courage amidst the tragedy of Middle-Earth, how darkness and light war eternally, but that hope and courage must be maintained, lest goodness itself become evil by copying it. I love the simple courage and goodness of the hobbits contrasts with the great beauty and power of the elves, and how things are presented as being ‘greater’ than others, but this doesn’t make them better. 

While this is somewhat rambling, I hope it got across that I love Tolkien and his writings. He has left a deep imprint on my imagination and mind.

So what are your own thoughts on Tolkien and his writings? Do you like him? Dislike him? Feel confused by all the clamor around his works? Put it here.

32ropa,The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien,"~~I recently completed reading The Hobbit. Unfortunately, I watched the movies before reading the book. Therefore, I had high expectations from it. I was excited to know how The Company would take down Smaug on their own. But the killing of Smaug by Bard seemed to take the very plot out of the plot. Moreover, the story that follows isn't very intriguing; and the Battle Of the Five Armies seemed unnecessary.
                                The story is brilliantly written by Tolkien but the plot seems to lose it's meaning towards the end. Does anyone else think so?~~
* EDIT: Thank you all for your answers. But.....Let me rephrase my question..... you see, this isn't related to the movies. That was just FYI. My question was that, in the book, doesn't it seem odd that the whole adventure was related to the killing of Smaug and taking back the Lonely Mountain, but Smaug isn't killed by the Dwarves, but by Bard, who is never even mentioned before that point. Even the 'goblin' part has been described in great detail, But during the climax of the whole adventure, the slaying of the (supposedly) main villain Smaug, isn't. And out of the blue, the Battle Of the Five Armies takes place. The plot completely changes.

1tvvp4,"Just ordered Lord of the rings trilogy, the hobbit and the silmarillion. Help me out!","I was looking to read all of the lord of the rings books because I have been bored lately so I figured reading a highly regarded series might be fun to do in my spare time.  I wouldn't consider myself a big book reader, and in fact have never really read a book just for pleasure.  I have read books in high school and middle school though, and have really enjoyed most of them even though I remember loathing over whenever I had to read a book for an assignment, they ended up being addicting once you got into the story.  I have seen all 3 lord of the rings movies but haven't seen either of the hobbit movies.  I really enjoyed the 3 movies and they are probably up there with the best movies I have ever seen.  But I am not really that familiar with the whole story/lore behind the movies/books and the conflicts within the movie.  I really don't even know the characters that aren't the main ones that well.

So anyway, I just could use some tips/suggestions for when reading these books.

What order should I read them in?
Is there anything I need to know in order to understand what I am reading?
Should I see the hobbit movies before reading the book? or maybe after I read the book?
Any particular chapter or information that I should focus on to understand the plot more?

Just any information that you could give me would be nice!

* Scrooge isn't so much a grumpy person as he is a penny-pinching miser. He hates Christmas because it interrupts normal business. He hates *anything* that would interrupt him making money.
* Scrooge would hate getting a Peloton bike. It's an exercise bike that costs $1,495. Scrooge refuses to spend any of his hoard on heating in the dead of winter, why would he want a bike that costs that much *and* requires the purchase of a $40/month subscription.
* Gifts don't make Scrooge happy. Nothing makes him happy. He's more bitter than the frozen winds of winter.
* In *A Christmas Carol*, gifts don't change Scrooge, fear does! For him, the Ghost of Christmas Future is a Grim Reaper who shows Scrooge his own lonely death, and this scares the man into helping others.
   * Scrooge actually ends up helping others in *A Christmas Carol*!

For anyone who's read the original, the ad seems to ignore the original in its entirety!

I know I'm nitpicking a Peloton ad. It just bugs me.

2odkfb,Question about the Lord of the Rings in relation to the new Hobbit movie (The Battle of The Five Armies),"r/books, I need your help.

This is a movie/book crossover question. 

I have read the Hobbit. I have not read The Lord of the Rings, nor have I seen any of the movies. 

I have avoided watching any of The Lord of the Rings movies because I want to finish the books first. (I'm currently in the middle of The Fellowship).

I did watch the first 2 Hobbit movies (after I finished the book), and I noticed in the 2nd movie there was stuff I didn't recognize (which I assume was from the LotR books/movies?).



... I hate spoilers. I don't watch trailers, I don't read the backs of books etc. 

...I'm pretty obsessive about this, it drives me nuts when I know *anything* about a movie/book before I experience it.

What do you guys think? Safe to watch the last Hobbit installation, or will it have spoilers for the rest of the series.

Me and my hypervigilance thank you!

2f5l7y,Theory about link between The Shining & The Hobbit,"
Ok, so this is just a theory and I welcome your thoughts...  (sorry it's long!!  Also I already know that I’m not an expert on literature, or on either book, or on anything.)

So I was watching The Desolation of Smaug on HBO earlier and when Bilbo & the dwarves reach the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo says something about Gandalf should be waiting for us at ""the overlook.""  Somehow, that sent a flag up in my mind, so I did some research online.  To summarize, I think that Stephen King's book ""The Shining"" is somewhat based on this section of The Hobbit.

The Overlook/Lonely Mountain =  The Overlook Hotel in the Rocky Mountains

Thror = Delbert Grady (previous hotel caretaker)

Thorin = Jack Torrence

Bilbo =  Danny Torrence

Gandalf =  Dick Hallorann

Smaug = Hotel Boiler
 
Arkenstone = Psychic Powers

Sauron (?) = Horace Derwent (?) <evil in the hotel>


1.  Stephen King is a big Tolkien fan who has a history of setting LOTR
stuff into the United States (he admitted it about “The Stand” in Stephen King from A to Z: An Encyclopedia of His Life and Work)


2.  The Lonely Mountain is the source of the Celduin River and it’s the location of the Kingdom Under the Mountain.  The town of Dale lies in a vale on its Southern slopes.  Correspondingly (maybe) the Overlook Hotel is set in the Colorado Rocky Mountains and has the town of Vail to the South.  The Colorado River’s source is here.


3.  Dale and the surrounding areas, which were burnt by Smaug, are called “The desolation of Smaug.”  There is a place called East Desolation Peak near the real Overlook hotel—the Stanley hotel—which Stephen King said was where he stayed and that inspired the fictional Overlook hotel.


4.  In The Hobbit, the Overlook area has a tragic history due to all the deaths & destruction from the dragon.  In The Shining, the Overlook hotel has a violent past including the deaths of guests and more recently, the deaths of the last caretaker and his family—he “got cabin fever” and killed them.


5.  In the Peter Jackson movie, Thror (Thorin Oakenshield’s predecessor as King Under the Mountain) went mad with greed.  However, Smaug the dragon implies that it was the Arkenstone that corrupted him when he says to Bilbo, “I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer, watch it destroy him, watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad…”   I don’t know much about Thror, but the Arkenstone gave it’s owner the authority/power to rule the dwarves.  So maybe he was power & money hungry?  Anyway, in The Shining, I assume that the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady, actually went crazy from the same evil spirits who influence Jack Torrence.  One of these “spirits” is a past owner(?) of the Overlook named Horace Derwent.  Derwent is described as being an “evil genius” who was extremely corrupt and got rich from his involvement in organized crime, high level politics, gambling, etc.  It is said that his spirit inhabits the Overlook Hotel, but his death was never confirmed. (WTF?)   The evil spirits of the Overlook (especially Derwent) desperately want Jack to kill Danny in order to obtain his shining/psychic powers.  Jack gradually loses himself because of he is influenced or possessed to kill Danny.  In the same way, Thorin Oakenshield begins to lose himself and change because he becomes obsessed with getting the Arkenstone.


6.  Therefore, I think that the Arkenstone = The Shining/Psychic powers.  The Hobbit book says that the Arkenstone has it’s own pale light, but when exposed to outside light, it shone brilliantly.  When Danny first arrives at the Overlook hotel and meets the cook, Dick Hallorunn (who also has the shining ability), he warns Danny that the hotel is dangerous for people with the gift and can intensify it.
Now, I am not an evil spirit, so I don’t know why the hotel’s evil spirits want psychic abilities, but maybe it has something to do with the power to rule over others, like the Arkenstone’s significance to the dwarves.


7.  The previously mentioned Dick Hallorunn has a special connection/friendship with Danny because he can see that Danny has the shining power like he does, and also likely because Danny is a nice kid and Dick is a nice person.   Maybe it’s because he knows that Danny is in for a dangerous time and he can relate because he has worked in the hotel and knows its evil.  But, for whatever reason, they have a bond and a connection.  Similarly, Gandalf has a special place in his heart for Bilbo saying (in the movie) “Why Bilbo Baggins?  Perhaps it is because I am afraid and he gives me courage.’  Now, in The Shining, Hallorunn leaves the Overlook hotel for the winter and has to come back to help save Danny from Jack.  In the same way, Gandalf is not at the Overlook /Lonely Mountain while Bilbo is dealing with Thorin and the dragon.  But, Gandalf comes to help the situation at the end.


8.  Sort of covered before---  Bilbo is brave and selfless.  He is willing to risk facing a dragon to look for the Arkenstone.  Spoiler:  He is willing to give up the Arkenstone to avoid a war.  Danny is also very brave and selfless.  In The Shining (book), Danny’s mom, Wendy, wants to leave Jack behind early on an take Danny away from there, but Danny resists because he thinks the hotel is making Jack happy.  Danny is also able to face all the creepy stuff that happens in the hotel.  


9.  Smaug the dragon has been sleeping deep in the mountain, but awakens due to Bilbo’s presence.  He starts getting really mad, breathes lots of fire, and then destroys part of the Lonely Mountain getting out of it.  At the end of the book The Shining, the boiler in the basement of the hotel (which had ostensibly not been used until the winter) is turned on and gets hotter and hotter until it explodes and destroys the hotel.


10.  Ok, finally, I know it’s a stretch but  Torrence sounds like Thorin (kinda)

*Weird fact, the book The Shining was nominated for a Gandalf award in 1978

1i68mk,"Hated ""The Hobbit"", didn't like ""1984"".","Hey everyone. It's summer time and even though I work during the day, on my way to work and back home I started listening to audiobooks in order to be as efficient with my time as possible. The very first book I 'read' was ""World War Z"" by Max Brooks (abridged) and oh, man, sometimes I couldn't stop listening. This book has set a very high standard for the narration. Aside from the fact that I enjoy post-apocalyptic movies/books/games, this book was a joy to listen to. 

Then, after researching this subreddit for my next book to ""read"", I stopped on ""The Hobbit"". First of all, I didn't like the beginning at all. I thought it was very boring, it did not intrigue me at all. Rob Inglis did a pretty good job but I stopped reading the book after an hour or so. 

Then I picked up ""1984"" as this book is always in the very top of every ""Must Read"" list. Although I found it to be better than ""The Hobbit"", I had to force myself to read it. The story did not particularly interest me (there was a story?) - it sounded like a very dry description of the dystopia the main character is living in. It was very clear what the society was like and I felt like the author was trying to say the same thing over and over again using different words. I gave up around chapter 8...

In the past, I've read books such as ""Crime and Punishment"" by Dostoevsky (enjoyed it a lot), ""Oblomov"" by Goncharov, ""Resurrection"" by Leo Tolstoy (yes, these were for a class and I actually read the paper books in Russian, but I enjoyed these novels), ""The Things They Carried"" by Tim O'Brien (by a friend's recommendation - very good book). 

To be honest, I don't know what kind of book I'd enjoy listening to next. What I really liked in the 3 books by the Russian authors is that in all 3 of them there was a very good character development. Throughout each of the stories, I felt very engaged and connected with the characters as if they were me.

Based on what I just told you, what would be your book recommendations for me? 

**TL;DR:** didn't like 1984 and The Hobbit, but enjoyed Crime and Punishment. Book recommendations? 

**EDIT:** I think one of the problems is that it's harder for me to imagine the places and worlds described in these books if someone else read them to me. When I read a paper book, I make up my own images of characters and places, but when I hear the same lines in someone else's voice, then everything becomes skewed and I don't enjoy it very much. What I wanted to say is that maybe I would enjoy a book on history of something or, perhaps, a historical fiction book.

Just wondering what the best way to read the books is? Should I start off with the The Hobbit as this seems to be a prequel to the actual series? Or is it better to just read the triology without reading the hobbit?

Also, better to read books then watch the films or the other way around?

yl7wba,"""In medias res"" - Danger in the first line.","For a couple of years or more I have been researching novel writing.  This was partly due to the novels I was reading feeling ""cookie-cutter"" and not fresh or original.  I thought I would learn to write what I had been hoping to read.

Imagine my surprise when I discover that the reason everything is so uniform is mostly because of the gatekeepers. Editors and publishers won't allow anything through the front door that doesn't follow a format that feels safe to publish.  They'd rather not take a chance that it might be the next big thing if it's not following certain rules they've established.

I personally prefer seeing the peaceful status quo for a few lines then become rocked by conflict, either mild or wild. A set 'em up and knock 'em down approach.  Would The Hobbit starting with the line ""I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means... me!"" have been better than describing  a hobbit-hole and The Shire for a few paragraphs?

We don't get that anymore because of the adherence to the rule to grab the reader in the first sentence or lose them because we have a buisiness to run here! Even if you write a great opening line an editor can say ""Well that's not how our books work at Megalomaniac Publishing House, damn it!""

I have read the entire series about 20 times and they are as good in my adult years as when I was 9.  To this day the four books constitute my absolute, without question, put your hands down, favorite book(s) of all time.

The books themselves have gone through some awful wear and tear, and since they are something of a personal artifact to me, I would very much like to retire the cherished books from use.  So I need a new edition of the series.  I would love something more decorative or possibly with Tolkien's original artwork.  Also, something about the idea of reading the Hobbit to my children at bedtime makes me all warm, fuzzy, and giggly inside, so I'm willing to spring for a good quality edition.

If you’re a fan of Tolkien you should really experience this version.,"Hopefully this doesn’t get taken down for being promotional spam. I’m honestly just astounded by this listening experience and really wanted to share.

To reiterate, there is a free-to-listen theatrical audiobook of The Hobbit on YouTube by Bluefax. There’s music, sound effects, background voices, and the narrator is an absolute delight to listen to.

Growing up as a kid I had a hard time with Tolkien’s writing and I still struggle with reading his works to this day. In fact, I prefer the movies to the books because I struggled so much with them (yes, even The Hobbit. I know. It’s a controversial preference).

But I can hands down say that this audiobook has changed my mind. This is *the way* to experience this story (or re-experience it for many of you I hope). I’ve just finished listening to half of Chapter 14 where Smaug is slain and I’m literally out of breath and my heart is racing.

I was shocked by how little views these videos had. So I just wanted to let y’all know that this audiobook exists.

97f7ad,Just finished the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (spoilers),"To start off, a little context. Being in college, my desire to read on my own time decreases greatly due to the stress from assigned readings. I try to make up for that by reading a lot over the summer. Previous summers were not as fruitful because I could not find any motivation. Book reading felt more like a chore, and I needed to change that. Inspired by one of my friends' recommendations, I bought all 3 Lord of the Rings books and sat down to read them (I previously read The Hobbit and saw both film trilogies).

When I opened them up, I could not put them down. The worlds, races, and especially characters that Tolkien created were just breathtaking. His numerous details pushed me to imagine those worlds to have existed in reality. Sure, some of the songs were maybe too numerous (golly, can those hobbits sing!), but that made me appreciate what a creative writer and poet he was.

Though the images of the movies were in my mind while reading, they just made me appreciate the pacing and additional details that were not filmed. I was shocked to read how Saruman still survived at the end of the book, only to be killed at Frodo's home, where evil once had its roots. I also loved how the characters spent time in their environments, such as how Frodo sings at the Prancing Pony before he puts on the ring or when Merry and Pippin are in the home of the Ents. These small interactions, coupled with the great pacing that did not jump around every few pages, gave me a smile during and after the Quest of the Company of the Ring.

I implore you all to take a trip into Middle Earth and enjoy this wonderful trilogy of masterfully-crafted books. Tolkien has made me appreciate books again and I wish I could thank him.

My girlfriend's birthday is coming up, so I decided I want one of her gifts to be a J.R.R. Tolkien book she hasn't read yet. She has read and loves Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit. I know she bought the Silmarillion as an e-book, but hasn't read it yet.

avtcb5,"Hi Reddit! I’m Becky Chambers, author of The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (and other stuff). Ask me anything!","Hey, r/books! Thanks for inviting me back. It’s always fun to be here. Thanks, too, for choosing *The Long Way* as your book club pick this month. I hope you had a good time reading it (and if you didn’t, may whatever you read next be more your jam).

In a nutshell: I’m Becky, and I write science fiction. My Wayfarers series currently includes The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet*, *A Closed and Common Orbit*, and *Record of a Spaceborn Few*. I’m about to dive into writing the fourth book, so there’s more to come. I’m also part of the team behind *The Vela*, a digital serial novel produced by Serial Box and written by Yoon Ha Lee, Rivers Solomon, S.L. Huang, and myself (that’ll be out March 6). And late this summer, I’ve got a brand new standalone novella coming out. It’s called *To Be Taught, If Fortunate*, and I’m editing it...right now. I mean, not *right* right now, because I’m here with you, on Reddit. Right now in the general temporal sense.

I play games (both video and tabletop), I do astronomy outreach with my local club, and I love bugs. Ask me anything.

Almost forgot: [my website](https://www.otherscribbles.com/)

Proof: https://i.redd.it/1sqm2eihr5j21.jpg

**Edit:** I'm here! Let's do this. (Also my website isn't working right now, which I'll fix when not here.)

**Another edit:** So many awesome questions. You folks are the best. I have to go get some work done now (12:00 PST), but I'll come back around 5:00 PST to answer the leftovers. To be continued!

**Yet another edit:** It's not 5:00 yet, but I just stuck my head in to see how things were going, and HOLY CATS, you have questions! I'm going to jump back in now (3:45) so I can get to as many of you as possible, and I'll bounce out for good around 5:15-5:30.

**THE FINAL EDIT:** Whew! It's almost 6, and I'm afraid I have to get going. I'm sorry I didn't have time to answer everybody, but this book isn't going to edit itself.

x63hi3,The Children of Hurin by J.R.R. Tolkien,"So I guess with that Amazon show everyone is talking about Middle Earth again. I wanted to get back into this world through the books but was looking for something new and came across this book by J.R.R. Tolkien and edited by his son.

It's set in the same world although of a much earlier period in a different geographical location. Therefore it feels similar in some ways with many of the same races but different because of the geopolitics. Instead of Gondor you have Gondolin and instead of Sauron you have Morgoth etc.

I'm pleasantly surprised, I don't know how much is by father and how much is by son but regardless of whose work it is I am really enjoying it. It's not grand in scale like the 6 books that make up The Lord of the Rings but closer in length to The Hobbit. What sets it apart is that everything seems just darker because there is a lot of death. Not like in the other books where there is death only as a result of fighting between soldiers of good and evil. That exists in this book but in addition there is a great deal of tragic death for innocent people who are not soldiers. It makes the world feel more colder and I definitely got a stronger sense that humanity is being pushed towards extinction in this book than The Lord of the Rings.

It's nice to return to this world and enjoy a new story. I feel kind of sad reading this though because apart from collections of short stories, there's no new adventure in Middle Earth to discover so I am taking my time to savor this story but it is hard to put down. I wonder if maybe one day someone could come along and write additional tales but the chance of someone being able to pull that off well is low.

Anyway, I find it bizarre that I never really hear about this book. Maybe because it never got film adaptions, I've heard plenty of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit but never this. Or maybe it's because Christopher Tolkien helped and some people don't regard this as a true J.R.R. Tolkien book. I am not going to claim this book is the best book but it certainly is not bad and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to discover another good adventure in this world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/x63hi3/the_children_of_hurin_by_jrr_tolkien/,2022-09-05T01:32:58Z,39,139,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

3de98n,"So I am VERY late to the party on this one, but I just finished The Hobbit, hear me out...","So in the last few years I have been going back and reading all of those books I feel like I ""should"" have read, it's been a little hit and miss, but holy moly *The Hobbit* is fantastic! Dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, wizards, dragons, shape-shifters, treasure - this book really has it all! 

I have always been a little put off by *The Hobbit* because I read *The Lord of the Rings* over fifteen years ago as a teenager and I felt I was already pretty clued-in about the plot (I haven't seen the movies), but honestly the only thing that was familiar to me was how Bilbo came into possession of the ring. That, and it's supposed to be a children's book. Well, as a 30yr old I can say that I enjoyed it immensely, sure the prose itself is definitely not aimed at adults, but Tolkien certainly didn't talk down to his intended readers either. All in all a really great adventure story, so many ups and downs and nice dose of humour to boot. There's still plenty to enjoy and take away from this novel by people of all ages. A truly pleasantly surprising reading experience, I can't believe it's taken me this long! it makes me want to go back and re-read LotR all over again...

**One question**: Did Tolkien write Gollum's character without knowing his backstory beforehand, and then flesh it out later in LotR? There is a passage where he says he doesn't know his origin or what he is. Unless this is supposed to be taken as Bilbo's memoir, which I must say doesn't really work for me, the voice is too omniscient if that's the case.

wuwnvw,The Two Towers & The Return of the King - J.R.R. Tolkien,Went into lockdown in March of 2020 and decided to read “The Hobbit”. Turned out to be one of the best things I’ve ever read. Last summer I read “The Fellowship of the Ring” and felt it was great when it was great and a slog when it wasn’t. This summer I read “The Two Towers” and “The Return of the King” back to back. Wish I had something deeper to say than I loved these two books. Made it to the last page of “The Return of the King” and shed a single tear as I said goodbye to my friends. When I started the Lord of the Rings trilogy I felt like I was checking it off of a list. My fantasy reading journey began with a trip to The Dark Tower which is admittedly a weird start. I couldn’t be happier having completed LotR and upset with myself for wait until my 30’s to take the journey. I’d say I maybe comprehended 40% of what I read so I’m looking forward to giving this a re-read down the road.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wuwnvw/the_two_towers_the_return_of_the_king_jrr_tolkien/,2022-08-22T15:29:20Z,38,159,books,The Hobbit,POST,Fantasy

Another one was Angels & Demons. I'd re-read the book for German class a year before the movie came out, so I noticed lots of the small bits and pieces that were changed and it kinda ruined the movie.

pjjhrt,Movie vs Book: When has the movie fundamentally changed the character of a person or scene? (SPOILERS),"I just finished reading Fellowship of the Ring and I had some thoughts about it and the movie.  I was actually re-watching the trilogy when I hit pause and tried to finish that section in the book first, and slowly got through the whole thing.

SPOILERS, by the way...  SPOILERS ALL THE WAY THROUGH!

\>!It's not that scenes were missing or changed, which is inevitable and a lot of dialogue is directly lifted I noticed (very cool), but there were just some subtler changes that I felt took some of the magic out of this mystical Middle Earth and made it feel like, a piece of our own history.  Anyways, some of these differences are that, in the book:

\-Saruman accuses Gandalf of spending too much time studying and interacting with hobbits but in the movie he is curses the 'halfling's leaf' for Gandalf's foolishness 

\-At Elrond's council everyone is silent, unsure what to do, when Frodo stands up and declares he will take the ring (as opposed to bickering loudly, which never happens.  No one makes outright and petty arguments)

\-Bilbo stands up at the council and says 'okay I guess it's time for old Bilbo to finish the job...' and goes on and on for a while.  Boromir is about to laugh when he sees that everyone is paying respectful attention.  Only when Bilbo's said his piece is he informed he's probably too old and it's someone else's time.

\-When they're reaching Moria, Gandalf is talking about danger that's ahead.  Somewhere in there Merry is like ""well if it's so dangerous why didn't you tell us?  You'd better tell us everything right now.""  And Gandalf does without any backtalk.

\-Elrond says they have a great chance because the enemy has underestimated them.  He doesn't realize the power of men nor the power of the Shire.  He admits the Shire doesn't have obvious weaponry to fight but sincerely says they have 'power'.

\-when the fellowship leaves the forest (Lothlorien) with the breads and clothing, they're going down in the elf canoes until they meet Galadriel again who brings a bunch of food and they have a picnic on the shore because she didn't give them a real goodbye the first time.  

These are the things that come back to me because we have a Gandalf and an Elrond of immense age and wisdom, and power, who can interact with people born yesterday, relatively, and take criticism full on.  It happens many times that Frodo or a hobbit or someone is saying/implying ""Gandalf, what were you thinking"", and he just tells it.  They demonstrate why we want their perspective and not Sauron's, not because they side with men and not orcs, but because they have dominion over their ego.

I think this is a bit lost in the movie.  We're always wondering why are hobbits even on this journey, and in the end it seems they manage with faith and luck.  Why couldn't Aragorn have taken it? ...it wasn't made clear in relation to the book, at least to me, how much Elrond and Gandalf revere the hobbits for their ability to withstand the evil of the ring.  And not just them, but instead, in the film, I felt there was a lot of hidden condescension towards them.. 

This brings me to characters like Radagast and Bombadil who were missing from the movie.  Not a big deal but they represent, as Gandalf says of Radagast, beings of wide knowledge or power and yet innocent, completely innocent of the world.  In the movie I feel everyone, wizard, king, elf-lord, dark lord, everyone who attains to power becomes elitist in some minor way and exclusionary.  But Tolkien's world introduces us to characters who attain to the absolutely profound and yet remain a part of the earth like the day they were born.  Their humour isn't lost, their personality is still like honey.

Like, although Gandalf has his bouts of anger, he, Elrond, Galadriel, are such sweet people in the book whereas I can easily see how their movie versions could be offended and go ""How dare you say that in my presence ... bla bla"".  When Gandalf meets Saruman and sees the glint in his eye and the way he speaks it is so utterly obvious the man is evil, he's the only one of the good guys who's dismissive of swathes of people.  Even Legolas and Gimli become best friends. !<

Anyways, just my ideas on how a certain magical aspect of a book was lost in a movie.  Maybe it's subtle, maybe it's an illusion but did it happen for you that a movie missed out on the nature of a story or persons within?

efmacx,The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski,"Today I'm starting Sapkowski's series. I watched the first season of the Netflix Original series ""The Witcher"" and found out that it follows the events in the original book series. I've played the games and fall in love right away with the characters (especially Geralt of Rivia). I've heard opinions that the books series won't disappoint me. So here I am starting it. Toss a coin to your Last Wish.

Quick description:

Geralt is a Witcher, a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long training and a mysterious elixir, have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless assassin. Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack the innocent.

But not everything monstrous-looking is evil and not everything fair is good...and in every fairy tale there is a grain of truth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/efmacx/the_last_wish_by_andrzej_sapkowski/,2019-12-25T21:45:23Z,14,24,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
dxrj19,The Last Wish (The Witcher Series) by Andrzej Sapkowski,"So... I'm not immune to an intriguing trailer, especially if I have owned a copy of The Last Wish for a while now and just haven't gotten around to it. 

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the book. First off, the book was far more witty than I thought it was going to be (thanks Dandelion). I enjoyed the dark references to the well-known fairy tales. If I had known those references had been in there I probably would have put off reading the book for a little while as I finished Witches Abroad by Pratchett a couple days ago which was also chock-full of references to fairy tales. Granted Sapkowski's interpretation of the fairy tales was a bit darker than Pratchett's.  Which brings me to the other reason I actually quite liked the book, while it was dark it wasn't as dark as I thought it was going to be. Most of the stories did end on a (sort of) positive note. 

Geralt, while reserved and a bit cynical at times did honestly try really hard to get the best possible outcome for everyone involved in the situations. I guess I just really enjoyed the fact that we didn't get a whole growing-up, getting trained aspect of his life at the start of the book. We get dropped into the stage of his life where he knows that he doesn't want to be hero and will probably never be considered a hero. He is a bit cynical about humanity, which is understandable.  He doesn't fit in and people think the worst of him whenever they figure out he is a witcher. People generally prefer to be rid of him than have him around unless they want him to do something for them. While he knows that he didn't become cruel because of it. He seems to strive for the best outcome for everyone involved even if that outcome makes him look like the bad guy. At least that is how I read him. 

I also quite liked the way the book was put together. I've read short story collections before that focus on one character, but they sometimes feel a bit disjointed. I think The Last Wish did a very good job of tying all the stories together with the little parts at Melitele's temple that did a really good job of smoothing over the awkwardness of jumping from one story to the next. 

I doubt I was the only one to pick up the book due to the upcoming release of the Netflix series, so what did you think of it?

hvv75j,Review: The witcher: The last Wish," Hello dreamers  here is a review of the witcher: The last wish 🤗.  
This book is the first one from the serie, and it's combinated of 7 short stories that introduce to us The Witcher univers, and actually these stories were publiched in a Fantasy poland magasin in the 80s, then they got so popular so the author Andrzej Sapkowski, decided to collect them in one book.  


So in this post i will talk about The first story (Chapter): The Witcher, and each day starting from today i will post a summary of each one 😉 .  


▶️ **The Witcher:** Geralt is here in the kingdom of Vizimar to take a contract from King Foltest who has a quite controversial backstory, because he had commited incest with his blood sister, made her pregnant unfortunatly she and the unborn baby died during childburth and both have been burried in the same coffin.  


Seven years have passed, the corpse of the child has risen from the grave, brutaly killed many of the locals, she has been cursed, made into a Striga a dark malephic creature, then King Foltest asked Geralt (our witcher) not to kill her, because a wizard had told him that the Striga should be prevented to return to the coffin before sunrise then she could return into an ordinary little girl.  


▶️ Personally I find this chapitre interesting, Andrzej Sapkowski is getting us close to the witcher, making us learn more about his skills and techniques, and how uses his two swords, and items, he also gets us close to geralt's personality and how he differs from the other witchers whom has no sence of empathy whatsover.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hvv75j/review_the_witcher_the_last_wish/,2020-07-22T14:55:04Z,0,7,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
g2sfg0,"Thoughts about The Last Wish, first book of the The Witcher saga","Hi you all, I started the witcher saga with the first book and I love it. There's some thing I wanna discuss with u because like other books theres good and bad things. 
Good things:
I love the structure of the book, little past stories intercalated with a main plot. Very dynamic and the stories are, in general, interesting. 

If they don't present one major future character (Dandelion, Yennefer, the kingdom of Cinta...) They go deep in one of the aspects of Geralt and I found all of there stories are 'useful' to show us thing I consider could be important in a future. 

I found curious some of these stories are 'interpretation s' of famous European tales. 

Geralt is a strong main character with a good pinch of mistery. 

Bad things:
I don't think the prose of the writer are the best in the genre at all. I don't know if the translation has the fault of it (I'm Spanish) but I found the way of writing even confusing in some part (the action scenes which have more than 3 characters 'in stage') 

The women in the book. I'm a guy from 1996 and I grow up with shows like buffy the vampire Slayer and other shows with strong central (or secondary characters) I see some glinches here with Yennefer, the queen of Cintra, Ciri I think in the future... But in the first book the majority of female characters feel some type of attraction to Geralt (sexual mainly) Yes, I know is a book written in the 90s don't worry. 

And that's all.What do u think about it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g2sfg0/thoughts_about_the_last_wish_first_book_of_the/,2020-04-17T01:35:15Z,11,9,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
hyz491,The Witcher: The last wish Chapter 2,"Hello dreamers, here's another review from another chapter of The Witcher: The last wish. 

▶️The story begins when Geralt looks for a shorter path in a valley and notices birds circling a particular area in the nearby forest. He finds the dead bodies of a merchant and a young woman, and follows the path from where they probably came to a rundown mansion surrounded by a high wall and a gate. In the courtyard, Geralt notices a fountain with a dolphin statue in white stone, and a remarkable rose bush with indigo flowers. His attention is soon distracted by the sound of a rushing beast. Shortly afterwards, Geralt comes face to face with the current owner of the manor, Nivellen, who at first sight is more beast than man. The creature then invites our witcher in, where they dine and talk about his story, his father and grandfather, and their relationship and how he has spent the last twelve years cursed.

▶️ In this story we will know more about Geralt's charachter, through this conversation he had with Nivelllen we see what kind of men Geralt of Rivia is, what he thinks about monsters killing monsters and his rules when it comes to killing them.

▶️This chapter was one of my favorite, first because it reminds me of the tale Beauty and the Beast, secondly the conversation they had Geralt and Nivellen was full of emotions and deep beautifull thoughts; in this particular world people very often think that things are either black or white, there is nothing in between,a creature can be good or evil, and it's not necessary like that, it's more of specturn and there is a lot of shades of grey on it, and the big question is when it comes to monsters, where on the specturn do you place them and this is something that Geralt struggles with queit a lot.

When can observe him talking about this little more in this chapter, also this stories kind of raise a lot of questions about love and sacrifice, and what true love means, furthermore monsters actually can feel it and they can love care as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hyz491/the_witcher_the_last_wish_chapter_2/,2020-07-27T19:33:23Z,0,3,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

9ch39j,"What are your thoughts on the ""Hatchet"" series, by Gary Paulsen? Personally I loved them.","I just finished the 5th book, Brian's Hunt. Personally I loved the series. I wish there was a little more substance with the last book. It felt a little rushed and there could have been some more interaction with other characters. other than that I enjoyed them very much and finished all 5 in a week. Reviews on the series are pretty nuts.... 

some were very heavily critical saying that Paulsen shouldn't have written the series and left it as just Hatchet.  I disagree completely. What are r/books thoughts on the series?

1aiw0in,"What book(s) do you wish you could read again for the first time? Or, what book(s) do you wish to erase from your brain and never interact with again?","If I could read **Purple Hibiscus** by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie again, I would. Honestly, I would sell an organ to make that happen. This was one of those books I could not put down once I started it. It was beautiful, real, and heartbreaking in the best way possible. I read this as a sophomore in high school dealing with a lot of anxiety and I wish I could read it again now that I'm at a much better point in my life. Everytime I read it I go back to highschool me.

I also wish I could read **Goldfinch** by Donna Tartt again, but for completely different reasons. I never managed to read through it and it is truly a book that I cannot stand. I think it was so hard for me to get into because I was young and still stuck on Twilight when I tried to read it. The summary of the plot and the praise from other readers makes me wish I could pick it up as an adult like it was brand new.

Lastly on the list of things I wish I could read again for the first time is anything CoHo. I went in with really high expectations and was let down for every one of her books I've read. I like to pick them up from time to time because they're easy to read in one sitting and to give my mind a break, but I wish I could've given her books a fair shot without the constant internet hype in my ear.

On the flip side, something I would scrub from my brain and never deal with again if I could is **Statistical Reasoning for Everyday Life,** Pearson publishing. This caused more tears than my parent's divorce and two rough breakups!

I was so excited about it but was let down by the very repetitive writing and all of the annoying characters. I know there's a sequel, but I have no interest in it.

Another one would be The Starless Sea. I loved the first half, the writing was gorgeous, but the last third of the book was a drag to get through. The ending made no sense.

fzon2b,Just finished 'The House of Leaves' and the last 200 pages had me on the verge of an anxiety attack,"*major spoilers below*

So as a whole, I loved the book. I wish there was a little bit more of a concrete answer about the ending, but that's just my opinion. I know there are forums on the internet of people deciphering every minute detail, so to each their own. 

That being said, the last 200ish pages is some of the best writing I've ever read. It's strange because it's not like anything really happened, but that's what made it so anxiety provoking. Following Will's descent into the house, into nothingness, was so unsettling. And the way it's written really makes you feel as if you're feeling exactly what Will is feeling. You're flipping through these pages faster and faster, feeling like you're just on the brink of finding out about some tangible monster hidden in the house, only to find out it's just more nothingness. Then the part where he is sitting alone, reading the House of Leaves but has to burn the page he just read to read the next is beautifully haunting to me. This sense of acceptance of what is to follow after that last page has been burnt is melancholic but peaceful. Also, I loved how one of the footnotes was a claim by another author that the blue light he sees right before the film stops was Karen's flashlight. Not sure why, I just loved this detail. Really loved how Johnny's descent into madness at the end really mirrored what Navidson was going through - despair to acceptance. Amazing ending. 


That being said, what are some of your theories? I know this is a common one, but im of the theory that Pelafina wrote the House of Leaves as a way to cope with the fact that Johnny died soon after birth. The story at the end, Johnny says his friend from Seattle told him a story about a newborn child and her mother at the hospital. I believe that Pelafina really was institutionalized but it was because of the grief over Johnny dying as a newborn. Once in there, she created a whole imaginary life for her dead son. Also though, I don't know how Zampano ties in with her or if he even does at all. I have read a theory that Zampano is Johnny's father.

ez8e54,"After years of depression and not reading, I've read 3.5 books in the last 10 days.","And it feels so good. I forgot how much I love reading, how it felt. My imagination is more active than it's been in years and years, vivid images and scenes play out in my head like a movie. 

 I used to read constantly, every single day I'd be reading from when I woke up, during class, when I got home, at night. For 6 years, I have barely touched a book. I have so much time on my hands but I've wasted it with TV shows and movies and games which barely catch my interest. Just passing time.

 (edit: I don't mean that video games, tv and movies are a waste, I just have been watching garbage because I've already watched all the movies, shows and played all the games that I enjoy.) 

 About two weeks ago, I downloaded a reading app on my phone, got about 300 ebooks. Books I've wanted to read for years, every genre that I love, and got right into it.

I finished my first book, The Last Wish in three days, then I started the Long Walk, which I also finished in three days, then Annihilation which took me about a full day of reading.

These books made my imagination swirl and my heart felt tense, I was absolutely enamoured with how much I loved reading them. How intense they felt compared to movies and tv shows, it reminded me of why I loved books. 

Now I'm reading Paradox Bound, I opened the book and read for 8 hours straight, barely taking a break for food or water. I got about half way through the book in a single session, unable to put it down. I'm absolutely  loving it. It just gets better, the first few chapters I slogged through but once I got to a point where my interest catched, I was hooked and I cannot stop reading.

I've organized all my books, both physical and digital, I've created spreadsheets for Page Numbers, Read Order, Series Orders. I've set goals for myself. Every book I read, I'm writing a page long review for my favourite parts, my dislikes, the parts I hated. 

I'm still depressed but now I can read, so that makes it better :) 

All I want to do now is read more.

wajf8j,"I discovered a website that lets you read the first pages of random novels (if the opening has you hooked, you can click to reveal the title and author).","Link: https://recommendmeabook.com 


It is quite an interesting format, if you don't like the opening you are reading, then you can skip and go to the next book opening. If the opening does capture your attention you can click at the bottom to reveal the title and author. It reminds me of blind date books where bookstores will wrap a random book up in paper (to prevent the title and author from being seen) and will write brief descriptions about it. 


One of my criticisms, is that I wish the website would link to local bookstores instead of Amazon. Also, the library on the website is by no means complete, I noticed there are many books missing from it so I submitted some that I have read. But it should be noted that the website states, ""You may submit a book you like, or your own book, but as a disclaimer, we may not be able to add every book that has been submitted.""


So what do you guys think?


Edit 1: You can also browse by genre, by clicking on the gear icon at the bottom (between the two arrows). Just make sure you click save, then it will give you book openings related to the genre you selected.


Edit 2: ~~It seems the owner of Recommend Me A Book, might be inactive.~~ The last update the creator posted was in April 2020 on the website's Facebook page. I messaged them on Facebook and sent them an email letting them know that I submitted a few books and offered some feedback. I will be sure to let you guys know if they respond.


Edit 3: I was able to get in touch with the creator and they are adding new book submissions! But it will take a few days to get through all of them because there are hundreds of submissions!

k8wh8e,In Defense of the 'Slow Reader',"This comes up here pretty often. This sub is really good about making sure people remember that reading is supposed to be a thing you enjoy doing and that reading a ton of books in a short time is not necessarily a good thing. You're all great at acknowledging that it's great someone read a ton of books this month, and that it's great that someone FINALLY finished LOTR after 3 years of trying.

I'm the kind of person who reads really fast. I finally joined the unemployed party last month and have been ripping through books. The library has become my best friend. 

I wish I could read more slowly. I'm going through books so quickly that it doesn't seem likely that any of it is going to be retained. I'll finish a heady sentence and take the 3 seconds it takes to make the most basic connection possible and move on without really diving into the meat of what that concept implies, without exploring the possibilities of this new idea. I just let the narrator carry me along and generally take things at face value. The urge to know what happens next is too strong to pause.

1aclvuc,What’s the worst review you’ve ever left?,"I wish I could post a picture but I’ll copy and paste instead. The book was The Last Final Girl by Stephen Graham Jones and the review was on Audible. 

If I wanted to read a movie script, I would read a movie script. I wanted to read a book with prose and internal analysis. Writing the whole book like a script is an interesting idea but it gets old fast and it leads to several weaknesses in the writing.
The author is seemingly obsessed with overly sexualizing high school girls. The narration, adult men -including one girl's father- and the girls themselves all obsessively talk about their breasts. The story could work if told in a better way. If you must read this book do not choose the audiobook format. The narration is poor, the narrator is a bad match and he cannot do voices especially female voices. All and all don't waste your credit on this audiobook.

13svyv2,"Finished The Stand, don't get the ending criticism","I feel like the ending was perfectly telegraphed through the rest of the novel. Maybe my expectations colored this because I've heard so much disappointment about how the ""final showdown"" happens but I feel like the entire last third of the book was the final showdown with Flagg recieving L after L until Trashy brought the A-Bomb. Wish Larry, Glenn and Ralph didn't have to die but I appreciated their sacrifice, and how confident and at peace theywvere at the end--especially Larry. Great character. Speaking of great characters...

Tom Cullen is amazing, I love him to death. That's all there.

Ultimately, I feel terrible about Harold. So much potential and I wish that there was a possibility that Harold in some other life could have a second chance. 

Really happy I finally got around to reading The Stand. The most horrifying part to me is the sequence that flips around to the different survivors and how they all met their end, especially the one about the boy who ends up with a broken leg or legs in a ditch who dies of either exposure or starvation.

s3f4az,I just finished reading the Harry Potter books for the first time.,"15th of November 2021, i went into my local book shop and bought Harry Potter and the Philospher’s Stone. The reason why i got the book(s) is because of a of a promotion in my shopping centre due to the celebration of the aniversary of the Harry Potter movies and at first i watched the movies from the first one to the last(watched glimpses of it through the years on the TV but remembering the first movie quite well due to me having it on the cassette tape and watching it quite young) suprisingly enough i loved the movies and was saying/asking myself “why don’t i just buy the books and see if they are actually as good as people make them out to be?” i couldn’t even remember the last time i actually read a book as i’m more of a comic book reader then books.

Fast forward to the 14th of January 2022, 12:35am, talking about Harry Potter 24/7, posters of Harry Potter in my room, watching interviews and videos and searching about facts on Harry Potter, to get the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets game on the PS2 to getting the first edition books of the Harry Potter books, becoming a big fan of the books and even planning to go and experience the Harry Potter experience in London soon, i closed the book to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows with just a big smile on my face.

I haven’t been so devoted to any book/comic like this in such a while and can’t remember the last time i have been so obsessed with a franchise before. These books J.K Rowling have created are absolutely amazing pieces of work and honestly, these books will always be special to me no matter how old i grow. these books are just too great honestly, words can’t describe how i enjoyed these books. these books are absolutely stunning pieces of work and i don’t know if i ever get to experience a book like this ever again. just the amount of joy i had reading this book is unreal honestly.

again, i’m so glad i found a place and a community where so many people across the world love/enjoy Harry Potter as much as i do and i’m sure each every single one of you guys are just fantasying of being in Hogwarts right now. i honestly wish there was a Hogwarts but i’ll never stop dreaming and will always have the books so i can just go back whener i want!

again, without disturbing any of you guys day or wasting you guys time,  hoping you guys are having a wonderful day and you guys are wonderful people! never forget that:) please let me guys know how you feel about the books below or please ask any questions! would be much appeciated!

P.S… to Luna and Ron, if you guys ever see this, never ever change man:)

edit: i do feel like i have to read the books quite a few times as i feel like i might have read past a few important things in the books, but honestly apart from them, they were honestly enjoyable reads! i feel like these books will ever stay in my heart and i honestly adore so many of you guys stories of your experiences with the books! keep sharing your stories down below and please be nice and respectful  to other people down in the comments!:)

edit: it’s honestly amazing seeing the amount of amazing stories i’m reading from you guys down below about you guys experiences of reading the books. reading through all you guys comments makes me have a huge smile on my face and i’m sure there’s many stories left to share on your experiences with the book! i want you to let you guys know if i don’t get a chance to reply to your comments, please dm me about anything you want to discuss about your experiences of reading the books and the whole franchise! again wishing you guys a wonderful and amazing day!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/s3f4az/i_just_finished_reading_the_harry_potter_books/,2022-01-14T01:10:23Z,307,778,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
11fkja7,"Finally finished ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexandre Dumas, and I'm dying to talk about it"," I recently finished The Count of Monte Cristo and my goodness do I have some thoughts on it. It took me about five months to finish it but every second kept me engrossed. It started when I read a post here probably close to a year ago singing its praises, and immediately put it on my ever-growing 'to read' list. After getting it for my birthday last year, I finally sat down and started reading it in early September of 2022.

Coming from reading basically only non-fiction works, I was surprised by how this book *immediately* got me hooked. I fell in love with Edmond Dantes character, and his betrayal, loss and heartbreak genuinely affected me. I found myself so frustrated at his turmoil, and wanted nothing more than his revenge to be brutal and all encompassing. Seeing the fall from grace of this young, idealistic and just genuinely good hearted kid, into a cynical, mean-spirited and extravagant man was just something that made me feel emotions from words on a page I had never experienced previously.

Really the entire cast of characters Dumas created I found to be extremely compelling and interesting to read about. Off the top of my head there's Noirteir, the entire Danglars family, Andrea Cavalcanti, and Haydèe to name a few. And of course the titular Count was the star of the show every time he appeared on page. I found myself as in awe of him as were the people around him. His long drawn out plan of revenge was as fun to behold as it was impossible to predict. I do wish we could've heard about the aftermath of all the characters. I was particularly interested in what happened afterwards to more minor characters such as Andrea and Franz specifically. I felt as though their characters had quite a lot of build-up but were essentially forgotten about once they'd fulfilled their purpose to the Count. 

Other than that, the bit of a slog in the middle, and a few minor gripes (Didn't get the translation by Buss so apparently there were quite a few changes and removals made in my translation) I think this is quite possible my favorite book I've read. Certainly my longest read!

I'd love to hear everyone else's thoughts!

Edit: Also for all those wondering, I read the Barnes and Nobles bound leatherback edition.

I don't have a problem with most of the deaths because they have a true impact on the storyline, they're not killed without purpose, but one that I really disliked (mostly because it made me cry a lot) is Sirius Black.

Also, in the same note as Draco Malfoy, I wish the Malfoy family had a deeper story, rather than just make them be bad for the sake of it. Idk, maybe I'd make them turn to the good side in the last books, or make them be less classists from the start.

wqno4w,I’ve just finished rereading the Percy Jackson series as an adult. Here’s what it taught me.,"As an English major without much free time on my hands, I’ve spent the last few years reading mostly assigned literature; think your standard classics, with a few oddballs thrown in. And, don’t get me wrong, most are well deserving of their place on the shelves of history. However, I was starting to lose sight of the reason I was studying English in the first place, the reason I hope to teach it one day. I was starting to forget the magic. 

So, during my two weeks of down time, I picked up a book I haven’t thought about in over ten years: Percy Jackson and the Olympians, book one. The Lightning Thief. When I was in elementary school, the five short novels in this series were everything to me, along with your standard Harry Potter’s and LOTR’s (the latter of which I liked to pretend I could understand at such a young age). But, as I aged, I found my memory of them had all but disappeared. So I set off on a brief journey, back into the world of Rick Riordan, and was amazed at what I found. 

I spent the first few chapters in English major mode, picking apart errors in grammar, pacing, plot, etc. I forced myself to stop; these books were not written for me. They were written for a childhood version of myself, and he positively adored them. So I read on, becoming more and more engrossed in the story, simultaneously reliving moments of my youth that had attached themselves to specific passages or plot points. 

Five novels later, I was in tears. As I closed The Last Olympian, I felt incredibly sad that the story had ended, that I would be forced to retreat from this magical world of gods and monsters. And I felt myself wishing, hoping beyond hope, that perhaps the story was real after all. We all know the feeling. I hadn’t felt that sense of wonder in many years. 

My advice to you all: read children’s literature. It is the reason so many of us are passionate about reading in the first place, but it so often falls by the wayside as we age. The lessons within are invaluable. They teach us to view the world with empathy and wonder. They teach us to see the magic. 

Next time you’re in the library, do yourself a favor. Head for the children’s section, and find a book that tugs at the back of your memory, an old love long forgotten and dulled by time. Pick it up, sit down, and start reading.

z81fy2,Do you ever feel nostalgia for the time you used to read certain books?,"I've been rereading ""Harry Potter"" and I feel this strong nostalgia for when I first read the books at 12 years old (I'm in my late 20s) and it's crazy how vividly they evoke that period of my life. Like smelling a grandparent's cooking and remembering your childhood, or listening to a song that you used to listen during a certain event. I remember being under a blanket, snow outside, reading HP by the Christmas tree lights. I seem to remember whole periods much clearer based on the books I used to read during those periods.

And the crazy thing is I feel this way even for recent readings. I'll look at books I read, say, last month and I miss that time and wish I could relive that experience for the first time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/z81fy2/do_you_ever_feel_nostalgia_for_the_time_you_used/,2022-11-29T18:13:12Z,119,242,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
wp3xtm,The Lord of the Rings Trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien,"A book that me shed tears after a long time. I am gonna refer the whole trilogy as a single book to make it easier. It’s such a breathtaking piece of book. Had my sole focus on it for the past 1 week. I read it everywhere whenever I get the time to. Just finished the book today. The last few chapters of the part of the book has me still feeling melancholic. I really envy people who’d be reading these books for the first time. 

This book is such a moving piece of literature. I don’t even know how I slept on this book for all these years despite watching the movies. Can’t wait to see the extended version of the movies. The thoughts put on to the book by Tolkien is simply chef’s kiss. From the maps to the languages to the names and the poems. Wowwww just wowww. How could we ever imagine that this was just a bedtime story that expanded? Tolkien you mastermind. I wish he lived long enough to expand this fiction of a mythology more.

Once I read from this subreddit probably that Tolkien describes everything for pages . Respectfully Fuck You for whoever made that criticism. I loved every bit of the extra details it just made me feel like I was living in the book.

I wish the book gave me more closure.

Closures as in the case of Tom Bombadil. Who is he or what is he? 

Another closure is where are the Entwives and And and the world beyond middle earth. What world is that? And what happened of Sauron? Did he get killed when the buildings of Mordor crash and fall or did the King of West go and slay him?

Anyways lemme go and wallow in sadness. But if anyone ever reading this post go and read the LOTR if you’ve not yet read it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wp3xtm/the_lord_of_the_rings_trilogy_by_jrr_tolkien/,2022-08-15T16:26:57Z,119,298,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

126wywy,Just finished The Sword of Destiny (The Witcher #2),"Contains spoilers

God I loved it so much. Loved all the emotional and vulnerable moments of Geralt, a witcher who according to people of the witcher world isn't supposed to feel emotions.Him meeting his mother, hearing about what happened in Cintra, thinking that Ciri is most likely dead and then finally meeting her. I loved all of these moments so much.

Not sure how I feel about Yen in this book, sometimes I love her for showing Geralt that he can't just do whatever he wants and hop in and hop out of the relation whenever he wants but other times I hate her. How casually she says on his face that she cheated on him and sometimes down right insults him without feeling a bit sorry. I do believe they deserve each other though lol.

The saddest story was definitely 'A Little Sacrifice' for sure. Poor Essi, never got be truly loved and died a miserable death. I know she isn't a good match for Geralt but god it hurt to see her like that, desperate to be loved. I wish her story would have ended with her moving on and finding someone else.

It also showed a different side to Dandelion, a deeper version of him. He writes a poem about Geralt and Essi, sings it once and never again. No one heard it except the werewolf. And he was such a badass to carry Essi's body, not fearing the smallpox and giving her a proper burial with her lute and her necklace buried with her.

I can't wait for the mother-daughter relationship between Yen and Ciri. The Last wish is going to fulfilled, not as expected, but through destiny.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/126wywy/just_finished_the_sword_of_destiny_the_witcher_2/,2023-03-30T19:36:11Z,31,24,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
z1trk5,The Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts is the ultimate weapon against Anxiety.,"This book will always be on top of my other reads. My favorite part comes around Chapter 5. Here, Watts explained that the pursuit of security is in itself insecurity. I agree when he said that in a world where everything is forever changing and nothing is permanent, there is no point in pursuing safety. It’s like wanting to have food to eat everyday knowing that no food lasts forever.

If you haven’t read this yet, I highly suggest that you do especially if you’re the type to overthink things.

Favorite quote: You want to be happy, to forget yourself, and yet the more you try to forget yourself, the more you remember the self you want to forget. You want to escape from pain, but the more you struggle to escape, the more you inflame the agony. You are afraid and want to be brave, but the effort to be brave is fear trying to run away from itself.

It’s amazing how a 100-paged book could contain so much wisdom.

Will definitely read this again.




[EDIT] Didn't expect the post to blow up. I thought wrongly that only a few people were interested in the works of Watts.

To those who share the same enthusiasm and thinking of his works with me, I'm glad we met. And for those who think differently, your honesty is much appreciated.

A couple of hours since the post went live, I observed common feedback patterns and some threads seemed to have turned to a debate between the philosophical and psychological perspectives of anxiety. Specifically, clinical anxiety.

As much as I'd like to say something about this, I simply just can't. I don't know how the scientific method works. I'll leave this to those who can speak as they are acknowledged by the modern society, be it through their license or practice. The post is not for this matter.

Instead, I'll use the content of the book because it looks like from most comments that they have not read the book. Not to be condescending, but here are some of the ideas shared by Watts.

He talked about conventions. A more detailed Chapter 5 talks about a ""divided mind"" where humans have two concepts of themselves. In the book, these were ""I"" and ""me"". I is one's concept or idea of the self, which is tasked to improve me, the current self. He argued that it is because we were trained to use conventions that we became insecure.

Take money for example. It is what determines what you can and cannot have. So ""I"" would modify his identity to become rich and therefore make a better ""me"". This is where people start thinking they need to get rich and achieve all those worldly desires.

The food example was similar. We know for one thing that food makes people full, but it is not deterministic. What if one day you wake up with food but eating it does not satisfy your hunger at all? It just so happened that when humans ate, we became consistently full and nutritious. And what determined this conclusion? Science.

Watts proceeded with the argument that science is also a convention. Conclusions formed are ultimately thoughts of people, and thoughts are also conventions, something that we use just so we could come up with an understanding of things. But really, what does understanding mean?

In the modern world, conventions are evident more than it ever was in history. Things like graduate degrees, experiments. Those are things we came up with, because there needs to be a system. Because we need to rationalize. We need an explanation. We need something to trust.

But again, I am not saying nor do I want to that these conventions are totally useless. Because it makes life easier for us generally. Words, as conventions, help us convey thoughts. It's more convenient than doing a charade of your thoughts.

So that's where I stand on the discussion regarding this issue. To those who think that Watts is not someone that can help them, it's totally okay.

Finally, to you all: if you're feeling anxious, I am wishing nothing but the good things in life for you. Whatever it takes to live above your demons, may you have it in you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/z1trk5/the_wisdom_of_insecurity_by_alan_watts_is_the/,2022-11-22T13:36:05Z,400,5952,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
w8svyj,Just finished 'The midnight library' by Matt Haig,"I wish I had read it sooner. I started it last year but had to drop it because academics were getting really hard to manage. Anyway, as someone who daydreams more than one should about possible multiverse and the different kinds of lives I could be living had I made different choices, it was a book I didn't know I needed. I have made some mistakes, have some regrets and even though I'm currently living a good life I had hard time letting them go, this book gave me a better prespective and I can't be more thankful. 



I just finished it a while ago and I've been staring at walls ever since, smiling and feeling grateful and ready to 'live' this life I'm blessed with :)

5h1hik,Stephen King's The Stand... WOW!,"I just finished reading The Stand, well listening to it. I got it as my free book on Audible and have been listening to it in the car. I drive around a lot for work so I could listen for good long stretches at a time. 

Anyway, I found this book incredibly engrossing. There were many evenings when I found myself continuing the book once I'd got home from work. I started the book after reading 11/22/63 and The Shining and, I thought The Stand was so much better than the other King books and short stories I've read this year. It was just so epic. I enjoyed the references to Tolkien, it really fit. I'm happy I experienced this story. The characters and setting were so believable. [When characters died](/spoiler) I was always nearly holding back tears. AND THE ENDING! [It was a happy ending only bittersweet knowing the sacrifices the survivors endured. I wish I could keep knowing these people and learn what happens to them and the rest of the world after Flagg is defeated(?). I suppose I can read the other books Flagg is in? Are they just as good? I'll find out.](/spoiler)

There is one thing that's bothering me, the reason I decided to stop lurking and make a reddit account, [what happened to Joe/Leo? That child had been through so much but, the ending doesn't really explain what happens to him. Does he stay with Lucy in Boulder? Fran and Stu head back to Maine with baby Peter, staying only long enough to see Lucy birth twins. So is Joe/Leo ok?](/spoiler) 

Please excuse me if The Stand has been discussed to death here, I just wanted to share how much I enjoyed it. 

BRAVO STEPHEN, THE STAND WAS A GREAT BOOK!

One last question: Baby can you dig your man? 

Edit -  I'm enjoying the short stories in King's [Bazaar of Bad Dreams](http://i.imgur.com/urWutsS.jpg) but, I think I'm in need of something a bit more lighthearted. I think I'm going to reread my favorite trilogy in 5 books, HHGTTG. I'll read that while looking for the entire Dark Tower series, I already own The Gunslinger so that's a start!

It didn't take long for me to get into this world, especially with Peter Kenney's narration. One thing I like is how a large part of each story is simply two characters with different worldviews and experiences talking to each other. The dialogue is very well written.

I pretty much liked or loved every short story. Some took a little bit to get going but before long I was captivated! I'm looking forward to reading the novels and seeing how Andrzej Sapkowski does in long format writing.

I will say that I have watched two episodes of the show years ago. I enjoyed them, just never continued. I have heard though that overall the show fiddles with the books too much.

Well atleast Marie got a happy ending (couldn't even find out what happened to her afther though) and I am glad Etienne got to live and travel before dying, overcoming his fear of the outside world. 

The child Jutta was an interesting character, for some reason she saw right through it all, she understood the world even though she had been confided in a small town. She also becomes the voice of reason in Werner's head during his internal conflicts, and again I wish Werner could have met her sister one last time but alas, the world is not so merciful I guess.

Sapkowski 1st Witcher book was the last wish, which was just stories about the Witcher, Geralt, each chapter was different and not in any particular order. Sword of Destiny was the same, however, the last chapter is supposed to continue into the 3rd book titled, Blood of Elves. 

I took a break from the series to read The Satanic Bible which was interesting, but all in all, not what I was wanting in terms of writing; the book did cover a lot of interesting topics though.

sobf1m,Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood - A thought-provoking and haunting memoir of a girl who grows up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution,"Real sorrow has no mark as indelible as a conscious lightness in prose.

**Persepolis (#1 & #2)** is a graphic novel written and illustrated by Marjane Satrapi about her intense childhood and how the wool of innocence over her eyes is replaced by a sly and practical understanding of the world and human nature amid the backdrop of Islamic Revolution. For example: she could guess that her uncle/grandfather were probably dead and not on a 'vacation' as the adults seemed to proclaim.

These sorts of tragic instances are revealed with a tongue full of wit and haunts the reader all the more for it. Some scenes that left their mark on me:

>>!\-Her parents proved to be open-minded and had good perspective on things, earlier she is idealistic about her revolts and thought of her father's attitude as defeatist. Later when she finds out her friend's father was killed, she understands the reality of life. Her friend says, ""I wish my father were a coward and alive than dead and a hero)!<  
>  
>>!\-Her father's line to her mother who praises his sensitivity and acceptance of their daughter's blunt nature- ""How can I be insensitive to the woman I love?"" Another one of her father's- ""If hair is provocative on women, I should probably shave off my moustache too...""!<  
>  
>>!\-Her mother cleverly sews posters of a band inside father's coat so that they can smuggle them across borders- Posters of a band....!<  
>  
>>!\- When  Marjane's uncle told her tales of his time in jail, and used his jail last visitor to ask for a meeting her...just before he was executed!<  
>  
>>!\-Another uncle who had 3 heart attacks and couldn't fulfil his last wish to see his son because the fake passport maker was delayed.!<  
>  
>>!\- Marjane's writing letters for her household help and later being told that the social rank difference was insurmountable and she shouldn't meddle in affairs like these ones!<  
>  
>>!\- People's brainwashing in the hands of the authorities- imagine your kid goes to school and someone feeds him dreams of heaven in return for his life...and when you try to talk to your child, s/he is more interested in stuffing face with food rather than your lectures.!<  
>  
>>!\-The shocking torture techniques used- people flogged themselves, became masochists!<  
>  
>>!\- The absolute curtailment of freedom- no allowing for parties, simple things like music, wine, card games, social life. One mother abandoned her own child and the author loses all faith in things like 'motherly instincts'!<  
>  
>>!(This was balanced by hilarity when they emptied all wine down the toilet pot and then the father arrived, saying the police just needed few bills and he hoped the wine was still intact! Oops.)!<  
>  
>>!\-The scene where she steals a cigarette pack and smokes one in hiding and says, kissing that cigarette, I kissed my childhood away...!<  
>  
>>!\-The scene where she is out buying jewelry and her street is bombed, she hurries back in terror and finds that her parents are spared--oooof. ""No scream in the world could have relieved my suffering and fear""!<  
>  
>>!\- When she rebels at school, her mother asks her whether she wants to be executed like her uncle...and that virgins are not executed, so a guard will marry her, rape her, and then kill her.!<  
>  
>>!\-When she says goodbye to her parents as she departs for Vienna and says, saying goodbye is a little like death...she is 14 and realizes she won't live with her parents again.!<

The illustrations are minimalistic and poignant. It was an incredible experience to read this till here.

I will continue on with #3 & #4 now and highly recommend this work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sobf1m/persepolis_the_story_of_a_childhood_a/,2022-02-09T11:30:10Z,38,475,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

18hn3yf,Ending the year with one of the best books I’ve ever read: The Space Between Us,"I searched this sub and found almost zero posts on it so I just need to share: The Space Between Us is hands down one of the best books I’ve ever read. I just finished it last night, and out of the other 51 books I’ve read so far this year this one is going to stick with me the most. Thrity Umrigar writes in some of the most beautiful prose I’ve ever read and the story is so beautiful and devastating and original, I normally try to read books as fast as I can but I took my time on this one because reading it before bed was the highlight of my day for the last couple weeks. 

The basic plot revolves a very poor maid/servant named Bhima who works for a very wealthy woman in her home. Thrity actually wrote Bhima off of a real person, a real maid who worked in her home while she grew up. In the book, Bhima is actually very close to the woman and family she works with, but there’s a constant moral struggle because of their class difference. Each character is so humanized, even the ones who do terrible things, and the ending is one of the BEST endings I’ve ever read, down to the very last paragraph and sentence. It had some of the most powerful quotes I’ve ever read, I wish I had the book next to me so I could include some. 

And I just found out there’s a sequel that she wrote several years after this one came out, which gets even better reviews, so I had to pay for a new copy on Amazon because I honestly can’t wait long enough to find it at a used bookstore! Please read this book. Please.

wuwnvw,The Two Towers & The Return of the King - J.R.R. Tolkien,Went into lockdown in March of 2020 and decided to read “The Hobbit”. Turned out to be one of the best things I’ve ever read. Last summer I read “The Fellowship of the Ring” and felt it was great when it was great and a slog when it wasn’t. This summer I read “The Two Towers” and “The Return of the King” back to back. Wish I had something deeper to say than I loved these two books. Made it to the last page of “The Return of the King” and shed a single tear as I said goodbye to my friends. When I started the Lord of the Rings trilogy I felt like I was checking it off of a list. My fantasy reading journey began with a trip to The Dark Tower which is admittedly a weird start. I couldn’t be happier having completed LotR and upset with myself for wait until my 30’s to take the journey. I’d say I maybe comprehended 40% of what I read so I’m looking forward to giving this a re-read down the road.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wuwnvw/the_two_towers_the_return_of_the_king_jrr_tolkien/,2022-08-22T15:29:20Z,38,158,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

2vkitu,So I've recently finished the Dark Tower series...,"After a time lurking on r/books during which I was reading my own random assortment from the unread titles on my shelf, I browsed this sub for some ideas on what to read and gathered that The Dark Tower sounded like just what I'm into...and I wasn't mistaken.

I grabbed the first book in October and was absorbed in the series nonstop from that point. I devoured each one, reading in any spare time and staying up late to finish chapters. I think I read Song of Susannah in 3 or 4 days. When it came down to the seventh and final installment it was like I was on my own quest - neither my local library nor the one just north of me had it and I had to track it down after a bit of a drive, and it was worth it. 

I haven't been so engrossed and INVESTED in such an epic story since I was younger reading the Harry Potter books. The characters came to life for me and there were a few times at night I actually had dreams of gunslingers. The ending of the final book, I had to remove myself from the house (TV was on, parents talking) and finish it in peace, and once it was done, I didn't know what to do with myself. I was emotionally drained and felt like an era had ended. 

Anyway, thank you r/books for pointing me toward that story and more (I just started On The Road by Jack Kerouac). I think this is a cool community and I hope to be more active in sharing. 


EDIT: This blew up, and I'm glad for all your responses. Definitely a lot more displeasure with the way King ended the series than I knew (both the last few books, and the way book 7 wrapped up in particular). I totally dig that so many were disgruntled by the end. To answer some of the main questions folks have asked me:

What did I think of the ending? I was not as unhappy with it as many others were. I enjoyed all seven books, however forced/contrived King might have made it while under pressure to complete the series. As I replied to one user, it may have helped that I started recently. I probably had the revised(?) editions some people mentioned so it may have flowed better, and also I didn't have to wait years and years for the next book just to find a contrived twist later on. 

Have I read supplementary/related works? Nope, but I will now! I think I'll start with The Stand, and also search for the graphic novels which sound cool. I'm hoping to take a road trip to Canada in the not-too-distant future and will invest in audiobooks at that point too.

Thanks all for the discussion, and for bringing me to a new favorite! For those unhappy with the way it ended, I wish for you a fine new saga that will be everything you hope for. There'll be water if god wills it.

EDIT2: and thanks for all the additional reading suggestions! I've started a list.

utfypp,The Mistborn trilogy restored and enflamed my passion for reading,"*Just needed to write this out somewhere, this long appreciation rant.*

I haven't been an avid reader really ever, but I did read fairly regularly up until a few years ago. I tried to get myself to read some books I knew were good (from their reviews. awards, and the author's reputations), but I just could not get myself to actually get *hooked* on a story.

The last example of a book I've been trying to get myself to read (before Mistborn) had been American Gods. I was introduced to Gaiman's work through his co-authored book Good Omens with Pratchett - first watching the BBC series, then reading the novel. I loved both of them, and I bought American Gods after a friend recommended it to me.

When I started reading, it was intriguing. And yet, I had trouble staying focused when reading, and I never got past the first 30 or so pages. I was very interested in the story, and yet... it just felt like a chore to get myself to read it. I started believing that I just didn't like reading anymore, but I still kept trying to push myself to read.

Now, my life has been quite messy during this time frame too (still is, but less so right now). It was the reason I concluded I just didn't wanna read anymore - I could barely get myself to do schoolwork (the work I *had* to do), let alone any recreational activities.

Then I started thinking back to the last time when I had been hooked to a story - actually reading day and night, invested in the story. It had been the Harry Potter series, which I have not read until those very same few years. And I started thinking - what if I was just reading things I didn't wanna read right now?

It seems really silly now, looking back, that I didn't realise this before. Then again, I am not the smartest tool in the shed oftentimes anyway. So, I went and looked through my book wishing list. I knew I wanted a fantasy series - that much I was certain - and I've been eyeing the Mistborn series for quite some time. I took a gamble, bought the first book, and began to read.

It was the best decision I have made about anything, at least in the last few years. I was instantly hooked. I have read only the first trilogy as of now, but the first book remains my all-time favourite. It made such an impressive impact on me, and it made me so fucking happy, happier than I'd been in months, possibly more.

I didn't just *read* the book. I read it and *enjoyed the hell out of it*. Immensely. I carried the book with me everywhere, looking for small windows of time when I'd be able to read it. I made time to read it. And when I wasn't reading it, I thought about it constantly. I stayed up late to read some more, and when I awoke, it was the first thing I grabbed before I even got up to brush my teeth.

I just finished reading The Hero of Ages, and I was a crying mess. I wept like a small child, not just because of the story's developments, but because the trilogy was over, this long journey was over. And because of what this series offered me. Not a rekindling of passion. That flame had long been dead. This was an entire rebirth, entire restoration, of that passion, and creation of a flame greater than it ever was. I can't wait to read some more, both Mistborn and other stories.

13kcwj8,Late: Just finished The handmaid’s Tale,"I read The Testaments first lol and finally gave a crack at The Handmaid’s Tale. I did watch the show 3 season in and finished the last 2 after finishing the books. 

first Id like to say how happy I was to see direct quotes from the book in the show. I could easily see events and such and that was a great connection to have. 

Now, the book. I really didn’t like it and I wish I did. I honestly think Margaret Atwood’s writing isn’t for me. I found myself falling asleep several times due to the consistent and dragged out descriptions in every chapter. I felt like there was so much description (which I understood for the most part) but at times I wish there was more about when the changes shifted or i guess the details that the show was able to incorporate and dramatize. 

I think she’s an exceptional author i just felt like there was too much left to the unknown and that it went by rather quickly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13kcwj8/late_just_finished_the_handmaids_tale/,2023-05-17T20:20:17Z,16,11,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

p8c56e,"So, I just finished “Flowers In the Attic”...","I read this book expecting a fun horror/escape thriller. I guess it ticks some of those boxes (I wouldn’t call it fun), but not really in the cathartic way I assumed it would. I sort of want to hate this book, because it’s so disturbing, but I can’t help but be impressed by it. I’m not sure that I’ve ever wished more for terrible, predictable writing. There were plenty of moments that were intense enough, but the incredibly well-written characters amplified every unpleasant moment. There were several times that I decided it was too much and tried to put it down, but I just couldn’t stop reading until I saw the conclusion. I’m can’t remember the last time something has caused such a visceral reaction in me. I don’t think I’ll be reading the sequels, as I quite like the ambiguity that this book ends on. 

** Also, I’m still mad they didn’t kill anyone/burn the house down on their way out.

16ygwf3,The Stand by Stephen King,"It's a great book, the story is amazing, that last part in Las Vegas blew me away. Did NOT see that coming. I've learned to not expect too much from King's endings, but what happened in Vegas will never stop being amazing. Everything came together so perfectly.

The book up until the formation of the Free Zone was as tight and perfect as one could wish. But the Free Zone sorry to say is a drag. When the seven member committee gets together, I almost have to admit Harold Lauder has a point. Thankfully the baddies in Vegas more than make up for it. Every single baddie shined like a star from Lloyd Henreid and Trash to the mini-Elvis guy. 

I'm far more conflicted about the so called ""good"" guys. 

Take Nick Andros. So he f\*cks Julie whom he already suspected was not quite as old as she claimed to be, and then he physically assaults her over Pepto Bismal. Mind you even Lloyd Henreid the death row serial killer rat eating cannibal felon knew to stay away from Julie, while Nick not only slept with her but also threatened and abused her. And yes Julie's a b\*tch and bully, so leave her in that town by herself, don't talk to her. But to assault her after possibly committing statutory rape does not make what I call a good person.

And then Larry Underwood. He was abusive towards Rita, treated her as some kind of fuck toy. Woman was dying, had probably been dying for days, and all he could think about was somebody to f\*ck. This is after he shoots randomly in a dark tunnel and so wounding (and almost killing) her after verbally assaulting her over SHOES. Like if he was so smart and prepared, why didn't he think to bring a flashlight? If he had been less of a psychotic jerk over SHOES, he and Rita could have walked back to the city, got her the right shoes and maybe he would have remembered to get some flashlights for the tunnel.

The first third of the book was going somewhere. The last two thirds of the book were just endlessly repeating the same ideas with minor variations. Protagonists were all mostly flawless.

o9jpe4,(SPOILERS) what was the point of Lonesome Dove?,"Just finished it and it was an absolutely amazing work of literature.  But what was the point? 

Gus and call spent a decade or so just kinda spinning their wheels in lonesome dove and then mostly on a whim, Call decides he wants to make a dangerous 3000 mile journey to Montana.  Why? Was it just about having one last adventure? If so, what about all the pointless deaths that happened as a result of Call deciding to do this.

Him honoring Gus's last wish to be buried in texas is ridiculous and it was ridiculous of Gus to ask that of Call. So Call turns around and rides all the back to lonesome dove . The exact spot where he first started . He doesn't seem to have a desire to return to Montana, he seems emotionally incapable of having any kind of a relationship with his son. For all intents and purposes, nothing was gained and an awful lot was lost . He lost three best friends and a handful of men for nothing. Just to end up where it all began.

3wwp8f,The Problem of Susan [Reading Narnia as Adults],"It's fairly common for people to experience books differently at various stages of their lives. As C.S Lewis's Narnia series has been a children's classic for more than half a century, there's a good chance that most of us read the book in that particular stage. 

Re-reading the books as an adult (a year older than Susan in the LB) , it has been a very different experience to what I remember. My sympathies now lie with different characters, Aslan gains a slightly sinister edge, and the so called ""problem of Susan"" keeps playing on my mind. 

Anyone else with a similar experience? (Not limited to Narnia; comments about other children's ""classics"" welcome :)



Edit: 

From the LB: 
Susan is described as ""no longer a friend of Narnia"", and is ""interested in nothing now-a-days except nylons and lipstick and invitations."" 

Also ""she wasted all her school time wanting to be the age she is now, and she'll waste all the rest of her life trying to stay that age. Her whole idea is to race on to the silliest time of one's life as quick as she can and then stop there as long as she can.""

Full quote on Susan from The Last Battle [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3wwp8f/the_problem_of_susan_reading_narnia_as_adults/cy07gwy)

C.S Lewis: ""The books don't tell us what happened to Susan. She is left alive in this world at the end, having by then turned into a rather silly, conceited young woman. But there's plenty of time for her to mend and perhaps she will get to Aslan's country in the end... in her own way.""

Neil Gaiman wrote a compelling short story (2004) titled ""The Problem of Susan"". 

J.K.Rowling : ""There comes a point where Susan, who was the older girl, is lost to Narnia because she becomes interested in lipstick. She's become irreligious basically because she found sex. I have a big problem with that.""



Edit 2: Anyone have any theories on the role of Bacchus in the books? Especially if we go with the Christian allegory interpretation.


Lastly: Would you make it into Narnia (now)? 

Final Edit:

 Some people are asking for my interpretation (instead of just providing quotes). 

Reading Narnia as a child, I didn't quite realise the extent of the Christian allegory in the books. Sure, Aslan seemed to get more ominous in the later books, but apart from that, it was just a magical series about talking animals and a fantasy land that I wanted nothing more to escape into (and not get kicked out). 7 year old me hardly registered the problem of Susan, as I was so full of that childish self-righteousness that becomes harder and harder to maintain with age. Back then, it was easier to believe in good and evil in a binary sense, and have faith  in your own belief, if that makes any sense. When Susan was excluded(?)/turned her back on Narnia (?) in the final book, I took it as proof that she was in league with all the other older children and adults who had told me to put away the fantasy and pull my head out of the clouds. There was more than a hint of childish vindictiveness there as well, but I was secure in my justification. 

During a recent reread, adult me was more troubled when I picked up some of the things which have already been mentioned in the thread (the child soldiers, the dwarves)--and yes, the problem of Susan. Her whole family died, she is left alone in England with the guilt and repressed memories of a life she lived for 15 years. Don't you think that perhaps she had good reason for losing faith? After what seemed a lifetime in Narnia (with the Golden Age, etc)--to be stripped of that and then allowed back -- maybe it hurt her (Queen Susuan the Gentle) too much to continue to believe? Perhaps I'm projecting, perhaps the above is just my insecurities manifesting, but this is a problem I've always had with Christianity. All of us aren't created equal, go through differing experiences --so why should some divine authority expect the same standards from everyone? Call me ignorant, but being ""good"" comes with varying levels of difficulty. What happened to Susan just didn't seem fair; I just wish that Lewis had given the whole ""turn your back on Narnia"" thing more explanation. Lipsticks and nylons are weapons too, and after Susan was booted out of Narnia, England was the only world she had left? Who knows, maybe she joined SHIELD :)

*end rant*

Seriously though, I'm amazed at the level of response and the degree of discussion in this post. It seems as if most of us read the series at that certain stage of our lives, and though we grew up and made differing decisions, that impression will stay with us indefinitely. In that sense, the Narnia series is very special indeed. 

Not all of us will make it to Narnia, not all of us still want to go to Narnia, but part of being human is justifying our decisions. ""The road less travelled by"" is an attempt at justification, but what other options do we have?

After coming across a section yesterday that really made me think, I decided to google the author (he was recommended to me by a co worker) and finding out this is all made up totally took the wind out of my sails. I guess I can continue it and look at it as “great fiction” but there’s a huge difference between reading some amazing experience thinking it really happened and altered someone’s life verses going in knowing it’s all fiction.

mv92fd,Fellowship of The Ring is an amazing book and Tolkien is a great writer.,"I have alot to say about this book. 

First of all, the language is beautiful. There are so many long beautiful, poetic descriptions of the environment through which the characters journey through. Most readers complain that there is too much of description and that is boring. Well, I think it serves an important purpose. 

Firs reason: It helps to describe the world around them as they are making their way through it. Barrow Downs, Misty Mountains, Rivendell, Lothlorién and more. All of them are described in detail so as to develop the world of Middle Earth for the reader. 


Second reason: A huge, important part of the book is the journey these characters make through different regions and terrains. Now, when you're on this long and tiring journey, you won't exactly have it eventful all the time. You won't always be fighting Orcs, battling Goblins or falling into some troubles. Sure, that will happen and that does happen in the book. But for a good part, for any long journey, there are long stretches of...basically nothing. It gives you the feeling of being involved in something that is stretching for far too long and won't end any time soon. The character experience the overwhelming feeling of the huge journey. 


So how do you make the readers feel the same way? You focus the attention of the story away from the events to the long descriptions. When the attention is on long description, the plot takes a back seat and the whole narrative slows down almost to a stand still. When you read these paragraphs then, you get the feeling that you, yourself are involved in something that is long and a bit overwhelming. However, mind you. This is done in a controlled manner. It gives you that feeling of overwhelming in just the right perfect way while also keeping you immersed in the story. Don't get me wrong. Those descriptions are really beautiful. In fact, reading about Lothlorién made me wish I had been there. I didn't wish for the fellowship to leave that place. 

That is the mark of a great writer. 


The characters are really well written. I understand that most of them might not be complex. Some readers point that out. Heck, even George RR Martin also says this. But..then that comparison of LoTR with GoT it any other modern fantasy with complex characters is somewhat absurd. Because LoTR is meant to be an epic. Like Illiad or Odyssey or Ramayana. It is meant to be that classic good versus evil story. Tolkien says this himself. So why exactly do you want all that complexity shit in this story? Not every story has to been written in the same manner. 


And even if you do want complex characters, you have characters like Frodo, Sam and Gollum. Gollum's story is truly sad and depressing. He was a normal Hobbit who succumbed to the corruption of the ring. What he developed was basically a modern day equivalent of an addiction. 

Frodo is also well fleshed out. When Gandalf tells him about the Ring in the beginning, he gets angry at Bilbo for bringing such a huge danger to him. He never asked for it but yet he has been forced in it now. Throughout the journey, he feels compelled to put on the ring to save himself form the ring wraiths. Yet, at times he succeeds in resisting the temptation. Also, he is afraid and at the same time, he is fucking determined. Man, you really got to have some balls of steel to carry such a huge evil thing across such a long distance while evil forces are trying to pursue you. 


What can I say about Sam? I am guessing he is everyone's favourite. He is loyal, friendly, super cute and smart. In the end last chapter (The Breaking of the Fellowship), he panics when Frodo goes missing. He frantically searches for him in the woods. The rest of the fellowship also searched but it's Sam who figures out where Frodo might be. He has a panic attack but even in the midst of that, he stops, gains composure and tries to think straight. How cool is that?

jaoqtb,Am I the only one struggling to finish reading the Witcher Books?,"Ok y'all. I'm not hating, just hear me out. I fell in love with the first two books; The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny. The short story collection is a great way to introduce the world and it's characters.

Blood of Elves is where things started to go slightly downhill but I still loved it (particularly the first hundred pages with Triss and Ciri at Kaer Morhen)

But a Time of Contempt... Oh boy, this one's really difficult to read through. I'm forcing myself to get by.

Why?

My biggest issue would be that the author relies on dialog too much to carry the plot forward (as well as world building)  

I don't think too much dialog is an issue, just take a look at George R.R. Martin and his series, A Song of Ice and Fire. The dialog is sharp and smart, letting the reader get a gist of a character's personality. Like Tyrion Lannister.

A Time of Contempt? The same can't be said. The beginning has a conversation with Geralt and another character that goes on for about twenty pages. Twenty boring pages that hardly shares anything interesting and goes on about battles and history that, frankly, just aren't exciting. 

Whenever I seek out reviews for the books, wondering if other people share my same opinion, I only find praise and acclaim. So, I'm wondering, does anyone feel the same way about the Witcher Books?

10xnrkg,Project Hail Mary... Great book but worth the hype?,"I literally just finished reading Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir and I genuinely enjoyed it. I devoured the last 5 chapters of the book but I'm not sure I personally agree with all the hype the book got. Well, I agree with most of the hype it got but I still think that The Martian is better even if just slightly. r/52book and I'm guessing this sub thinks highly of this book some even going as far as calling it the best book theyve read recently and I can see why for me it's only second to Firestarter by Stephen King from the books I read this year. 

My issues with the book are mostly with Grace he's too much of a jokester for this type of story. It felt like Andy Weir tried to recreate Mark Watney from the Martian and just made a sillier version of him. I noticed that a lot of my complaints are based on the fact that I really enjoyed The Martian and had I not read it I would probably have enjoyed this book more. Watney had to do everything on his own while Grace had >!Rocky, I can't believe how much I cared for this fucking spider and at one point I kind wish he had died when we thought he had it would have been more impactful to me but In the end I'm glad he didn't!< And don't get me started on how much respect I lost for Grace when. I found out how he got on the ship. It also changed the basis of the friendship with his fellow astronauts. He claims they were his friends and that he was closed to them but as you go through the story you realize that just wasn't true. 

Anyways I know I'm nitpicking this was easily a great read and I genuinely enjoyed the ending even though I really >!wanted to see Grace return to earth and see how things ended up there I would even be down for a sequel!< I rate it 4 Stars maybe 4.5 but I'm not sure yet I have to live with it a bit longer.

17e2w3o,I finished the Dark Tower Serise by Stephen King,"Over the summer I was given a lend of the books and I also got some on audible as I found it was a great listening experience. 

I really enjoyed reading the afterwords by King and finding out some more detail about his feelings on the books, the audio narrators etc (for example the fact that he edited the first book at a later point, which was the version I read). 

So my thoughts I believe my least favourite were the first and the last books. I enjoyed King being featured to a point but the full amount of his character I did not always enjoy. I found it interesting that his own characters did not always like him though. 

I absolutely loved and was excited by the Salems lot cross over and the low men in yellow coats. Over the years I've read so many books and stories of his including UR so all the final links makes so much sense about multiple universes, it all clicked into place. 

I read a couple of reviews and I have to agree that the Mordrid vignette was a bit anticlimactic. I had wondered was Mordrid going to be linked more to IT, or that it would in fact be IT. 

I absolutely loved Oy and I was so sad at his death, I had wished he got to go back to Jake in his living form. It mentioned a version of him will get to turn up in the universe with Jake, Eddie and Sushanna but I wished it hadn't happened the way it did. 

Finally the ending, very trippy and I thought maybe as King himself says, it had to be this ending. The fact we have Ka and the Turtle it made me think of Karma and reincarnation from the Bhagwad Gita. He is being perpetually punished because he isn't fully capable of change. It also reminded me of the insanity in secrete window at the end for some reason but I'm not sure why, more the writing style, the idea of perpetual unfixable insanity than the character itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17e2w3o/i_finished_the_dark_tower_serise_by_stephen_king/,2023-10-22T20:47:23Z,9,14,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
yk791u,"Just Finished Steven King's The Stand - Struggling to ""love""","This is my first Stephen King book, and the longest book I've ever read. I'm not a ""horror"" fan so I've generally stayed away from his books, but I do love dystopian and apocalyptic novels.  This is always on those ""must read"" lists in those genres, so I bought the book and read it slowly over two months (four kids and a full time job will do that to you!)

My initial reactions - the first 300 or so pages went FAST. I loved it. The tunnel scene with Larry Underwood was chilling and felt very real.  I could palpate the fear, I felt like I was going through it myself. Very possibly one of my favorite scenes in the whole book.  Also loved the scene with Harold crying mowing the lawn, because it felt realistic and human.

Then we hit around 400-500 pages of DRAG.  It took me SO LONG to get through this part.  I pushed through, but it really took me like 6 weeks to get through these pages.  There were certainly good parts. I didn't hate any of it, honestly.  It just felt OK.  Mother Abigail and the scene with the weasels felt important.  The dinner with them all around the table, felt relieving.  But there was just something about journey, the travel... it felt too....something. Some of it felt pointless maybe?

Then the last 300 pages or so was ""pretty good."" I read it quicker, it felt like things were happening. But I wanted more of an ending.  More symbolism. More AHA.  The scene with Trashcan bringing the Abomb - he was FANTASTIC.  I enjoyed reading that part, the drama of the moment, of evil returning evil. But I wanted more from the main protagonists. I wanted Ralph and Glen and Larry to be MORE.  Glen, I actually liked his death. Maybe too short, but I liked that he died with no fear and truly taking a stand, reducing the dark man to nothing in his mind.  The other two I really wanted more from.  Their deaths felt listless and uninspired.  And traveling over the mountains with Stu felt overwritten.  And Frannies birth felt underwritten.

Overall, I liked the book. It wasn't bad. I enjoyed reading Steven Kings style.  I certainly didn't hate it and was glad I read it...but it just was kind of OK for me.  There were missed opportunities for elaboration and other areas that were overkill.  I wish I could read the edited version and see how it came together. Maybe I'd love it more then.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yk791u/just_finished_steven_kings_the_stand_struggling/,2022-11-02T14:49:43Z,120,114,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
kj195l,I really disliked the epilogue of A Thousand Boy Kisses by Tillie Cole and i’m wondering if anyone agrees.,"I recently finished reading the book and I absolutely loved it. But, I wish the book had ended on the last chapter with the memorial Rune put together in Poppy’s memory. I usually love epilogues but this one didn’t sit right with me. Maybe it’s because I don’t believe in the afterlife really and Im not a religious person but it just really upset me that Rune dies at such a young age and we don’t even know why or how. I think it’s great they reconnect in the afterlife but he was 27 or 28 when he died. I know Poppy was his soulmate but that doesn’t mean he still can’t be happy on earth. It just doesn’t make sense to me how that could be seen as an overall happy ending.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kj195l/i_really_disliked_the_epilogue_of_a_thousand_boy/,2020-12-23T21:02:54Z,54,98,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
192ofn0,The Books of Pellinor,"I have been revisiting series I read as a child over the past few years, and recently I picked up The Books of Pellinor quartet by Alison Croggon. I remember enjoying these books a lot when they came out and wanted to see if I still felt the same way.

I finished The Naming last week; I'm halfway through The Riddle, and I'm blown away by how well they have stood the test of time compared to other series I've reread.

Not only is Croggon's prose beautiful and crisp, but I find myself frequently looking up words I haven't heard of before. I love her wide vocabulary! I'm surprised I was able to grasp most of the story when I was younger. I'm also very invested in the relationship between Maerad and Cadvan, and I love how flawed both of them are.

A critique of the series has been that it's essentially ""The Lord of the Rings"" lite, but I'm personally finding this series much more accessible. (If you liked the rich descriptions of landscapes and magic systems in The Lord of the Rings, I'm sure you will enjoy this series, too.)

And, I plan to wrap all the books prior to watching the show, considering the Christmas is coming and have 3-4 more holidays in upcoming week.
Major Question : Anyone has read the series and wrapped the show ? ‘Cause somehow I’m resisting myself from watching it and I want to know,like, how many books are covered in the show

wko7jz,The Lady of the Lake,"So I recently finished the chronologically final novel in The Witcher series, The Lady of the Lake by Andrzej Sapowski. I know i'm probably a bit late to the party, but...ouch, the ending broke my heart and I felt like talking about it.

I'm not sure what I expected, but after five novels of build up, seven if you include The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny, it felt so bittersweet to just have Geralt and Yen die such...ignominious (not the best descriptor, but I can't think of a better one) deaths while Ciri is left to adventure off in other worlds. I'm glad she was able to master her abilities and go on to live a life of her choosing, but at the same time a part of me was hoping the three of them would've had more time to just...exist as a family.

That being said I can't criticise it too heavily. The ending did feel very fitting since The Witcher universe tends to feel quite bleak overall, and I do have a hard time imaging Geralt, Yen and Ciri in a functional, peaceful long-term family dynamic, but then again, that part probably would've been left to the imagination anyway. Still a great series over all, I really enjoyed it.

Now onto Season of Storms, though i'm kind of regretting not reading it first, since I know it's prequel-esqe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wko7jz/the_lady_of_the_lake/,2022-08-10T04:35:14Z,9,12,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

I loved the little references to pop culture, and Zachary and Kat are great characters - but I wish we could get to know more about Dorian (his true name, for example!)

15ljoqc,What am I missing in the secret history??,"I just finished the book this morning and I just can’t understand why I wasn’t a fan. I wasn’t a fan of any of the characters but I understand that was probably intentional on her part. But I also didn’t really like how she threw in supernatural aspects (edit: more so hinted at them) and then didn’t really do much with them? And what did the guy who fixes henry’s car really have to do with anything?

I thought Julian was going to be a much bigger part of the book but after the beginning we didn’t really hear anything about him. But apparently this pretentious teacher made such an impact that Richard considers him to be a father figure? 

Why is the school okay with a professor only teaching 6 students that he hand selects?? I just had so many  questions throughout the book that it took away from the experience a lot. I know Richard is supposed to be this passive guy who goes with the flow but after awhile I got sick of him having no real opinions or identity of his own (which again I understand is the point) but I just found it too unrealistic to have any actual meaning. 

I’m definitely in the minority here and wish I liked this book as much as other people! Will I like the Goldfinch any better? She’s clearly a good writer but I just didn’t like the story or characters of the secret history at all

Edit: I was also so curious about the background of how all the other characters (besides richard) initially became such a closed-off group of friends, and how Julian seemed to encourage it. I kept hoping to learn more about the other characters thoughts and motivations (especially Camilla) but other than henry and richard I still really don’t know anything about them. 

And if the group had always disliked bunny from the start (I did too) why were they all such good friends with him? Why tolerate all the racism and bigotry and horrible things he said and then blame it on him going through some sort of breakdown that she never further explains? I just couldn’t get into the mindset that anything about the characters was believable or useful or even interesting 

I guess I just didn’t fall into the atmosphere and vibes as much as others. Still wanna give her other books a chance though

c2krxb,Thoughts on the Earthsea Cycle?,"I’ve been a huge fan of this series for a long time, but I’m just now finishing the last book. I adore Ursula Le Guin. She’s my hero, I wish I could be anything even similar to her.

The first book is undoubtedly the best. But I feel like it’s hard to pick the best out of the sequels. Despite never being planned out as a series, each book builds on the last and leaves the story even better. 

The only one I didn’t love was Tales from Earthsea. But even then, I loved Dragonfly. Irian is such a great, powerful, unstoppable character. 

I wish more people were talking about this series. I’ve been making a bunch of my friends read it so they can join my Earthsea themed discord server, haha.

100o6ud,Notes From The Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.,"I read this book back in university around 2015 and remember enjoying it. Now, I am reading it again to refresh my memory and just wow.. it is so damn humanely relatable. I keep reading each page again and again just to make sure I don't have anything in common with this man but the bitterness... oh, the raw bitterness and constant reminders of brutal reality make me feel like I am him. A real paradox. I feel like my soul is being put into words. Damn it. So far the below excerpts have made me feel emotions. _x000D__x000D_

Chapter One, page 5: It was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to become spiteful, I did not know how to become anything; neither spiteful not kind, neither a rascal or an honest man, neither a hero or an insect._x000D__x000D_Chaptet Two, page 7: But, gentleman, whoever can pride himself on diseases and even swagger over them? Though, after all, everyone does do that. People pride themselves on their diseases, and I do, may be even more than anyone._x000D_
_x000D_
Chapter Two, page 8-page 9: I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment? I will explain: the enjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness of one's own degradation; it was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you could never become a different man; that even if time and faith were still to left you to change into something different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish to, even though would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into._x000D_

sdq8md,The Secret History: what did Henry whisper to Camilla?,"I usually lurk and I just finished the Secret History by Donna Tartt. I’m fixated on the last scene before the epilogue. All of the secrets between the 4 characters. The lies and love and regret. I cannot stop thinking about what Henry whispered to Camilla? I go back and forth between thinking he told her to forgive Charles and look or after him OR telling her to wait for him. What do you think!?!

It was probably the best book I’ve read and is going to be an annual re-read. The way Tartt described the winter at Hampden-I actually felt claustrophobic. I wish I could get a version from every other characters POV! Richard was the perfect narrator. He was omniscient because he was barely noticed by the group, but in his position as an outsider he was a confidant.

199j05z,Murder in the Family Review,"Finished it last week and must I saw wow! I will not summarize it, just give a few pointers and thoughts. Personally it was a good book, it is formatted like a tv script. Along with some pages with media such as articles, texts, emails and a similar forum to reddit. 

It was easy to read and I didnt want to put it down. It felt like I was watching the documentary series just in a book form. 

Although I did wish when having a character speak to also included their profession. (Example: Jane Doe Detective.) I found myself going back and forth on several occasions forgetting who does what. 

My initial thought was ITS ONE OF THE SISTERS. From the first text shown something seemed off, it was as if it was someone who was present in the house. But did I expect the 10 year old boy? Definitely not. Also the fact that the sister didnt even talk to each other they just assumed. (Well Maura assumed it was Amelie, while Amelie knew it was Guy). Especially if they are going to therapy I felt like as if it should have gotten brought up, but it being a traumatic event makes sense it was pushed under the rug. 

Luke Ryder also being someone completely different was something I did not expect. 

Nick was so unlikeable! A ""true"" producer who does not care about people's feelings and will do anything to get a shock value. No matter the cost.

Lastly, I felt as if the six experts being somehow connected to the case was a bit of an overkill. Although I do see how in the end it made it more interesting and added conflict to lead up to the big reveal. 

BONUS: That ending? Guy ends up overdosing on pills and his watch ends up on a grave waiting to be reclaimed... but what did that RANDOM piece of information of a nurse being able to administer a lethal dose have to do with it? A red head seen leaving? 

Overall 4/5, would recommend!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/199j05z/murder_in_the_family_review/,2024-01-18T05:50:41Z,1,6,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
1azbm7u,Just finished The Metamorphosis and I'm trying to organize my thoughts on it,"So I got it from the library today and literally just finished it a few minutes ago. It seems to be that kind of book that allows for many different interpretations. To be completely honest, as I sit and think about it, I find myself empathizing with Grete and Mrs. Samsa, probably because of my childhood experiences seeing my mother and my aunt care for my elderly grandma. Grete starts the book as a very protective and understanding sister, cleaning Gregor's room and trying to feed him what he likes, but it starts to take a toll on her and she doesn't want anyone else to assume that burden. It's pretty much what my aunt went through with my grandma, and I remember how tired and drained she always looked. The message about the strain of caregiving hit the hardest for me.

However, I empathize with Gregor as well. He obviously didn't choose to become a giant bug and, at least in the beginning, he tries to make things as easy for his family as they can be. He deserves to be cared for, especially after taking care of everyone for so long. It's natural to feel disgust at the sight of a human-sized beetle, but it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. It's clear that something breaks between him and his family after they try to remove his stuff from the room and the father injures him with an apple. He becomes way more apathetic and doesn't really care for people's feelings at that point, and I cannot judge him for it. The fact that the last thing he heard before his death was his beloved sister running to shut the door behind him and screaming ""finally"" was very disheartening.

The ending hit home for me. It hurt to read the last paragraphs and realize that, yeah, taking care of Gregor was, coldly and materialistically speaking, a burden. That they would have easier lives without him. Because it's true in real life too. Obviously no one wakes up in the body of a giant cockroach, but drug addiction, dementia, Alzheimer's, terminal cancer or any severe illness can be life altering and completely debilitate someone. Realizing that your family would technically be better off without you... I can't even imagine the pain of that. And catching yourself having these thoughts about your sick family member is really scary (if you love and care about them). Obviously Grete goes a tad too far in wishing aloud that Gregor died, but I've had intrusive thoughts like this quite a few times before. Preserving family relationships in such a painful context requires a lot of maturity, openness and love, which definitely lacked in the Samsa household - in part because Gregor couldn't speak, and in part because they didn't make that big of an effort to try and communicate with him.

They did their best, I believe (except the father, he was pretty much an asshole from the jump), and they all came across as very human to me. In the end, it's nobody's fault.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1azbm7u/just_finished_the_metamorphosis_and_im_trying_to/,2024-02-25T01:33:52Z,16,57,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

Because of several conditions I order all of my books online and they take around two weeks to arrive. Anyway. Seeing as I liked the witcher games and that I love reading I decided to read the books. So without doing research I just went and ordered what was labeled the first book in the series. Blood of Elves. The book arrived today and only now did I find out that actually there is a book before this one called the last wish. The thing I need to know is that is it necessary to read the last wish before starting on the blood of elves or can I skip it and read it later.

oyhhpn,Blood Meridian or The Evening Redness in the West,"I google searched ""Blood Meridian reddit"" and saw page after page of reddit posts related to this book, so I am sure that there is nothing that hasn't been discussed, but I finished this novel for the first time last night (my first Cormac McCarthy novel) and I cannot stop thinking about it. It has been a long time since a novel has completely floored me. I spent the rest of the evening looking up articles, blogs, essays, videos about this book. I needed to know everything about what I just read. I needed to understand why this book exists. 

I have this vivid image in my head of the Judge dancing around singing ""I'm never gonna sleep. I'm never gonna die."" that won't leave my head. I wish I was artistic enough to put this image to paper. Of course there are many other scenes that occupy my nightmares, but those final pages left me exhausted. The very embodiment of evil dancing and singing and there isn't single thing that will stop him. Evil will never sleep. Evil will never die. 

This will probably be annual re-read from now on. 

I do not usually post on reddit and I don't expect this will spark much conversation with how many posts flood this subreddit each day, but I just needed some place to spill my horrified love for this book since nobody that I know personally has read it.

1713awe,Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was Spectacular; the Pentology? Not so much...,"I finally hit the point today where I decided to drop reading 'Foundation and Earth', and felt the need to make a post to see if anyone shared my feelings about this book.

The original 3 books of Isaac Asimov's foundation series (Foundation, Foundation's Empire, Second Foundation) are among my favourites. They are a compilation of short stories exploring the organic evolution of a society/organization built around offsetting humanity's greatest dark age after the fall of a galactic empire.

The format these stories helps with their enjoyment greatly. Each story helped to set up logical, worldbuilding consequences of where the last story left off, and chronicle a natural evolution of societal institutions and how they would lead to the reemergence of a post-dark age society. 

While they introduced new characters and their struggles against the institutions that were failing their specific eras, the real fun was in seeing how each individual crisis was solved through the clever thinking of the viewpoint character.

Each of these stories was meant to represent such logical progressions in patterns of history, that it was capable of being predicted for well in advance by the mathematics of a pseudo-messiah.

While not necessarily a hard sci-fi, until the crisis of the last book, which involves an unaccounted for anomaly in the form of ESP, the series is pretty grounded in realistic worldbuilding. 

The fundamental pretense of being about to predict history in advance via mathematics may require a suspension of belief, but I could defend that with enough historical records and meticulous advances in social sciences, it isn't impossible to form a unifying theory of group behaviour that could be contingent on statistical probabilities.

The last two books (Foundation's Edge, and Foundation and Earth), written far later in Asimov's career (and as told in the forward of the former, for a boatload of cash) followed a different format. They were long-form narratives following two (later three) specific characters, as they journeyed across a series of locales in their investigative work, first to hunt down a conspiracy affecting the new galactic government, and then later to find Earth, as it remained a loose end in the viewpoint character's mind.

Foundation's Edge was good, not great. Part of it is a story of two diametrically opposed social institutions being forced into battle with one another, and ultimately falling prey to a wildcard third one. The third institution is somewhat contrived, but the story still had some interesting intrigue.

They also introduce a character who feels a little too ""male fantasy"" for my liking. A psychic hivemind woman who's primary descriptions and actions imply that she is very attractive, who exclusively (and suspiciously) is romantically compelled by the somewhat elderly, professor character. I don't wish to say this is unrealistic or unfeasible, but part of this felt a little too much like a self-insert ""getting the babe"" for my liking.

The story also leans further into ESP, though does so in a way that is at least fascinating. The form which the hivemind takes was different than most other media depictions (like the Borg, Zerg, etc...), and so it was at least intellectually interesting. This drifted the story away from the grounded worldbuilding I spoke about prior, but at least it had something going for it.

There is a conclusive end to the series here, in the form of a decision the main character is forced to make about which institution to rule the galaxy. I find the forced decision contrived as an end for a series about the natural progression of history, and felt a little more like how I would expect a ""choices matter"" videogame to conclude.

Which brings me to Foundation and Earth. I forced myself through two fifths of this novel, and I have finally just given up and read a summary of the rest. 

The inciting incident is weak. It was merely that the main character had an 'intuitive feeling' that there is something important on Earth. The rational being that it is still a mystery to him, the other characters, and the historical record. 

The format of the story is largely the just moving from planet to planet while the protagonists try to gather clues on the location of Earth.

This 'episodic' format isn't necessarily bad, but it is missing the kind of lore that made me fall in love with the original trilogy. 

Where I finally got sick of this series was when they go to a specific planet with a lot of sexual repression. The main character ends up being detained by a woman who appears to be a Spartan-like bureaucrat, but the conflict is resolved with hot, freaky sex. 

Hot freaky sex without nuance too, I might add. Most of the viewpoint character's thoughts are about how rockin' that bod is for an older lady, and more serious psychological exploration into this situation never really comes about.

Despite having deep respect for Asimov's work, and for his impact on culture at large, when I got to this point in the book, I felt like I was reading the work of pervy old man who was untouchable by his editors.

I tried reading past this point, but after a few more pages of what felt like maid-and-butler dialogue, I finally decided that this is too much fluff when I have many other books to read, and just gave up.

Despite my stern dislike of this last book, and my general qualms with the previous one, I haven't seen many opinions online which have shared my viewpoint.

With two other serialized sci-fi series that I love (Dune, and Ender's Game), there are very strong opinions about where to stop reading the series. Yet I have seen much less discourse on the matter about the Foundation Series.

I'm curious as to other people's insights on the series.  Did I miss out on any really interesting pieces on dropping where I did (including skipping the prequels), or did I miss a general consensus to finish after the third book?

15bajl3,Franz Kafka's The Castle should've never been published. (Spoilers),"**The Castle, by Franz Kafka**

In a search I found:

Upon his (Kafka's) death in 1924, Kafka instructed his literary executor, Max Brod, to destroy all his manuscripts. Wisely refusing his friend's last wishes, Brod edited the uncompleted Castle, along with other unfinished works, ordering the fragments into a coherent whole, and had them published.

After finishing the book, I now see why Kafka wanted it destroyed. 

The book starts out good, but falls flat in the middle. There's no resolution in the end, but you kind of expect that with an unfinished novel. I never read a book with so much fluff in it. There's 5 or 6 chapters on the dialogue at Barnabas's house between K. and Barnabas's sisters, Olga and Amalia; these chapters should've been condensed into one. The conversations are circular, and not in a good way (it'd be nice if they were intended to make one dizzy, and written in such a clever way, but they're not.) It's repetition. The dialogue is so long and so repetitive, you forget who's talking. The paragraphs are never ending, and are not broken up between the characters' dialogue (with lengthy dialogue like this, new paragraphs would've worked out better.)

I understand the meaning and take away from the novel. I see that the closer K. tries to get to the villagers, the further away they push him. I understand the theme of alienation. I even think the alienation goes further in that we, the reader don't know if K. is who he claims to be. (Even the landlady scene at the end states that neither K. nor herself are who they claim to be.) I seen others' discussion where the abbreviation of the protagonist designates the character is of a different ethnicity than those in the surrounding village of the Castle, which reflects Kafka's own struggles as a German-speaking Jew in Germany. So, I grasp the understanding, and I did get something from the book, but I struggled to finish it, and I almost DNFed it, which is rare for me.

I really wanted to like this book, and by the ratings, I thought for sure I would. Did anyone else experience the same or similar feelings in regard to this book. Was this book just published for Max Brod's financial greed?

bq57bu,"This is the worst book I've ever read, and it's being praised like no other. Is it me?","^(Edit, disclaimer: I don't hate the book, and I'm happy for the author that she got published, and I'm also happy there are others who do enjoy it. There's not a shred of resentment in me; only confusion.)


_Dear Friend, From My Life I Write To You In Your Life_ is the most empty thing I've ever read, and it's being praised as if it's another one of Camus'. It pisses me off to no end, because although it starts off very strongly, and although its prose is of quite a pleasant nature, the second page in it deteriorates into pseudo-philosophy, asking questions and raising topics that aren't further discussed, making it seem like all the critics only read the first page and judged it fantastic. It feels like the guy at the dinner table quoting Camus when asked what he'd like to drink, if that makes any sense.


I want to know your thoughts on the matter to figure out if it's just me.


The book begins with twenty four short, numbered paragraphs of which the topics swing about with no resolutions whatsoever. I'm talking tweet-sized sections here, so there's no time to think, alright? Just get in, loser, because we're going fast. 


Number one: MC is reminiscing on the first time she saw before-and-after photos after migrating to America, and she reflects on how definitive this concept seems—as if there's a clear distinction between what one was and what one is, and that therefore there is the possibility of leaving past mistakes behind. A stellar analogy by the author, and a cast iron ground for what seems to promise a great work of literature. 


Nope. 


Paragraph two cuts in without any further mention of the above: an acquaintance called, MC's husband met the woman, he brought her to the airport, and two weeks later the woman had jumped out of a window. MC doesn't visit the funeral.


Okay.


""Our memories tell more about now than then,"" MC continues right after, god knows why, and as if this is something about which everyone is in unison. ""Doubtless the past is real,"" she then proclaims. Over two millennia of philosophy settled right then and there, ladies and gentlemen. 


Paragraph three: past, present, and future are not one and the same MC explains. Roger. 


Paragraph four. MC is staying at a hospital for the second time. The first isn't mentioned, because why would it? MC then channels a bit of Freddie in telling that she too at times wishes not to have ever been born. Being alone in her thoughts, she then feels a 'collective sigh': her tears seemed to prove something. 


What on earth is a collective sigh in the first place, and how on earth can she experience one when she's precisely alone in a basement room? Her words, mind you; not mine!


But forget about all of this, because paragraph five, and everyone in MC's life apparently wonders what she's hiding: her mother, a bathhouse employee, and apparently that makes up everyone MC knows. If you're now wondering where the hell this is coming from, then welcome to the club: why would people think this; why would they ask this; why are we told about this? 


Next! Number six makes sure we're aware that there are five time zones in China—MC's country of birth—and that the whole nation uses one, unified zone. She reflects that time is ingrained in all our experiences and memories, and wonders how many of us have ever wished to have had a bit more time... The ellipse is not my addition. 


I could go on and on, but I'll spare you the other eighteen tweets, along with all the unfinished thoughts, philosophically interesting but otherwise out of place questions that are never actually further reflected upon, shallow references to Dostoevsky with no further weight to them, abruptly ended paragraphs, frequently strange and sometimes flawed interpunction, and at times even unfinished sentences. I wish I was being hyperbolic with that last one, but I'm not. I quote: ""Your roommate, several women said to me, eyeing her torn paper gown and oblivious half-nakedness when she moved about in the hallway, where we all sat on sofas or chairs, socializing as we had been encouraged to do."" What about this roommate? Why did these women bring her up? Now, you might think that perhaps the period was meant to be a comma and that what is now the next sentence would then have finished the first. That's very sharp of you, and very charitable, because nope: next paragraph. 


I shit you not; that actually happened: an unfinished sentence that raised several questions was the last sentence of a fucking paragraph. 


Please, for the love of literatue, can someone helpe out here? This book with a phenomenal title, a fantastic first page, and oftentimes even prose that makes me envious in ways I've rarely felt before—this book has won The Guardian's First Book Award, despite all of the above. 


And mind you: this is all only thirty pages in, and that with a font size that overly respects the far-sighted.

t1l24b,I just finished “Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea” and I have mixed emotions about it.,"On the one hand, the writing is gorgeous and all the descriptions are phenomenal.  It manages to be a relevant and interesting science fiction novel some 120 years later.  The ideas present in it are so fascinating and a joy to read

But on the other hand, it can be very slow, especially at the beginning of the second part.  I really hoped that just a little more would be given away about the Nautilus and it’s backstory, I like the unanswered mystery if it all, but I wish it went a little further.

I found the last chapter a little anti-climatic, I wish that more was shown, as the “and then we woke up in a cabin.  Don’t know how we got there” felt really disappointing.  Especially when you think of how well Verne built up tension between the characters through the whole book.  

Was it just me who found this annoying? :|",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/t1l24b/i_just_finished_twenty_thousand_leagues_under_the/,2022-02-26T02:04:29Z,9,7,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
1bgyfhp,Finishing “Tender is the flesh”: thoughts,"Thank you to all the lovely people who discussed with and warned me of the worst bits in my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/books/s/FjJa1pFA7b

I finally finished the book and it has me feeling all sorts of ways; pissed off because there was hope there for a second (but as another clever redditor pointed out, it was false all along), sad for the characters on both sides suspended in continuous helpless agony, whether mental or physical, but most of all actually kind of scared because the process of legitimizing atrocities on shaky grounds has and no doubt will happen again. And all most of us can do is find some sort of semi-stable line to toe to be able to bear it all. 

I’m not sure if I think the book is more of a bleak view on the meat industry, the way society can turn on itself for preservation of the status qou or both, and my own love for meat sure took a hit, especially when I coincidentally found myself eating actual cow’s tongue (which is a delicacy in my culture, don’t shoot me) while reading the part on the hunter’s dinner party, but regardless of what evil is being dissected, it is portrayed well and in a stark, unforgiving light. 

To me, this book reads primarily as a story of loss and it’s sometimes dehumanizing consequences on both a tiny and a grand scale. I understand why the characters do what they do and except for Mari (who reads as an archetype of the old generation who acts is if she has no finger in the game yet clutches her pearls and goes completely hysterical every time a consequence of her own time rears it’s ugly head), I somewhat empathize with their chosen paths however dark they may be. It makes sense in the context of the story and I appreciate how Bazterrica doesn’t compromise on or try to redeem any of the storylines along the way. 

I would however wish that more time was spent on an eagle’s eye view of the society and different castes within it, and I would love to read more stories from the same universe, how it came to be as it is. 

With that said, this book is still in my top 3 most disgusting reads of all time and I would not recommend it freely or read it again. And as for the last sentence; should we really have expected anything else?

Last I remember, at the end of As Yet Unsent, Blood of Eden was carrying her body around. I don’t recall any kind of scene where the emperor steals it back, but maybe I missed something? 

I really wish we got to see the last six months of Gideon/Kiriona’s life(?). Was it just me, or did she not seem like the same Gideon we know and love from the first two books? I get that being thrust back into your body and hanging around a couple sociopathic, narcissistic necromancers probably impacts you to some degree, but she just felt so different.

18o7vew,[Spoilers] I just finished the Wolf Den Trilogy,"**This thread contains spoilers for the entire series.**



I’m about to get my life back after having my nose in this world for the last three days, and I wanted to share some thoughts and hear yours in return. I know that the book has been discussed here before so I hope it’s alright. I just want to reach more people to talk about the series with.



—-


- The destruction of Pompeii and surrounding areas still hit me way more than I would’ve expected, even though I obviously knew it was coming. This part was written really well.



- I wish that we could get more background story on some of the characters. I thought Paris was very interesting cause he’d grown up in the Lupenara, and I thought it was pretty heartbreaking how the story ended with him and Fabia both. I would totally read a book just about Fabia raising Paris in that place.



- I honestly thought the quality of the writing was a bit inconsistent. Sometimes I thought it was good and nicely paced but other times it was bland and it felt like the author held back a lot. I wish that the book series “boomed” a little more at times, and not just by people raising their voices in the dialogue.



- I stumbled upon [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtefactPorn/comments/sqd3zr/a_roman_gold_snake_bracelet_found_on_the_arm_of_a/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=books&utm_content=t1_keee5ws). This is the same bracelet that Drusilla’s character wore. I was sad when I found this, cause it must mean that she died :(. 



- Some of the characters were really well done, for instance Rufus.  I came to despise this character so much. He was written with just enough depth, and very believable for a rich prick who is used to stepping on poor people all his life. I like how through him, we see that a brothel slave is always powerless against a client, even ome who first appears like a kid in love. 



- I liked Brittanica a lot! She was a bit of a cartoon barbarian at times but I liked it and was relieved that she survived. Every time she appeared in books 2 and 3, I felt a sense of safety just like Amara did with her, because I could really feel the strength and loyalty of that character.



- The ending is pretty fulfilling. I wonder about what actually happened to the enslaved people that lived in Pompeii. Did they break free? I was sad that pretty much no one seems to have survived that we got to know in the book.



- At times the book was a little anachronistic, and I prefer it when writer of Roman fiction use more Latin for the sake of immersion. Dominus instead of master, insulae instead of flat or apartments. But that’s just personal preference and can be a bit annoying if overdone.

3fbzrl,"I'm jobless. I'm disabled. I'm living with my parents. I had a sudden urge to read, but I have no money. Then I thought to myself, ""The library!""","Libraries were made for people like me.  

I've suffered with severe depression for the last 4 years.  I've found jobs, but haven't been able to hold on to them.  I decided to get treatment 2 years ago and now I'm finally seeing some improvement.

Depression takes something dear away from you.  The ability to enjoy the things you've loved.  I love books.  I loved reading.  I couldn't experience that for a long time.  Thanks to the treatment, I can now.

At first I was bummed out.  I had no money to buy a book.  There's no way I was going to ask my mom for it, because she's given me enough already.  I was in this state for a few days until it dawned on me.  The library!!!!  I couldn't believe I had forgotten about it.

I know there's been some talk about phasing out libraries because books are ancient technology.  We have access to so much information on the internet that libraries are simply unnecessary.  Not only that, but consumerism for books is at an all time high.  With devices like the kindle, access to books are cheap and easy.

But what about people who can't afford books?  Who can't afford the internet? What about families with children who have the desire to read, but don't have the opportunity?  The Library was built for them.

When I was a boy, my mother used to take me to the library every so often.  At that age, I was never one for reading, but I loved origami books.  I must have checked all of them out at that library.  

Its been a long time since I've been in one.  The first thing that hit me when I walked in was that smell.  The smell of books.  Oh man, it was beautiful.  At that moment, the memories came back to me.  A sudden thrill of excitement electrified my blood.  It was unbelievable.  To feel that after living with depression for so long was liberating.  It really was my first true feeling of joy since my illness hit me hard 2 years ago.

People say that libraries are out of date.  They are wrong.  Libraries have adapted to technology.  I discovered this during my visit yesterday.  Turns out that there's a public app called [overdrive.](https://www.overdrive.com/)  You can check out books online and use your browser and other devices to connect.  Amazing isn't it?  I would have never discovered this had I not went.

Libraries need to stay.  I'm not saying this because my heart has been woven into them since I was a child, but because there are others like me who need them.  Yesterdays experience was incredible.  I'm glad /r/books is here so that I can share it with you.

**EDIT:**  *Wow.  I had no idea how much support I would receive from the community.  Thank you so much for your well wishes.  I shared this with you because it meant a lot to me and this is something I can't really talk about with the people I know because of the stigma associated with mental illness.  Its good to know there are people here who share the same enthusiasm about the subject that I do.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3fbzrl/im_jobless_im_disabled_im_living_with_my_parents/,2015-07-31T20:24:11Z,211,1118,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
a2zzxl,"The Kane Chronicles is Rick Riordan's best work, and I'm sad it's really underrated in favor of the more ""mainstream"" pantheons.","Rick Riordan sparked my interest in various mythologies, but the best of the many he's made, at least in my eyes, is the Kane Chronicles. The whole series was strong from start to finish. 

The Egyptian Gods are my favorite pantheon in the Riordanverse, because they ACTUALLY DO THINGS IN THE STORY! . 

Not to knock on the other books, but the Greek and Norse gods all felt very samey. There are three kinds: ""The I WISH I could help, but the rules, yada yada"" or ""How dare you human, don't even breathe the same air as me""  or ""Now that you've solved the problem that I caused, here's a DRIPLET of help so we can progress the plot, now leave me alone"". There are a few exceptions, but for the most part, the gods were all the same, callous arrogant people, which is the point, but I wish they had a bit more depth than that. They exist more as obstacles than help, and the relationship between gods and mortals never felt very deep, only a shallow, grudging one. 

In contrast, the Egyptian gods are so varied! As opposed to the almost bystander presence of gods in the other books,  the villains and main supporting characters consist of gods, and all of them are very fun and interesting in their own way. The nature of the gods in this world means they aren't worshipped, they do not birth demigods, and must pull their own weight. They also feel like timeless gods and their appearances and personalities felt like a perfect balance of modern sensibilities and ancient wisdom. 

The good gods here are actually actively helpful towards fighting the forces of Chaos instead of being distracted somewhere else. There's a dynamic here that wasn't present with the oh-so-high-and-mighty Greek gods. They have personalities outside of their sphere of influence, their own troubles, and we actually feel for them when they fight because it's established they CAN be killed by non-gods, albeit with great effort. 

In addition, magic. The magic in the world of Egypt is so interesting! The concepts are simple, but the applications and rules are nuanced enough that there's a lot of clever ways for them to apply it in a fight. Much more interesting to me than the natural inclinations of the demigods such Percy's thing being water and horses. The Duat is a fantastic and imaginative representation of the afterlife, and pretty different from the usual interpretations. 

Lastly, most of the characters are developed really naturally. Magnus Chase and the Heroes of Olympus storylines had problems with being too on-the-nose about being inclusive or being too snarky, to the point certain characters became nothing but their stereotype. The Kane Chronicles balances this the best out of all of the books Riordan has made. Carter and Sadie being African-American-British, with very different skintones and backgrounds, means they got odd looks, but it never defined them, nor did they feel the need to remind you of that fact every other chapter (*cough* Alex and Sam in Magnus Chase *cough*). They also progressed in their power and personalities believably, because despite all they go through, I can still point at their character and say ""this is the same character deep down"" and not just another character entirely. 

While I still hold a lot of love for the PJ books for introducing me to Riordan, it was the Kane Chronicles that really filled me with that wonder at learning something new,and I hope more people pick it up and read it, because Egyptian mythology is so cool.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/a2zzxl/the_kane_chronicles_is_rick_riordans_best_work/,2018-12-04T11:52:09Z,64,507,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
xlim0z,Lonely Castle in the Mirror: Fave book of the year so far.,"Set in modern day Tokyo, this novel revolves around 13 year-old Kokoro (her name means 'heart' in Japanese) who struggles with severe anxiety and decides to stop going to school due to a traumatic event. One day, the oval-shaped mirror in her room shines brightly and she is teleported through it to a castle where she meets six more children around her age as well as the Wolf Queen who is in charge. They all have about under a year to find a key which will unlock the wishing room in the castle which will grant them only one of them one wish. They can enter the castle anytime during the year but if they don't leave the castle by five o'clock  they will get eaten by a wolf. 

This was one of my favourite novels of the year by far. I loved the fairytale aspects that Tsujimura creates through her seductive storytelling to talk about real-life problems that many of us will have also experienced as teenagers. The themes are crucial in this novel: friendship, social insecurity, bullying etc. 

Throughout all this, there continues to be the underlying mystique and mystery of the castle. What is it? Where did it come from? These are questions that run through the readers mind. But chapter by chapter, the puzzles begin to fit together and the author creates an amazing well-crafted story. Heart-warming, emotional, funny at times and thought-provoking. The last third of the book totally blew me away and gave me goosebumps. 

This book has the power to pull you from the darkness, encompass you with a blanket of comfort and show you that most problems have solutions. Tsujimura mixes magic and realism to explore the issue of adolescent growth and the toll on mental health. She touches upon society's acceptance and expections, past memories and past trauma.

Molloy,"I am a huge fan of Jon Donohue and last year i saw the movie and and recently i finally got to read the book (i know i am sorry for such a sin) but i must say this was a fun and fascinating memoir. Well written and reads very quickly. Flew through this in a few sittings. Basically an action packed story of how one man connects his soldier supporting neighborhood with their friends and loved ones serving in Vietnam. Amazing adventure and a touching perspective of a very nightmar-ish(??) and severely unpopular war. This book was an incredible true story that showcased an honorable man larger than life. His unselfishness and sacrifice to bring warm wishes and love to friends and neighbors serving in Vietnam was nothing short of heroic and insanely admirable. His message sharing journey turned into a mission of survival and great risk to help and protect numerous people around him. Simply an inspiring and superb piece of Vietnam war history.

2uvzkj,I finished the Wheel of Time and I've never been so grateful to be finished with a series. I should have skipped it. [Spoilers inside],"By the time I got to the 6th book, I was done being excited about the series. I stayed because of the excellent characterization and Jordan's ability to genuinely surprise me.

But having gotten to the end, I wish I had never started in the first place. 

First, the nomenclature. Jordan's propensity for giving things silly names (Trolloc), unpronounceable names (like whatever Perrin's hammer is called), or--even better--silly and unpronounceable names, like whatever weird word they used instead of just calling them Fades, Halfmen, or Shadowsouled all the time. Personal names aren't any better. What *possible* reason could there be to make the last name of several main characters (Damodred) look and sound almost identical to one of the primary antagonists (Demondred)? And this is leaving aside the sheer number of names in the series and the fact that the reference section at the back of each book got sparser with each volume. Presumably they could no longer fit in a full list of every character and important concept after so many books, but that doesn't help me when whole chapters pass without me figuring out who any of these people are because it's been two books, and as many months for me, since I last heard from them. 

There were a number of other issues for me, including the world not being terribly compelling to me, though they are more my thing than Jordan's. I won't blame him for my lack of effort. 

But I cannot excuse the ending. The *entire* premise of the series is that Rand is the only person who can defeat the bad guy and that he will die in the process. We spend pages and chapters of characters dealing with the inevitable death of Rand and what it will mean for them and the world. Every prophecy, every prediction, and every inclination of thought points to Rand dying when he faces the enemy at the end.

I understand that it is difficult to kill main characters. There's a real danger of losing a huge chunk of an audience doing something like that, as well as the danger to the narrative. 24, for example, wouldn't be 24 without Jack Bauer, so they can't kill him in the series. I get it and it's fine. I don't mind writers not wanting to kill major characters, though I love it when they have the courage to do it. What I can't stand is when they *pretend* they are killing a major character and then chicken out. How many times are we going to be told that Mat dies before all emotional impact is lost? The last sentence of two successive subsections indicated that Mat dies, including the words ""They died together"" and he still didn't die. 
Still, Mat's a great character and I would have been disappointed had he died. I wish Jordan hadn't bothered to pretend, but whatever, it's a common thing.

But there is no excuse for not killing Rand. The whole series builds up to this final conflict which we are assured will end in Rand's victorious death...and then *somehow* it doesn't. I feel every bit as betrayed as when writers pull the ""it was all a dream"" twist at the end of a story. What was the point of all the drama dealing with Rand's death when he wasn't going to die? I don't think I could ever read the series a second time, since knowing Jordan cops out at the end would ruin the emotional journey for me. 

I will never cease to be impressed with Jordan's characterization and skill with plot twists. The way that characters were blind to their stunningly obvious logical and character flaws while we as the audience could see them clearly is a wonderful use of dramatic irony. Really impressive stuff. I just wish I could have gotten all that in a much, much, *much* shorter form without the ridiculous names and with a more satisfying ending.

13ikvsf,"Donna Tartt's The Goldfinch, a wild theory","Call this a conspiracy theory or fan fiction or whatever, but I think Theo did die in Amsterdam. He successfully committed suicide, and the last section was actually written by Hobie. Here are my reasons in no particular order.

1) The last section leaves a lot of loose ends unaddressed. Most importantly, Theo's killing of Martin which figured so hugely in his breakdown seem to have vanished into thin air. And then what happened to Havistock and Lucius who were so eager to take down Hobie's good name? 

2) The legal reward money sounds like utter bullshit. Not a word or hint in all 700+ pages but suddenly there it is, millions of dollars, just like that.  

3) When Theo and Boris separate on the bridge after the killing of Martin, Theo says of Boris, emphasis mine: ""**My last sight of him**, he was talking on the phone with the window rolled down and leaning out, in extravagant clouds of auto fume, to see what was going on with the stalled van ahead.""

In conventional speech, saying ""my last sight of him"" could just mean Theo's last sight of Boris on the bridge before they separate. But coming as that sentence did on top of so much random fuckery that makes Boris look as sketchy as possible, Donna Tartt successfully plants the notion, at least in my mind, that Theo never saw Boris again. 

4) Theo saw his mother in the mirror. In the last section it is implied this vision of her saved Theo from a death from overdose and turned his life around. But if one were to question whether Theo actually wrote the last section, then her appearance in the mirror could actually be a heralding of Theo's own death.

5) The last section where Theo goes back to NYC to make good on the fakes he sold is so random. Only he and Hobie actually appear in person in any substantive way which makes me suspect Hobie wrote it as Theo or something. 

6) The sudden 180 on Boris is not believable. There's nothing to indicate Boris gives a shit about Theo. He only gets back in touch with Theo when the painting is lost so as to manipulate Theo into helping him get it back from a stolen art mafia ring.

7) So after 700+ pages of drug abuse, lies, betrayals of various magnitudes and random deaths and various sundry other tragedies, the book ends...happily? Sketchy Boris turns out to be the fairy godmother and the narrator resumes his NYC life basically uninterrupted and a couple of millions of dollars richer. I don't buy this.

8) Supposing Hobie actually wrote the last section, then the fairy tale like ending actually makes sense. Things work out as Hobie wishes/fantasizes they did: Theo lives, the money to make good on the fakes appears out of thin air, Boris wasn't a deceiving shithead who treated Theo like a dispensable meat bag.  

8) Literary precedence. Atonement, An Occurrence on Owl Bridge, Lolita, are all books where the author pulls some kind of gotcha on the MC or first person narrator. 

So yeah this theory has about a million holes and is closer to fan fiction than theory in the near total absence of supporting evidence.

4byp16,Does anyone have a good soundtrack for reading The Hobbit?,"I never tried to listen to music while reading. A book critic that I know said on one of her reviews that she listened to the soundtrack of The Witcher(game) while reading it(The Last Wish), so I got curious about this idea. Even though I am at the half of the book, I will read the Lord of the Rings after it, so a soundtrack for that would be nice too.

voag8n,Just finished the Hyperion series and hoping to discuss it here,"Last week I finally finished the last book in the Hyperion series. Overall I thought the series was great but the last two books were definitely pretty disappointing in some ways. 

I think these books have some of the best worldbuilding I've ever seen in a Sci Fi series. The Hegemony feels very real and the farcaster connected WorldWeb is a great concept that is executed extremely well. The River Tethys and the houses where the rooms were connected by farcasters were particularly cool and well imagined. The first book is so cool in how just throws you right into the universe with very little explanation and then lets you figure it out yourself. I know for some people that can be very confusing but for me, I love it. I loved the Canterbury tales-esqe structure of the first book and made room for all different kinds of narratives. I thought the Shrike and the Time Tombs were both very cool concepts that were well executed. The narrative of Sol Weintraub was particularly heartbreaking and compelling. Seeing Rachel grow younger and younger was really difficult.

The TechnoCore is a very interesting concept although personally I found them to be a bit to cartoonishly evil, I wish that the good sides of the TechnoCore and the civil war was fleshed out a bit more although I understand how difficult that would be to do because it's very hard to write non human intelligences. The idea that they would need human brains to draw computing power off of is also very outdated now that we know how ludicrously powerful computers can be, but we can write that off to the books being written in the late 80s and 90s. I still liked the reveal though and the concept of the TechnoCore being hyperparasitic and how this prevented them from evolving ethics was fascinating to think about. 

I think the second book was my favorite overall, it answers just enough questions from the first book to be very satisfying while still leaving a lot to mystery. I really liked the character of the Hegemony CEO Meina Gladstone and enjoyed seeing her be fleshed out. 

The Fall of the WorldWeb was a crazy moment although it also included one of the most hilariously racist things I've ever seen in Sci Fi where each different world that of course is dominated by one particular race responds in the most racially stereotypical way possible to the catastrophe. It seemed like something the author thought was funny and realistic but both the idea of certain races owning certain planets and then those races having really archetypal responses to the Fall is just straight up racist. Speaking of racism it's also always notable to me how much Western authors tend to assume white Western hegemony will continue in the future. There are far more characters of obviously European descent in the book, and while there are some token characters of other races, the lack of Indian and Chinese characters in the books while they form a huge majority of the global population now pretty much implies some kind of genocide. It's a huge blind spot. The only Chinese character I can even think of has a Western first name implying that she grew up not in a Chinese cultural area but a Western one. Of course there is the Tian Shan planet at the end of the last book but that is more of a Buddhist planet than a Chinese one. 

The third and fourth books were really disappointing to me both because there was a main character who is a bog standard self insert action hero and because the whole One Who Teaches prophecy/messiah thing just seemed really out of place. The romance between Aenea and Raul was also just straight up uncomfortable. Why the fuck would you ever think that writing a romance where a 32 year old meets an 11 year old and they eventually end up together would be a good idea? I knew Simmons was going to use time shenanigans to make the age gap less bad, but he seemed to think that once she was a legal adult it was all good. A romance between a 33 year old and a 21 year old is still weird, especially with all the totally unnecessary sex scenes. It really felt like the author was just writing his own creepy sexual fantasy and it had almost no impact on the actual plot. 

I loved the Pax and how fleshed out that was, I loved the return of the Inquisition, and the papal politics and stuff was super cool. The philosophy about the Void Which Binds and how it works was interesting although there was a bit too much of Aenea just pontificating about it, and it got boring. Aenea in general was just kind of an odd and not very compelling character. She is always not saying certain things just to preserve narrative surprise and it gets really annoying. I was also very confused by the role of the Shrike in the last two books. He becomes Aenea's protector even though it is revealed at the very end that he is a creation of the Machine God. As far as I can tell it is never explained why the Machine God wants Aenea to stay alive and complete her work. The fight scenes between the Shrike and Nemes were still very cool though. I also loved the concept of the Dyson Sphere made of a giant tree and the idea of covering the entire universe with life. I do wish the Ousters had also gotten a little more fleshed out, and I didn't like that they had no answer whatsoever to the Pax's Core technology. Do the Ousters just have no AI at all, or no ability to match the Core's technology?

Anyway the bottom line for me is that I would highly recommend the first two books, and say you should only read the last two if you are very invested in the story. I wish I had the wherewithal to rewrite the last two books and take the whole romance plot out or at least change it so it is less creepy.  Still one of the best Sci Fi series I've ever read though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/voag8n/just_finished_the_hyperion_series_and_hoping_to/,2022-06-30T15:00:23Z,9,46,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
14cos7q,The feeling you get when your done with a really good one.,"So my discussion doesn't directly involve a book. But the feeling I have this morning is one I've had many times after finishing one. The sub I wanted to post on is locked hoping to change the third party thing going on so I'll post here. Because you guys might be the only ones that get me right now. If it's too far out of bounds let me know. 

Aside from reading I play JRPGs many of witch have engrossing stories and fit the and fix the need for a good adventure for me. And as all good stories must, last night the game came to an end. It was almost 20 years old I think and I've never herd a peep about the ending. Perhaps because it was assumed perhaps because no true fan wanted ti spoil it. 

The tragic end to my hero, and the way it played out  was more than I could handle. I'm gutted this morning. Replaying the last bits of the adventure in my mind, wishing there was more to his particular story. 

Like a good book, when I beat a game, I can't wait for the next adventure. The thrill of the opening credits is addicting to me as the cover of my next book.  The imagery the same as that feel as the weight in hand. The sound rivals the smell of the book store. The anticipation build till I ores start or open to the first page. 

Not today. Today I think I'll morn my hero and maybe in a bit I'll carefully select my next adventure. Not now though. I just don't have it in me to move on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14cos7q/the_feeling_you_get_when_your_done_with_a_really/,2023-06-18T16:36:09Z,2,0,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
124gzfc,Experience Controlled by the Reader,"I've recently finished reading most of Ready Player One. I stopped at the last chapter the first time around, I wanted to hold on the anticipation and the excitement of the whole thing. The second time I read all the way up to the resolution of the relationship tension between the protagonist and love interest.

I decided it would be better if I didn't go any further than that. Based on how things were all >!lining up perfectly!< for the protagonist I guessed the relationship would also follow that pattern. So I just sat and imagined my own ending - they meet, they become friends and they separate as friends.

As I was writing about this somewhere else I wondered if the author would be disappointed that I didn't see the thing through to their end. And I realized I had done the same thing with other books. I mean I had read the Deathly Hallows for years before I knew how it ended and I only learned that from the movies.

Not to mention other media, I waited aaages to watch the last episode of Firefly. Just looping around in my favorite version of the universe. I guess because when there's unknowns in the future a universe has so much potential but then once you experience the future it's set in stone. You can't change it.

Thinking back now the first character I lost to ""stone futures"" was Neo from the Matrix. I wish I'd never watched the sequels. And maybe what I took away from that is to be wary of the universe I like being destroyed by the creator for progression of their story.

I was just thinking if I ever wrote a book I'd probably keep in mind there might be people out there who skipped the end of the previous ones. I didn't really have a large point to posting this I'm just rambling.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/124gzfc/experience_controlled_by_the_reader/,2023-03-28T07:37:27Z,5,10,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
zj0g8k,"I just finished the ""Fable"" series by Adrienne Young.","Sorry this is so long. I'm trying to sort my feelings out about this series now that I just finished all the books. Would like anybody's thoughts on the ""Fable"" series by Adrienne Young. I tried not to write any spoilers in here. Just the premise of each book. 

 I absolutely loved the 1st book. I read it on my Kindle. Then I purchased the audio book and listened to it more than 3 more times while I was making art. I just I loved the world building and writing so much and the voice actors were enjoyable to listen to. I also couldn't find a book that sparked my interest as much. Its not a 'pirate book' as much as it is an interesting story of an interesting girl that happens to take place on the sea. 

I only listened to Namesake as an audio book, it was good not great. Left me wanting so much more. But the series jumps to ""The Last Legacy."" Is a different story completely but in the same universe with a few of the smaller characters from the other stories. I thought it was ok. I did listen to it more than once. I was confused about parts and struggled to put all the pieces together. Which I found a bit frustrating. Thus, listening more than once because I went back and read Fable and namesake again to see if I was missing things. I wish I had had made notes on the characters (for both Saint, Namesake and The Last Legacy.) Maybe that was the authors intent? To make the audience think about the where and the who and the why? I found it frustrating.

The forth book just came out, ""Saint,"" and it filled in most of the missing pieces from the other books. I'm not sure how I would feel about it as a stand alone novel and I'm debating on going back and reading the other 2 books again now that I have all the info. I'm a little disappointed at the slow drip of important information. I was very upset with the character Saint through most of the the first 2 books. I wish the Author could have given me SOMETHING more about him earlier in the series. 

Also, just a side note on the the audio book. It changed the pronunciation of one of Isolde's name in Saint. In book 1 and 2 its pronounced Is-ol'dee and the forth its pronounced Is-old. Yikes. Who wants to be named 'Is Old'? 

What did you think of the books and the revelations about Saint and Isolde in the last book? Do you think the Author told the story in the most effective and entertaining order? 

I almost feel like Saint should have come sooner in the series, rather than the last as a prequel. I know it would take some of the mystery aspect out but, damn, give me something to understand the premises. Throw me a fricken bone over here! lol.  I feel like the Last Legacy would have been more interesting having known just a bit more back story. I think I have to read them all again, back to back, just to decide if I liked the series. That's a little frustrating too. I suppose I must like the story enough to be willing to read them all again but, I've read the 1st 3 several times already!!! (Fable for enjoyment but namesake and last legacy, I had to read/listen to more than once just for clarity, not because I loved them so much). 

I really WANT to love the series. I keep telling myself ""If I just read it all again.... Maybe?"" 

Side note:
I tried to read another book by this author (""Spells for Forgetting"") and found it to be deliberately vague and didn't enjoy the rhetorical tools they used in the story telling. It was so very slow. So very, very slow. Felt disjointed. Trying to hard for suspense. Like, ""I see what you're trying to do and I don't like it."" Kinda thing. Like a, ""get to the fricken point already"" feeling the whole book. Major, deliberately clipped, story lines and when I got the whole picture of the specific stort line, it was anti climatic. It turned me off and I struggled to get through that book. Fable had a few parts like that but I was taken away by the world building it didn't bother me as much as it did in The Last Legacy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zj0g8k/i_just_finished_the_fable_series_by_adrienne_young/,2022-12-11T17:22:24Z,1,15,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
fw06r1,The Long Winter by Laura Ingalls Wilder,"I loved all the Little House books as a child, but this was always a favorite. I re-read it in an afternoon over the weekend, and found new perspective as an adult, and in context of current events. The family’s resourcefulness was inspiring - grinding wheat in a coffee grinder, twisting hay to burn for fuel, making a little food last. I related to Laura’s recounting of her mental state. At first, the excitement of town in the winter, being cozy at home through the initial blizzards. Then the growing fear of the blizzards and cold and being hungry. Then the onset of what reads to me as depression: Laura felt tired and slow and as though it would never end. I wish we all had a “spring” to look forward to, a day on the calendar.  

Anyone else read this, recently or as a child? What resonated with you? Anyone know additional history or context for that winter? Weird fact - the Ingalls family actually had a young couple and their baby staying with them, but Laura cut that because she wanted the focus on her family unit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fw06r1/the_long_winter_by_laura_ingalls_wilder/,2020-04-06T14:58:37Z,33,122,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

ujq79v,The Hidden Palace,"This is the sequel to the Jinni and the Golem and I really loved it, my only problem was the ending and I was wondering if anyone else who read the book felt this way.

The first book left no loose threads with a closed book ending, but the sequel left about 3/4 loose threads I now find myself wondering about. It’s a bit frustrating especially bc after looking into it, there’s a good chance there won’t be a 3rd installment in the series. Now I’m left wondering what will happen to the jinni in Chicago. Will Sophia ever reunite with the jinniyeh? I wish there weren’t so many questions still about the character’s futures.

Also, if this was to be the last installment, I would’ve preferred the golem and the jinni to get more one on one time at the end. They barely even interact after the climax and don’t talk at all about their break up. That felt rushed. 

I loved the book, but tbh I wish I hadn’t read it unless I had known for sure there would be a 3rd book bc now I’m left with an unsatisfied feeling after feeling fully satisfied after book 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ujq79v/the_hidden_palace/,2022-05-06T15:37:40Z,1,3,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
1ap84k5,"Growing up, it seemed like Tom Clancy was everywhere. I can see why, but the books didn't age well.","In the 90's, you'd always see one of his books on shelves at the bookstore, grocery store, airport. And a new movie or show was always coming out, with his name attached. I was more into detective books for most of my life. But after watching the Jack Ryan TV series, I figured I'd try the books.

This is sort of a multi-book review, sorry, it's long.

For a first novel, The Hunt for Red October really was a banger. The inside of a sub is a weird, claustrophobic setting, and makes for some interesting built-in tension... You're in this huge, slow-moving whale of a ship, which can't reasonably dodge attacks, and if you get hit, everyone on board dies a horrifying death. The level of detail really sells it, you'd swear Tom Clancy spent half his life in a sub, but he was never in the military (except for going into the ROTC and being dq'd for eyesight). Before writing books, he sold insurance.

Clancy goes into the circumstances that might cause an embittered high-level submarine captain to defect, he talks about people's motivations and backgrounds quite a bit, so it's not all dry technical military stuff. The captain comes up with a clever plan to make his defection happen, which necessitates murdering the always-present political officer during a deployment, and duping the crew into thinking it was an accident. The plan nearly falls apart at the finish line, and we're introduced to lowly CIA analyst Jack Ryan, who comes up with his own plan to protect Captain Ramius, save the crew, and somehow acquire the sub. At the end, Ryan survives a shootout, and we establish that the hero has both brains and brawn.

So, I decide to continue the series, and for a while, it's pretty good.

Patriot Games puts Ryan into a more personal conflict with a branch of the IRA, shows how he came to be at the CIA, and establishes his credibility as an action hero. He's maybe a little too perfect, as protagonists go, but likeable. He's a former marine, which establishes him as a trained badass, but has a back injury that causes him to walks with a limp, which makes him seem little more humble and vulnerable. This somehow doesn't stop him from surviving gunfights, and later... the author writes away his crippling injury with a genius medical procedure. 

He's always portrayed as this honorable boy scout (literally) who just wants to do his duty and protect his family. Along the way, he gets to be a millionaire (thanks to a bit of technically-legal insider trading, and this is the closest he comes to having a flaw) So now the hero is rich, which is something I've seen a lot of authors do, to sort of handwave away a lot of the everyday life challenges that might keep the protagonist from going on adventures. 

The Cardinal of the Kremlin revisits the idea of protecting a Russian defector, or rather, a high-level bureaucrat who has been passing info to the CIA for years, and along the way, Ryan somehow forces the KGB chairman to come along. We get to see him less as an action hero, and more as a smart guy who has to work out the political angles. We spend a lot of time in Russia, which sort of puts him in the lion's den. The book is a bit of a slog, but I think Clancy's portrayal of Russia is one of his strengths, he seems comfortable with talking about the quirks of russian politics, and his characters are fleshed out.

Clear and Present Danger was, for me, a minor dud. The US president is in a tight race to get re-elected, and the public thinks he's ineffective at stopping drug trafficking, so he initiates a bunch of small, covert military actions in Columbia to wreck the drug kingpin's operations. It's probably illegal, despite the pretext that the drug trade is a 'clear and present danger' to national security, and it feels a bit like Clancy writing up a daydream fantasy of ""what if we just bombed these scumbags?"". There's a subplot where some hardened rapist smugglers are put through a mock execution and the Coast Guard captain who does this is sort of given a token finger wag for it. There is a somewhat interesting perspective from the generic kingpin's right-hand-man, a well-trained spy who seduces a secretary (we'll see that again later) and gets critical information, which is used to blow up the director of the FBI and the head of the DEA. The president counters by having the kingpin's mansion bombed during a meeting with other high-level baddies. Jack Ryan is basically just there to get outraged when the president decides to leave the small special forces group stranded in indian country, and helps extract them when the administration was prepared to write them off. 

I was left with the feeling that Clancy's understanding of South America just isn't really as nuanced as his portrayal of Russia, and the characters are more simplistic. The cartel kingpin is blustery, a sort of tinpot tyrant, his henchmen are just generic bad guys.

The Sum of All Fears is much better, and it's where the author starts to peak, but also kind of the beginning of the end for Jack Ryan. 

The plot is very slow-burn, detailing how some terrorists gain access to an unexploded nuclear bomb... it was loaded during a tense moment in the middle east, was supposed to be unloaded, but an over-eager pilot takes off with it and gets shot down, and the bomb is lost in some farmer's field, where it's rediscovered 20 years later. For most of the book, tension is built as the terrorists find allies and gain the technical resources needed to restore it to operation, and they decide to target the Super Bowl stadium in Denver. Ryan meanwhile, isn't clued into this for most of the book because he's dealing with a smear campaign from the white house foreign affairs advisor. If Jack wasn't heroic enough yet, he literally brings peace to the middle east. But the advisor, a careerist who's found her way into the president's bed, has a grudge because Jack was snippy to her once. So she robs him of credit. Then uses investigators to dig up dirt on him, which leads to whispers that he's cheating on his wife. These are false, of course, because Jack Ryan's a bit of a saint. 

How much of a saint? Ryan regularly visits a widow, because he watched her husband die during a military mission, and has vowed to put all 10(!) of his kids through college. He makes good on his promise. The good-guyness of Jack Ryan can, at times, be a bit overdone.

I like the book because the author isn't afraid to avoid the predictable ""good guys foil the plot at the last second"" ending, and without totally spoiling everything... the bomb does go off, and the terrorists are portrayed as very sharp, initiating some false-flag attacks with Russia to distract everyone from the real culprits and let their enemies destroy each other. But Jack figures this out, realizing that that the president is being manipulated by his mistress into a possible nuclear war. There's sort of a Cuban Missile Crisis moment, and he figures out a way to avert war despite his warnings falling on deaf ears... by directly contacting the Russian president and explaining the situation. 

President Fowler overreacts when he realizes the true source of the threat, and orders a rage-induced nuclear strike on the middle east, but Ryan again steps in and saves the day by making use of the two-man rule, which (if you're old enough) you may have seen before in WarGames. We see him deliver a thorough chiding, which is deserved, but makes the character start to feel less like a boy scout analyst and occasional action hero, and more like a moral authority whose crowning moments come down to him wagging his finger and really telling someone off. 

I skipped Without Remorse, which is an origin story for one of the recurring characters, a former SEAL and master spy named John Clark. 

Debt of Honor might be where the series starts to flag, but it has a killer ending. A flaw in the gas tanks of a few Japanese cars leads to a highly publicized accident leading to a handful of deaths. Politicians sieze on this to enact a new trade policy with Japan... the country is portrayed as being under the control of a handful of corrupt industrialists who have exploited an unequal trade policy for years to gain control in American markets. The new policy threatens these industrialists, who hatch a plot to retaliate, which is partially fueled by one man's personal hatred of America. 

This book feels like it has a more overtly political message, and is clearly an exension of the author's political beliefs. There's some token effort to explain Japanese culture and the mindset of the bad guys, but they're still very much the bad guys, portrayed as misguided and greedy, with somewhat less depth than the Russians tend to get in his earlier books. There was a minute, during the 90's, where Japan and its culture were this cool mysterious thing... we had movies like Rising Sun, which I think helped coax this book into existence. And maybe James Clavell's work was an influence?

One area that I like about the book is, they explore an interesting idea on what economic warfare might look like, and gets into cyberwarfare a bit, though there's also the obligatory military clashes. Japan seizes control of the Marianas, a US territory, and attacks some military assets, hiding behind the claim that it was an unfortunate accident, one that makes their seizure of the territory possible. Ryan figures out a neat, ""so simple it's brilliant"" way to save the economy, and advises the president in a way that results in a tidy, more-or-less proportional response that hurts the Japanese economy and a few of their own boats and aircraft, leading to surrender. Then, at the last minute, it all goes to shit, and I'll try to avoid a spoiler except to say that Clancy looks like he saw 9/11 coming back in 1994 early.

By the next book, Jack Ryan is president, and for me... President Ryan is a lot less interesting than humble CIA analyst Ryan. The bad guys this time are Muslim extremists, led by an ambitious Iranian leader who orchestrates the assasination of the Iraqi president, and successfully invades, ""uniting"" the countries. He then quietly has a team engineer a nasty bio-warfare weapon based on Ebola. Anyone who grew up in the 90's might again get that feeling that... these books are very much of their time. ""Outbreak"" (which features a similar disaster) comes out in 1995, and one year later, we have Executive Orders. 

The book does an excellent job of building up several subplots, disasters that put the weight of the world on the president's shoulders. Besides the disease, Jack has to rebuild a crippled government where a lot of the key positions are unfilled, and is taking constant heat in the press. The VP of the last president, was forced to resign for sexual assault, but now is trying to walk it back by orchestrating a technicality that would allow him to claim he's the real president. If Jack is able to survive this, he's still probably heading for doom... one of secret service team is a sleeper agent for the baddies. Meanwhile, there's a plan to kidnap his daughter from daycare. And finally, there's a (honestly unnecessary) subplot where domestic terrorists are trucking a load of fertilizer bombs to the white house. 

It's a pretty ambitious book that explores a lot of ""what-if"" scenarios, but it's somewhat less satisfying for me because the good guys just beat everything. Not effortlessly, at least, but... the kidnappers get outsmarted and blown away, the nutty militia guys get caught before they do any real harm, someone picks up on the sleeper agent's very small errors, the sneaky backdoor coup by the former vice president fizzles, and the damage from the outbreak is minimized by Jack Ryan simply having the national guard restrict travel and tell everyone to stay home and mask up. We can all have a good laugh about the plausibility of that, in retrospect. But it does also occur to me... to Clancy's credit, his far-fetched disaster senarios are actually not so far-fetched. 

It's a good read, just that it feels like the success of the evil plot feels much less ""oh wow, he went there"" than it did in Sum of All Fears. I can see why this book somehow wasn't movie material despite all sorts of dramatic potential. 

Rainbox Six is probably the most standard action-movie material in the books, getting away somewhat from politics and spy stuff and focusing on a bunch of guys who basically shoot guns real good. The focus is on Clark and Chavez, side characters from previous books who are running an elite counterterrorism unit. Coincidentally (or maybe not), this unit comes into existence around the same time as a spike in seemingly random terrorist events... events which are not-so-random, it turns out. The book has a fairly absurd plot where extreme environmentalists decide to end the world with a bioweapon, and it was kind of a weird call by Clancy to dive back into ""Super ebola"" when he just did that in the previous book. The bad guys are cartoonishly deluded and sociopathic, and the stakes absurdly high, and so some tension is removed because clearly Clancy isn't going to let the bad guys kill 7 billion people, unless he's transitioning from military fiction to The Walking Dead.

I decided to quit the books after The Bear and the Dragon... the pacing is lousy, the politics are SUPER heavy-handed, and the plot is too much of a rehash of previous material. It generally feels less plausible, and the bad guys more cartoonish than ever before. It's Debt of Honor in a scooby doo villain mask. 

Instead of Japan leveraging an uneven trade relationship, it's China. Instead of a small family being blown up by shoddy workmanship, leading to a US boycott... it's a papal ambassador getting blown up by Chinese cops, leading to a US boycott. Pissed off president enacts a new stricter trade policy, and the other country panics and retaliates... in this case, by trying to invade Russia and steal a wealth of recently-discovered natural resources. Once again, we have a secretary to a high-level politication getting seduced, leading to criticial info. Except she kind of just gigglingly says ""ok I'll install spyware on my PC for you"" because the CIA spy gives her good dick. It's a lot less nuanced than the seduction of the FBI director's assistant in Clear and Present Danger. The ministers simply decide to start a war with Russia (and, by extension, USA and NATO) and somehow the voice of reason gets shouted down. They bank on a military advantage, but the advantages gets wiped out by new space-age technology, and just like that... the war is over, the warmongers are deposed, the arrogant foreigners are put in their place. It's all very on-the-nose, and just kind of feels like ""USA smart and good, China dumb and bad"". There's a brief nuclear scare that feels contrived and has the kind of ""good guys always win at the last minute"" ending that Clancy avoided in earlier books.

---

tl;dr

So... Clancy's strengths: 

The books are always steeped in technical detail, which really adds to the realism. When he talks about life in a sub, you'd swear he spent months at sea. When he talks about how they repair and improve the yield of this nuke, you'd swear he spent the last ten years working on nuclear bombs. He sounds like he's done his homework on everything from the internal politics of the CIA, to the black markets that sprung up after the fall of Communism, to the technical challenges of shooting down a missile.

The dialogue is mostly solid, with the occasional contrived and theatrical monologue. Jack Ryan gets increasingly preachy in later books, and several characters jump on soapboxes. 

The books are very ambitious, trying to delve into exactly what it must feel like to be a fly on the wall when a president decides to launch nukes, or send troops somewhere, or fend of political attacks, or make a difficult and unpopular decision to handle a national crisis. Everything has this huge geopolitical scale, except maybe the 2nd book where it's a little more about Ryan and his family being directly targeted. 

But the thing that killed the books for me (and this gets worse and worse, over the years) is the politics. 

The plots are very much the product of Clancy's political views, and his upbringing during the cold war. At first, it's not too bad. I lean left, but I thought ""ok, this guy's conservative, but he seems sane. I could talk to this guy"". The Russians go from the bad guys, to frenemies, to simply friends, and I remember during the 90's that it was kind of hip for the younger generation to talk about supporting Russia, I guess rebelling against parents who ranted angrily about commies. You'd hear American throw around terms like glasnost and perestroika, something I remember even as a high-schooler with zero interest in politics. Tom Clancy's Russians seem fleshed out, not too stereotypical, with a variety of perspectives and motivations. 

His Columbians are cartoonish, desperate peasant workers, lazy and careless soldiers, and a kingpin who is straight out of every bad action movie. The Chinese are depicted as completely alien, with irrational and arrogant mindsets, several times Jack Ryan refers to them as ""Klingons"" because their thinking is just so impenetrable and foreign. And if any readers might be bothered by the terms ""Chinks"" or ""Japs"", well... you're gonna be seeing a lot of that. 

There's too many unnecessary detours into thinly veiled political rants. If you were wondering about Clancy's stance on abortion, gun control, the war on drugs, military spending, tax policy, foreign policy, or the environment... don't worry, he'll tell you. He'll contrive a scene where the wealthy good-guy former hedge fund manager talks tells you how those 'little slant-eyed fucks' are screwing America with their trade policies. He'll contrive a scene where someone wonders ""why would anyone want to kill a little baby?"". Someone will also tell you how ""this is the true damage wrought by communism"". Every environmentalist is a ""tree hugger"" and when he talks about women, sometimes it's like he's just paying lip service to them being smart and capable, like ""she's a great doctor, sure, but she always nags me about my cool smoking"". Or the antagonist in The Sum of All Fears, a careerist who sleeps with the boss to get ahead, and also the nutty environmentalist who helps plot the end of the world. 

It isn't so much that I'm surprised or appalled that someone in a political job would have conservative politics, or that a soldier would use the occasional politically incorrect slur. That's not unrealistic. It's just that throughout all the books, there's this sort of recurring theme where the good guys are... you know, all part of the rich white catholic old-boy network, the bad guys are all the boogeymen from the 80's, communist countries and muslims and Columbia (which kind of was on everyone's radar during the Just Say No era). Inexplicably Clancy does seem to love Saudi Arabia, portrayed as the most reasonable and friendly middle eastern ally.

To his credit, I think he sees himself as progressive, in some areas. Jack Ryan goes on TV to tell people ""don't hate all muslims, because of this on extremist"". His VP is black. He favors nuclear disarmament while simultaneously portraying USA as somewhat crippled by general miltary drawdown. It's just that... often, when you see a kind of cringy bit of casual racism or sexism, it's coming from someone who is unambiguously one of the good guys. 

There's a scene where, after stalled and contentious trade talks, one of the minor diplomats cuts loose from all the formal diplomatic language and rips into one of the Chinese advisors, telling him ""your dicks aren't big enough to get into pissing contest with us"". I thought the author was going for this as being some sort of catalyst for war, an ""oh shit we fucked up"" moment, instead I realized it's just a little wish fulfillment... ""what if we just told them what we REALLY thought"". Jack Ryan compliments him on the comment, later.

Try to imagine John Krasinski delivering this thought from the books, in 2024: ""How could he bring back the ethos of his parents' generation, and a world in which engaged people went to the altar as virgins? Now they were talking about telling kids that homosexual and lesbian sex was okay.""

For me, that stuff is a turnoff, and the politics just get increasingly 'bumper sticker' from book to book. So, I think this is a good place for me to get off the train, since the series is clearly on the decline and later gets taken over by other authors anyway.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ap84k5/growing_up_it_seemed_like_tom_clancy_was/,2024-02-12T19:13:08Z,539,1285,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
11ekux8,The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins,"Cons: 

The action doesn't pick up until 70% of the way through. This isn't unusual for Victorian era books, but none of the characters are interesting enough (or interesting consistently enough) to carry the story for that long. 

This is one of the earliest examples of detective fiction, and you can really tell. It's before people figured out how to write mysteries that are actually fun to read. Like Poe's earlier detective fiction, it reads at times like math word problem where every hole is plugged and everything done and dusted once the story is over. 

The ""love interest"" (Laura Fairlie) is so weak, literally and figuratively. The character isn't actively hateful, but dear god, the author's lack of interest in her really shows. She is despised by her husband, treated like disposable trash by her husband's friend, and is so utterly forgettable nobody can even remember what she looks like. She is a nonentity in every sense of the word, and also the paragon of Victorian womanhood and virtue.

The MC (Walter Hartwright) is so lame. It doesn't surprise me he was the only one in the book to find Laura irresistible. His endless ramblings over his love for her is cringe.  

Pros: 

Collins liked spicy women and it shows. Mrs. Catherick is fantastic. The book really became less dead when she came on the scene. Wish he had given her more words. 

The last 30% is fast paced and highly readable. 

Sir Percival Glyde was unexpectedly sympathetic, and ""the secret"" is not bad so far as that sort of thing goes. I actually figured he was some kind of impostor, but he's actually a victim too. The inheritance should have gone to him, but due to unfair laws of the time towards children born out of wedlock, he would have been legally disinherited.

In general, I like how the villains in the book are actually legitimate victims too. Laura's aunt the countess fosco too was deprived of her inheritance by her own brother (Laura's father) because he didn't approve of her marriage, which is not a crime but certainly a sin on Laura's father part.

All of which ties in with Collins' very progressive notions of social justice which I enjoy a lot in his books. He's never preachy like Dickens when it comes to social criticism.

Conclusion:

Modern critics are hostile to the book and for once I'm with the critics. While the last 30% is good, it's not quite good enough to justify the slog that was the first 70%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11ekux8/the_woman_in_white_by_wilkie_collins/,2023-02-28T21:42:16Z,13,39,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
zh8665,City of Thieves is the first book I ever read in one day,"This book was just so much fun. I absolutely loved Lev and Kolya's banter and I could read a book that was just Kolya's rantings. Their friendship is definitely now one of my favorite fictional relationships. As well, I thought it was hilarious how time in the book was basically tracked by how long it had been since Kolya took a shit last. I've read plenty of books that are widely considered to be funny (a few discworld books, good omens, hitchhikers guide) and the biggest reaction it'll ever get out of me is an exhale from the nose and that's about it. 

This book genuinely made me laugh out loud so many times, like when Kolya says some absolutely heinous things about someone's mother to prove he's a native Russian speaker and not a german spy. Still, I appreciate that it knew when to take itself seriously, some scenes were very tense to read. My only critique is that I wish it was longer. I'm sure this book spits in the face of historical accuracy and everything, but god damn, it was an incredibly fun read that was an absolute breeze to read. I took a quick break from the Count of Monte Cristo for a few days and this book was exactly the quick change of pace I needed to be able to pick up Monte Cristo again and keep reading it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zh8665/city_of_thieves_is_the_first_book_i_ever_read_in/,2022-12-09T20:43:25Z,10,69,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

152dddd,The Father Doesn't Have a Name: The Laziness of Sarah J Maas,"I'm not one to begrudge people their preferences, in life or in their forms of escapism. If the works of Sarah J Maas provide you with a much needed reprieve or help you through dark times or help you see the beauty of the world, I am truly happy for you. Nothing I post here is meant to take away from or invalidate your experiences. That being said, I am not going to be saying anything nice about Maas, specifically her ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" series. If reading unfavorable opinions about your favorite author or favorite series is going to upset you, I do not recommend continuing. Thank you for understanding. 

When I say that Sarah J Maas is lazy, I mean that the amount of effort she puts into her worlds feels rushed and haphazard. She clearly isn't a purely lazy person. No one who can write as many books as she has is. She has achieved more than most of us ever will. But the lack of purposeful thought that she puts into constructing her fictional realities is the central core of my issues with ACOTAR. My many, many issues. I'll begin with the more technical and work my way to the more specific. I'll probably devolve in coherence as I go, I apologize. 

&#x200B;

***PACING***

Books 1 and 3 are the perfect examples of poor pacing in this series. ACOTAR begins quickly enough; Feyre kills a faerie, gets taken from her ungrateful family, and is forced to live among the strange beings of the Fae. She plans to escape, using her skills as a hunter to her advantage. And then...nothing. For a couple hundred pages. Oh, I know, she meets the Suriel, she gets to know the Spring Court, she falls in love, but there is absolutely no urgency, no goal to work toward, NOTHING for her to accomplish to strive toward except to learn to live in luxury until the plot suddenly kicks back in and she has to go Under the Mountain after an exhaustive monologue from a minor character that explains LITERALLY EVERYTHING. No sprinkling of clues or details throughout the lull in the book, just a massive deluge of long-needed context and information that turns it all into a different story. 

I am a patient reader. I got through all 15 books of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time and all 16 of Robin Hobb's Realm of the Elderlings and LOVED them. I can wait for a good payoff. The problem is that Sarah gave us very little to go on (or outright misinformation, ie Amarantha IS the plague) for any of these revelations to feel like anything more than last minute plot points she forgot to include. But these aren't just first book problems.

For all of the migraines Book 2 gave me, Book 3 was so much worse when it came to pacing. There is a war going on. This was established by the end of Book 2. And yet, there isn't even the remotest sense of urgency about it until at least 200 pages into this tome. ""War is here,"" Sarah omniously declares, several weeks after the first shots were fired. It's like declaring the house is on fire halfway into the fire fighters putting it out. Yeah, we know! But even once it begins, everything still moves at a snail's pace with Feyre and her new family just talking in the Night Court about what they should do. That is when Rhys isn't having sex with Feyre over the sounds of wounded soldiers crying out in agony.  

Then, before we know it, the final battle is here. And then it's done. What?

***PLOT***

There isn't one. Well, I'll clarify, there isn't a thought out, overarching narrative. Feyre gets kidnapped, falls in love, PROVES that love, frees the entire magical land, and gets to ride off with her man. Neat and tidy ending. Except, no. Now there's a massive clumsy shift in character for Tamlin so now he's controlling and abusive (something other characters never get called out for) and so now she must be kidnapped - er, rescued - again.

(Tangent, skip if you want: I hate this trope so much. The feminine character gets kidnapped or rescued instead of making the choices and escaping/leaving on her own. Is it a trope? I have no idea, but it is EVERYWHERE. Twilight, Savage Lands, From Blood and Ash, and now ACOTAR, she's just whisked away from one location to the next, a passanger in her own narrative. Absolutely no agency. Luckily, Feyre breaks out of this, but it is beyond infuriating for a work that is lauded as ""Feminist"" to completely remove the agency of the character that is supposed to be empowering! Rant over.) 

The status quo essentially resets and now the REAL plot can begin; Feyre gets a *mate.* Because that is the plot. There are bones of a conflict with stakes but they're not actually important. What's important is Feyre getting a new boyfriend and an entire friend group (she can't make her own friends, she needs them to be provided) and a big house and wealth and power and can you see how bone crushingly boring this is? It's a self insert wish fulfilment checklist. There isn't a PLOT, there is no actual CONFLICT because there was never a chance in hell that Feyre was ever going to lose any of the things she gained. That'd break the fantasy.

A Court of Silver Flames is the only story in the series that has a plot. There is a personal goal for Nesta, she grews personally and physically through her training, she makes her own friends (something Feyre could NEVER do), there are things happening! All of the background stuff about the trove and lake sorceror actively get in the way of the story being told. Even this story is ruined by SJM's laziness but I'll get to that later. 

There is no story to tell, no conflict to occur beyond who will end up getting with who? 

But, ""What about Hybern?"" you'll ask. What about Hybern? 

***WORLDBUILDING***

Hybern want to take over Prythian because they...want to enslave humans again? Because they've been poor since the last war 500 years ago? Because the king and his people are just straight up evil? All of the above, with essentially no elaboration. I know he gives an explanation to Rhys while they're fighting (JUST FIGHT, WHY IS THERE SO MUCH TALKING!?) but it strains my believability. An entire country just sat there grumbling about how it wasn't fair that they lost for 500 YEARS, lost more wealth, became more miserable and starved and somehow managed to get all of the soldiers, ships, and equipment needed to overwhelm Prythian? Seriously? It was better when it was just, ""Yeah, they're evil over there."" Don't provide backstory that instantly conflicts with whats happening. 

But honestly, that's the most creative the worldbuilding actually gets. Name a mythology and Sarah took something from it and just threw it into her world. Oh, the High Lord of the Day Court is named Helion. She took Helios, changed a single letter, and them put him in charge of the Day Court because...SUN. I hate this. 

There are seven Courts and we barely get to know any of them or what makes them unique. How do the politics between Courts work? They don't they gather in one room and throw insults at each other. ""Playing the games of the Courts is dangerous."" NO ONE PLAYS THE GAMES! THEY ALL LITERALLY SAY EXACTLY WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS AND THEN LEAVE. 

The most interesting one is the Night Court and even that falls apart at the slightest bit of probing. There's the Court of Nightmares and the Court of Dreams. Why? Well, the Court of Nightmares is run by the evil, cruel people in the Night Court that live inside of a mountain but the REAL Court is the Court of Dreams with all of Rhys' friends. The Court of Nightmares is just a front. 

Ok, do policies from the CoN actually affect anything? Just the people in the mountain. Are the people in the mountain allowed to leave? No. Are they all evil? No, Mor actually grew up there abused by her parents. 

So Rhys, the most powerful High Lord, King Feminism himself, is keeping an entire population of his people trapped inside of a mountain, more than likely suffering abuse from the other fae, and it's all to protect this ONE city that he's super proud of? Wow, Rhys kinda really sucks when you put it that way. Why does he even have this awful Court if he basically just keeps everyone out anyway? Oh, cause Sarah wanted to have scenes where he's the villain cause that's hot apparently. Sorry, priorities. 

***CONSEQUENCES***

There aren't any. Nothing has any real consequences, good or bad. They have the Weaver and her siblings for the final fight? Yeah, they're gonna die almost instantly. Feyre looked into the mirror that drives people insane? She'll get over it in less than a page and it won't affect any of her behavior going forward. (We never learn what she saw. She tell all of the other Courts but we never get to know, because doing a psychodellic horror sequence of all of her main characters flaws would've been interesting and we can't have that.) Feyre went to spy on Tamlin and Hybern? ALL OF THE INFORMATION SHE BROUGHT BACK CONFIRMED WHAT THEY ALREADY KNEW, IT WAS POINTLESS!

Velaris was attacked!? Oh, we're chill, kids are already playing in the streets again. Ugh. I'm moving on.  

Edit: No, I'm not! Amren sacrifices herself to save everyone but NOPE, SHE'S BACK! Yeah, she's regular Fae now but functionally unchanged soooooo......

And that Rhys fakeout death? Really? Like that was ever going to be a consequence. 

Immortals never die while mortals just bite it constantly. Only immortal Fae matter guys.

***WRITING/STYLE***

This is one of the most repetitive, tedious styles I've ever read. The word ""mate"" is used 202 times in book 3. I cannot tell you how many times male, female, purred, like calls to like, growling, and VULGAR GESTURE are used. No variety, no nuance, always, ALWAYS, the same descriptor!

I won't let Robert Jordan off the hook with all of his ""Folding her arms under her breasts,"" and ""Tugging her braid,"" and ""smoothing her skirts,"" but here's the thing; Robert wrote a complicated, amazing world full of complicated, amazing characters. There are other things to compensate. Sarah did not. There is only the frustration.  

***CHARACTER***

These are not immortal 500 year old beings. They are petty teenagers. So many tongues sticking out, so much ""banter,"" not an adult conversation or interaction to be had. No one has hobbies, no one has any real personality beyond how they relate to Rhys or Feyre. Yes, Amren starts playing with puzzles, the most boring hobby on God's green Earth. She missed intellectual challenges? Maybe she picks up linguistics, history, something she can work at and accomplish things. No? Fine, puzzles. 

AH, but Feyre, she paints! No. No she doesn't She looks at things happening in front of her and gives them cringey titles. If you're going to give a character a hobby, it should be worked into the narrative somehow. Brandon Sanderson does this pretty well with Shallan in Stormlight Archive. Her ability to draw influences how she uses her powers and useful in the narrative. Feyre's painting is more a narrative thermometer for us to gauge how depressed/happy she is. And not a very good one. 

Rhys. I hate Rhys. I hated him when he showed up and drugged Feyre, I hated him when he revealed himself to be King Alpha Male, Champion of Feminism, and I hated him when he kept the dangers of Feyre's pregnancy hidden and threatened to kill Nesta for telling her about it. He is not a character. He is a cardboard cutout for whatever traits Sarah thinks would be hot. OH, a bad boy villain! Oh no, wait, a dark and handsome proto feminist! Wait, a controlling dickhead! Oops.

My problem with him is that before A Court of Silver Flames, he has no flaws. He is the perfect gentleman, always gives Feyre a choice and just CARES so much about his COURT. It's obnoxious. He's such an overdone fantasy that he's no longer appealing, he's insulting. Rather than giving him edges (actual edges, not bad boy nonsense), Sarah settles for making him beyond perfect. No conflict to be had and no effort to be exerted. 

***He Doesn't Have a Name***

Here's the detail that legitametly broke me. The only major character that wasn't evil to die at the end of this trilogy was Feyre's father. His interference changed the course of the battle. His death haunts Nesta and serves as her central internal conflict for her own book. The meaning behind his death and legacy is supposed to be profound.

What's his name?

He doesn't have one. HE DOESN'T HAVE A NAME!!!

HOW!? How do you create a character and actually USE them for such an impactful moment in the ""narative""  and NOT EVEN GIVE HIM A NAME?

Oh, but this feeds into so much more.

What's the King of Hybern's name? Hybern. His Country? Hybern. His people? Hybern. The Island the country is located on? Hybern. 

The Human Queens! Names? Not till book 5! What nations do they rule? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

I know she didn't mean to, but I am beyond insulted at the audacity to not even bother.

***There is Only Maas***

My final point. If you stuck around this long, you are a trooper. Seriously, congrats. I am awful and you deserve an award for putting up with me.

Sarah only brings in her perspective. Now, that's true of any author but what I mean by that is that her priorities are the only ones that matter. 

The only characters that matter are the High Fae. Every named character of worth either starts out as or becomes one. Name me one human who matters. Jurian? That guy got resurrected and is basically immortal now. Name me a MORTAL human who matters to this story. What's the name of Feyre's village? 

The rest of the Fae barely matter, either. If they're not on a Court in the first 3 books, you won't know a thing about them. Only the high class matters, only the Fae matter. Humans? Gross, who cares?

Even personal goals shift according to Maas' will. Why, for the love of GOD, did Nesta physically alter her own body in order to have children? Something she has never expressed she wanted? Because Sarah wants her female characters to have babies. It's fulfilling for her, so they all must want them. Nesta. The newly minted warrior Valkyrie. She can't have ambitions of her own! Give her a baby!

There are only MALES and FEMALES in Maas' world. You can't escape it. STRICT GENDER ROLES FOR ALL! MATES! Oh, there's one token queer character but she has the absolute worst backstory in the history of representation so does it really count? And she's never actually happy or being herself so keep it to yourself, everyone!

Sarah offers us the straightest, whitest world possible. Where it's fine for there to be slums in the cities while the ruler builds a sixth house for his new wife. Where the only people unhappy after a war are the widows, not the soldiers going through PTSD or injuries or anything. Where conflict only arrises because someone is being mean. No resources to worry about, no socio economic concerns, nope, not here!

***Conclusion***

If you couldn't tell, I am miserable. Part of that is from reading these books. And I am being a little unfair. If I wanted Sarah to write her stories perfectly according to what I've complained about, then they wouldn't be hers. She's found an audience and success, and that's wonderful. However, I find it troubling that she writes for an adult audience but doesn't put in the work to make it hold up to basic adult scrutiny. I'm not saying I need her to write up what kind of tax forms the Night Court uses or anything, but just enough information that makes it make sense. 

I have never met Sarah J Maas and probably never will. I can make no judgements on her as a person. I can make assumptions based on her work but I don't think that's entirely fair. All I can do is judge the work itself.

It is lazy. Characters without agency, worlds without coherence, no consequences for any actions, a work that has ""First Draft"" written all over it for me.

164zp76,Ending to The Girl Who Dared series,"Spoiler alert:

.

I just finished the Girl Who Dared To Fight by Bella Forrest and was disappointed with the last book. I’ve so far enjoyed the plot up until the 7th book - not fond of the writing style and the main character drove me nuts sometimes - but I felt that the last book was… disappointing. 

The beginning was super drawn out. It took them forever to get to Liana’s quarters. This could’ve been sped up.
Then to find out the other half of the book basically was a simulation. Then to have a very rushed ending with no closure after all of that trauma for Liana

After almost 7 books of nothing going right for anyone, there wasn’t enough victory in the last book to make up for it. 

Don’t get me wrong, I was content with how it all worked out in the end, but it could’ve been done better. 

I wish the first half moved quicker to her getting into the simulation. Then have a major victory. Then spend the last quarter or half of the book supplying with answers and closure, even with Liana/Grey/Leo. To actually see them working problems out in the tower and how everyone copes and grows from it. Or the author could’ve gone into their life outside the tower and did more development between the people - especially Liana and Grey. There was not much between them, really.

We were given basically one sentence that even showed Liana was happy to have Grey which was regarding him proposing and she was going to say yes. The parts of the end of the book before that was so focused on her loss of Leo that I didn’t *feel* convinced she would be happy with Grey though I know she was meant to

And what about her dad? Did they ever make amends? 
What in the world happened with Dinah?

Why didn’t Leo get to be the one to destroy Sage? That was his fight, not Liana’s. I also felt Leo should’ve shined more in that AI fight scene. I understand Liana is supposed to be the hero, but Leo has been an AI for much longer and is a protector. He should’ve had a lot of passion behind this battle. He’s festered on Pine for hundreds of years and those were his brothers and sisters. 

The AI fight didn’t make sense. We were told the simulation wasn’t real, but the fight was, or at least the obvious outcome. Was that Liana’s neural clone or her that was fighting? Was Liana aware of it if it was her neural clone? It only makes sense that it would be her neural clone. I feel like the author was rushing the ending and got things confused and didn’t explain things well. 

Where did Liam and Tian end up? 

It would’ve been good to see Leo accepting Lily. Liana accepting Grey. Grey accepting himself and genuinely all of them being happy. We had SO much inner monologue the whole series just to blow it off in a summary in the epilogue? If anytime was the time to dump inner monologue and passionate scenes… it was at the end. 

Also, as for Sage… as soon as Liana gave him the plastic surgery magazines, I feel like he would’ve attacked her. Like… that should’ve been a given. Sage wasn’t an idiot. 
Then once the DNA was ran… Sage still stood behind, underestimating Liana? Doesn’t make sense to his character considering the amount of people he’s just killed to make things work out. A 300 year plan to be thrown out because he just thought she was nothing to worry about? Hmmm.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/164zp76/ending_to_the_girl_who_dared_series/,2023-08-30T00:33:06Z,1,6,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

The idea is good but the execution did not live up to expectations. The writing is mediocre and the plot is unintentionally silly.

ujssys,The dark and bizarre horror of Thomas Ligotti.,"A few years ago I picked up a copy of the Penguin Classics publication of Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe by Thomas Ligotti. Essentially reissues of his first two short story collections released way back in the eighties. I had become aware of this book for a little while and initially had it on a wish list.

At first glance the book promised to be a collection of horror stories by the author, and when I eventually started reading it, I was not disappointed. Poe and Lovecraft are obviously the main influence in Ligotti's stories, as is the influence of Franz Kafka as well, but the stories are all him. It's impossible to compare stories like ""The Frolic"", ""The Nyctalops Trilogy""  and ""The Last Feast of Harlequin"" to anything written by Poe or Lovecraft, Ligotti's two primary influences.

They have a very disturbing quality about them that's hard to describe. Almost impenetrable even. And really, really good! Sometime later I would later pick up a copy of another of his short story collections titled Teatro Grottesco, which features the short story of the same name. There are other works written by him I have yet to get my hands on which includes My Work is not yet Done and Noctuary.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ujssys/the_dark_and_bizarre_horror_of_thomas_ligotti/,2022-05-06T17:36:34Z,12,52,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
y0obv2,All the Names by Jose Saramago,"TW - suicide 

Anyone else read this book? What did you think? I grabbed it at random in my library since it was the only Saramago book they had, and it’s my first I’ve read by him. I read some goodreads reviews and found some of them pretty amusing with how much they hated the dialogue style, it was definitely a little more of an exhausting read at times but it didn’t really put me off. 

I think a lot of it has probably gone over my head but I wanted to know what other people got out of this book. Last night I was thinking about it, wondering if I agreed with the idea that honoring someone who has passed away is even more meaningful if you never knew them. I’m not sure if I really feel that way, but it’s interesting. 

It made me think of social media a bit, how he collects all these celebrities details and what not, but then he becomes focused on the random woman. It reminded me of a post I read on a depression forum. It was a suicide note. It only had a few minor details about the person but it broke my heart. 

I ended up trying to find news stories to see if he really did it when he never replied to my messages. I just kept trying different searches, nothing ever came up. I do hope he is alive. I wish I knew, even though I have no idea who he is. The random woman in the book committed suicide too. I guess I’m not entirely sure what my point in this post is. I just made this connection last night, and wanted to see if anyone wanted to talk about this book.  Btw- sorry if this post sucks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y0obv2/all_the_names_by_jose_saramago/,2022-10-10T19:56:17Z,5,8,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
kb0k5r,Why do people say The Godfather is a better movie than book?!,"Edit: Spoiler warning 

I recently read The Godfather, I’d had a copy for ages and had never read it, nor seen the film. I recently read the book and was hooked, absorbed and couldn’t put it down. Yes there are some more graphic scenes around Sonny’s “organ” and Lucy’s surgery and the side plots with Johnny Fontane and Nino go well of tangent but this was enthralling. Start to finish was fantastic. I definitely found myself wishing Puzo would “get to it” a little bit I was almost heartbroken when I’d finished it and want to read it again. 
I’m now on The Sicilian with plans to read The Last Don, Omertà and Fools Die (at least) as Puzo creates an underworld and drops you right in it. 

Sure some of the ideas are “old fashioned” but I don’t read a book set in the 40s and expect anything less. 

I watched the film last night and I wasn’t blown away, I understand it’s generally considered to be far superior than the book. Monuments characters like Luca Brasi are brushed over, the immensity of the horses head is lost without the build up of the “fortress” image of the stables and Bonasera’s panic when Hagen calls him is lost. Puzo tells the story phenomenally and the film is less subtle and harder to follow (somehow). Yes I enjoyed the film but I don’t see why people think it’s far superior. I will watch part II & III as the movie buff in me has too but I’m far more excited by the prospects of devouring Puzo’s other work in literature. 

Anybody else feel this or care to engage in a discussion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kb0k5r/why_do_people_say_the_godfather_is_a_better_movie/,2020-12-11T10:47:40Z,39,26,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
uo0n9f,"Please give the book ""Momo"" by Michael Ende a try","I just finished reading the book for the third time in my life and it is such a gem.  
It seems as if not too many people know about this book, that has been written by the author of ""The Neverending Story"", and I truly wish that more people, especially adults, read this book.

It was written with the intent of being a children's book but I think that only as an adult one can truly understand the book and its message(s) in their entirety.  


I struggled to write a summary without spoiling too much, so I am going to insert a nicely written synopsis that I found on an [online blog](https://blog.mugglenet.com/2013/01/book-review-momo-by-michael-ende/).  


"" Momo is the name of a little girl who has no parents or guardian. She does not go to school. She does not live in an orphanage or foster home. In fact, Momo lives in the space under the stage of an old, ruined amphitheatre outside an unnamed Italian city. Her only food and home furnishings are things other people have brought her. And all she gives them in return is a listening ear. But that is enough. Momo is so good at listening that it almost qualifies as a magical gift. Grown-ups come to her, pouring out their problems and their conflicts, and – without Momo saying a word – go away knowing what they have to do. Boys and girls come to Momo’s amphitheatre to play, knowing that each game they invent while Momo is there will be better than the last.

But then the gray men come, men with gray cars, gray suits, gray briefcases, and gray cigars. The gray men are time thieves, swindling the good folk of Momo’s city – man, woman, and child – out of all their time for rest, joy, imagination, and friendship, and leaving them with nothing but hustle and bustle, worry and crabbiness. When Momo’s listening skills enable her to see through – I mean hear through – the gray men’s scheme, she becomes their enemy in a conflict that could save or destroy time itself, and all life with it.""

&#x200B;

This book is a gem. It's heartwarming and philosophical, its characters are fleshed out wonderfully and it has an original storyline that (as an adult) makes you rethink the life you are living.

8d4s29,"Just finished ""The Time Machine"" by H.G. Wells","Hi guys! So I am new to this subreddit, but just finished the book and haven't seen tons of discussion on it here. I am hoping it is okay to post stuff like this. Some backstory, I am pregnant and often in bed, which is why I decided to start reading some classics. Here are some thoughts on this one. Feel free to discuss or whatever (again I am new here): 

-First, I am shocked at how old this book is. I believe it was published in 1895. I would say it has aged extremely well, and gave me chills at many points. The ""time travelling"" portions at the end were particularly powerful.

-I liked the two evolved species (or I suppose they were two subspecies), The Eloi and the Morlocks. It is interesting to imagine how extremely different the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" would evolve. Overall, I wish I knew more about them, including when the Eloi ""cast their brothers out of the sun"" as the traveller says. I thought I would learn more about both societies when the traveller explores the museum-like building and was disapponted when I did not. I wish I knew more about how man got this way, but I suppose it also adds to the mystery. 

-Next that brings me to the traveller himself. I am not sure I like him. He comes across as arrogant at times, and I am not sure if this is intended by the author or is merely a symptom of the time he was writing male characters in. He hasn't been there for a few days before he decides that the Eloi are simple creatures (even when they are laughing at *him*) and the Morlocks are barbarians. Time and time again...I was hoping to for some plot twist to prove him wrong, but I never really got that.

-On a related note, I found the traveller's conclusions about the society (first that the Eloi are a perfect society, then that the Morlocks are the Eloi's slaves, and lastly that the Eloi were actually livestock for the Morlocks) interesting. It still speaks a lot for society today. However, I found myself wishing that the reader got confirmation that this was true. In fact, the traveller mentions that this is merely a theory himself. He could be completely wrong. Maybe this also adds to the mystery.

-My favorite character was little Weena. Upon doing a Google search, I found that Weena is often portrayed as the traveller's love interest in movies. I can definitely see this, but I am not entirely sure if he traveller feels this way or if he thinks of her as some sort of ""pet."" Either way, I thought it was powerful that Weena's flowers were the only items he had proving his tale was true, as if she was the one genuine part of his journey. I was really upset at her ending. I don't think it was fair. I like to think that the traveller went back in time in part to be with her, even if he met her in a different timeline.

-Okay so the last part of the book is terrifying and awesome, where he basically decides to keep jumping into the future to see what happens. The crabs and moths the earth is inhabited with are disturbing. I suppose we are to believe they are the descendents of the Eloi and the Morlocks? If so, why did they evolve this way? What is that saying about man? Utterly terrifying.

Another powerful and subtle device in the end is the sun, and how its appearance changes as the earth is coming to an end. I am not a science person, but it certainly seemed like a dying world to me.

For the last part of this point, I thought that the last creature he sees before the earth ends, the black blob thing, was extremely creepy and again, powerful. Are we supposed to believe this is the last descendant of man? If so...wow...I have so many questions. 

-I found the end to be double-sided. On one hand, the book takes a pessimistic, decayed stance on the evolution of man. On another, the time traveller does go back (or forward) and the story ends on the hopeful note of Weena's flowers as a gesture of kindness. Again, so many questions. Adding onto the layer of mystery is the fact that the narrator is unknown to us. What is going *on* here? I loved it.

Overall I loved this book, although I wish some parts were fleshed out more. I have been thinking about it non-stop since I finished it last night, so thanks for letting me vent! I may try ""War of the Worlds..."" or something entirely different. I also just read ""The Old Man and the Sea."" I have a while to go until this baby comes, so I have some reading to do.

oemnz4,The Innocents by Michael Crummy,"Has anyone read this? I finished last night. It’s about two orphans living in 18th century Newfoundland. 

Had a pit in my stomach practically the entire time I spent reading it. It made me emotional and was quite disturbing at times. But overall, it just evoked this sense of sad sympathy for Ada and Evered, like I wished I could sit them down and talk to them, teach them about life and shelter them from it. 

This was a fantastic read, but at the same time I almost wish I could erase it from my mind. I can’t say I’d recommend to everyone, but if you don’t mind a gritty, unfortunate story, you might well enjoy this one. Also, you might want to keep a dictionary of Newfoundland English handy. Here’s a link to one if anyone’s interested.

rg393v,Just finished The Stranger/Outsider by Albert Camus,"I recently finished reading Camus' *L'Étranger*. I had heard that the manner in which he wrote this book consisted of simple, short sentences, but I was unaware of the effect that such elementary language could have in its ability to portray absurdist philosophy. Notwithstanding his plain language, perhaps the most striking - and most confusing - chapter of the book was the last, which I will surely have to reread to understand completely, or to gain in it at least some further insight. What perplexes me most is Meursault's thoughts of escape and his fantasies, so to speak, of situations involving the failure of the guillotine, both of which would lead to his (temporary) exemption from death. His character in this final chapter seems to sway from that which he has embodied throughout the entirety of the preceding chapters, one of nonchalance and something resembling ""it would be no different if this were to happen than that."" Moreover, although he had cared little for what others thought of him, it still seems to me that he had preferred that people like him, or at least that they don't dislike him. Yet, the famous last words of this novel display exactly the opposite, for now he wishes - for which reason, I can only point to madness - that people ""greet \[him\] with cries of hate"" at his execution. Am I even correct in my pointing out this seeming difference in character? If so, what causes this change? I don't believe it is only madness - that would be too simple a cause for such a writer as Camus.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rg393v/just_finished_the_strangeroutsider_by_albert_camus/,2021-12-14T08:47:08Z,17,20,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
uk82qx,Anyone here who loves Kingdom of the Wicked by Kerri Maniscalco?,"Last March, I decided to buy this book in my nearby bookstore. The plot about Emilia being whisked into the world of Wrath through her desire for avenging her sister's death fascinated me. I was really entertained about the stories that Nonna told them about the demons, as I have always had curiosity over demonology. And oh, how I rejoiced when Wrath himself came along. Like many of you, I've got quite a thing for the enemies to lovers trope, so I was at the edge of my seat when he appeared. Hearing Emilia's narration makes the whole book so dreamy, and it makes me wish that I lived in Italy with her and was a streghe like her.

leg6c2,"My view on ""The Witcher"" series.","So, I'll be frank. I've struggled to find High Fantasy books that are for me. I enjoyed reading the Redwall books by Brian Jacques as a kid even up to now! Another favorite is the Percy Jackson books and the Mythoverse stuff by Rick Riordan. However, when it comes to High Fantasy, I've yet to find a book that SPEAKS to me. One that would leave me wanting for more. I try to get into Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien but I find that his style is a bit too tedious for me. I also attempted Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin but again, I couldn't get past ten pages.

Then, I played the Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt during my Community College years (I'll be starting my upper division years at a CSU this Fall). I've fallen in love with the game the first time I played it. I'm currently in my second playthrough! So when I found out it's based on a series of books by a Polish writer named Andrzrej Sapkowski, I immediately wanted to jump in. I just finished The Last Wish, a collection of short stories starring Geralt of Rivia, introducing me to the world. I have to say--I've fallen in love with this world. 

There's just something about it I adore. Is this a recurring theme for Central and Eastern Europeans?  Fantasy for the most part mostly follows A Hero's Journey trope. In the Witcher books, it feels more like a fairy tale... a twisted, dark fairy tale. Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter, is for the most part a noble character, but is reviled by the people of Temeria. A lot of the cases he deals with are killing monsters, getting rid of curses, and whatnot. I'm currently reading Sword of Destiny, then I'll be starting the main Witcher novels. Are there fantasy books that are like the Witcher books?

ehlh8u,Anyone find The Witcher series overrated? (Spoilers),"Edit: I write all that just to be downvoted, I'm guessing because people disagree?

I've finished the first 5 (Last Wish, Sword of Destiny, Blood of Elves, Times of Contempt and Baptism of Fire)

They have their moments, I particularly like the episodic nature of the first two books / short story collections, but they weren't perfect.

I find the whole destiny / child surprise narrative to be incredibly force. I guess Destiny is something people in this world truly believe (and is perhaps real), but that doesn't mean I like it. It just feels like a cheap way to set up the Geralt / Ciri relationship. They hardly know each other but behave like they have a deep bond so quickly. It's the main thing driving Geralt's actions and it's so hard to accept.

The same goes for Geralt and Yen. Their relationship seems incredibly immature and toxic. Reminds me of a teenagers idea of love. Geralt turns into an embarrassing and moody schoolboy around Yen. I guess the wish is the reason for this, they're not meant to or would have had a relationship if not for it, but it's a painfully embarrassing and, frankly, boring relationship to read.

Some of the dialogue is quite bad too. This is mostly in the first to books. Characters would have these awkwardly worded conversations, or monologue at another character. I might be less lazy and edit this with a few examples down the track. 

The story has its moments where it grips me, but then just managed to be immensely boring for the most part. The beats are fine, but it just somehow seems to unravel so slowly. At the end of Times of Contempt I was shocked how little has happened in 600+ pages between the first two of the pentology.

Geralt has borderline anti-plot armour. For our super powered mutant he sure gets his ass kicked a lot. This wouldn't be a problem, except we see him pull of some absurd feats at other times. It'd be like watching Muhammad Ali lose every 3rd fight to a hobo.

I guess a minor complaint given how frequently this occurs in fantasy, but magic is so OP yet the characters underutilize it like crazy. They use spell Y when spell X could have worked ten times better. Teleporting seems to be forgotten from time to time. A really simply example of conjuring food. They do it so effortlessly. They could just conjure a ham sandwich to appear in anyones throat to kill them, instead they used slow ranged spells that can be dodged. A mage blinds Geralt effortlessly. Why didn't any other mage just blind any other non magic attacker in combat. Should be your go to opener. It's like in Star Trek where they solve a problem with some new tech, then it never comes up again.

Lastly, the best part of the first two books, Geralt HUNTING MONSTERS is pretty much removed from the pentology (so far). I guess it would hurt the pacing, but it's a shame, it was kind of like Sherlock Holmes short stories but with monsters instead. Fun to read.

ydlzy7,(Spoilers)Stephen King's Later is perhaps one of the worst books I have ever read in my life,"I'm not a big fan of Stephen King's work. Up until this point, I have only read his book \* Cell \*, parts of the book \*The Shining\*, saw \*The Shining\* movie(didn't really like it), and now I have read \*Later\*. \*Later\* is a recently released novel of his that is apart of his Hard Case series of books. Though, there are some elements of horror spread throughout(But more on that later).

The book follows Jamie Conklin, a boy who has the power to see dead people and can extract the truth from them. He lives with his mother who runs a business publishing books while his Uncle Harry lives in various care facilities having contracted early-onset Alzheimer's. Jamie ends up having to use his powers to solve a case involving someone who plans on killing a lot of people from beyond the grave. However, solving the case causes a lot more trouble for Jamie than he originally anticipated(But more on that later).

While it may sound interesting, the book is anything but. Most of the time, the story is about Jamie as a pre-teen dealing with his life situations with the dead-body-viewing taking up a small portion of the book. The main conflict that the book presents, the case regarding the killer, gets resolved within two of the books 50+ chapters. The characters in this book are also not that interesting aside from Mr. Burkett who I wished we got to see more of(But more on that later).

A few other weird things I uncovered reading this book: the main killer's ghost apparently gets supernatural powers for no exact reason, the character Liz Dutton suddenly turns evil without much buildup, there's at least one or two spelling errors, and perhaps the weirdest thing in the entire novel happens in the last few pages where we are revealed who Jamie's father actually is. The ending regarding who Jamie's father is is so...awful. I felt that Stephen King could have done literally ANYTHING else but what he did regarding Jamie's dad(But more on that later).

Overall, I did not like this book whatsoever. The last few chapters did hold my attention pretty well, but the overall story I feel is pretty weak. Come to think of it, I may just not like Stephen King's work. I still have not read any of his most famous works like \*Carrie\* or \*It\*, but if they are anything like \*Later\*, then I may just end up not wanting to read them(But more on that later).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ydlzy7/spoilersstephen_kings_later_is_perhaps_one_of_the/,2022-10-26T01:58:14Z,26,0,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
iwq8fj,The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman," 

A little background story for why this book is so important to me: 

6 years ago, I lived on main street in my hometown. I was just a 10 minute walk away from the local book store. Being the girl whose head was always stuck in a book, I would walk there frequently, giving all my money to this independent book store. I got to know the owner pretty quickly. It was my senior year of high school, so we talked a lot about how I was moving away from my hometown of 18 years. The last day I was in town, I visited the bookstore. The owner said ""I have something I want to give you"" and she pulled this short, little fantasy book off the shelf. 

It always meant so much to me that she did that. I had made a connection and this book was the manifestation. I will never forget this. 

And you know what, I went to visit this book store a year later and she no longer remembered me. Keep this story in mind while I talk about the actual book now--

I loved this fantasy book. This time I read it 6 years after my first reread. Funny enough, it was EXACTLY 6 years after my first time. September 19th, 2014 I finished it the first time, and September 19th, 2020, I finished for the 2nd time. 

I always forget how quick this book is. It's short, and self-contained. What I really enjoy about the book itself is the fantasy rules--nothing is explained and nothing has to be. The world just exists, and it's perfect being told from the mind of the 7 year old. He is experiencing this world the same way we are. It's new and you just have to go along for the ride. 

Speaking of the narrator, I feel like so many of us can connect to him. He's a boy whose world is full of books. While he doesn't have a bad life, it seems like he has trouble fully connecting with people, until Lettie Hempstock. 

I absolutely ADORE the Hempstock family. They are the grandmothers everyone wishes they had. They are strong and confident. They are always there when you need them most. I honestly would love to live on their farm. This connection with Lettie finally lets us see a little more into the mind of our narrator. He finally has someone who will just let him be himself. He was able to grow just a little. That is, until, Lettie is taken away from him.

This book left me with a heartbroken, melancholic feeling. The narrator will never truly remember Lettie and what she did. He will never be able to experience a full life because of the hole still left in his heart. The events of the book were seemingly random chaos that just happened to descend upon him. Even when he comes back to the funeral that frames the events of this book, he only remembers a couple things when on the Hempstock's farm--but then quickly forgets. 

Because of my own background with this book, this hit even harder. The owner of my hometown's bookstore didn't remember me. Couldn't remember how important her and her store was for me in a pivotal moment in my life. I don't know--maybe a Hempstock snipped time and sewed it back together. 

All I know is, time is fragile. Memory is weak, and people are amazing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iwq8fj/the_ocean_at_the_end_of_the_lane_by_neil_gaiman/,2020-09-21T00:49:23Z,52,380,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
ejxbbo,Rereading the Witcher books - impressions,"I used to be a fan of these books as a child, but never read them again after my teenage years, and I'm now in my 30s and have a lot more reading experience. 
I was curious if I would love them again and if I would find some more than just fun in them now.
In short yes and yes, and below is a more detailed account of my thoughts. 
I would love to get others' perspective, especially since this is currently the most popular reading material on Amazon (wow). So please share!

- As before, the short stories (first two books) really seem much better than the novels (the following 5 books) with the exception of the one with Regis and Milva
- This is the kind of wry, vulgar humor that I adore. I love the exorcism joke in The Last Wish.
- I'm reading in English this time, translated by Danusia Stok, and it does lose a lot of language humor and depth. Who translated your versions? How do you like it?
- there is definitely a domme vibe to Yennefer that went absolutely above my head the last time. I like her even more now:)
- I never noticed before but this IS definitely a dying world there and the parallels to our times are astounding, environmental context, war, discrimination, it's all there and not superficially either. All this bears a lot of meaning for both the heroes and the plot. At the same time it's all shown through dialogue and plot, not described in a straightforward way. A lot of things you have to guess and imagine and I think this is awesome
- while I used to identify with Ciri, I'm now more focused on Geralt and Yennefer and their quarrels and discussions struck a true chord, this is well done
- I like the raw masculinity of Geralt and how he tries to surpress it with literature and philosophy but it mostly doesn't work; what does though is fatherhood. This is super interesting to me
- likewise, parenthood is a major theme throughout the series. Starting with the striga, who was the king's daughter, with Nenneke, who is a mother figure, Calanthe, there are a lot of parents there and Yennefers dream of being a mother fits this theme

I could go on and on about impossible choices, choosing sides, realism, companionship etc but I'd rather read what other people have to say:)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ejxbbo/rereading_the_witcher_books_impressions/,2020-01-04T14:35:23Z,18,49,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
slld89,Ending a book is the best feeling in the world and I need to brag about it.,"I just read last page of the book series I have been looking at the cover for about (probably more) 7 years. It was always popping up in my field of view but I never cared to pick it up. Even when somewhen in my school life I discovered I like to read. I did not remembered about this book, even tho it was lying in the house, bought by my brother. 
AND YET
After so many years, after reading that ""THE END"" I feel like I ate the most ripe apple in my life, I fulfilled my dearest dream, I feel true happiness i my chest and weird sadness. I can't count many books on my account and I read quitle slow but with every book I feel wild pride and fulfillment, especially with this one. It is hard to describe how it feels and all I can do is to wish you the same extraordinary feeling after reading ""The end"". Feeling that makes you want to cast everything aside and enjoy that unique moment and warm in your chest.
If you had similar experiences feel free to share with them.


For informative purposes only, I am not recommending the title I want to answer simple question, title of the book is Eragon.

ksbxuj,I will never get over The Song of Achilles,"I just finished reading it and I feel like life has been drained out of me. A void within my heart. I don't know what to feel. I went into this already knowing the story of the Trojan war and also Achilles' story. I went into this knowing it's going to be tragic. Yet all the preparation couldn't save me from the fall as I read the final chapter. I have been bawling my eyes out a couple times early in the book, but it was nothing compared to the utter heartbreak at the end.

This book was an emotional roller coaster. The way Madeline Miller wrote of their love hit hard. The pureness of it all. Throughout the book, I kept sensing an impending doom. The signs and the prophecies which tell you so, yet I can't help but hope that there was another way. Another ending. I find myself wishing they could escape the war, escape the deaths and all that were written in the fates.

The most heartbreaking part for me is to see Achilles slowly driven mad. His anger and his pride increasing at every flip of the page. Everytime he does something bad, I remember the innocence that he once had. During the last chapter when Patroclus recounts his memories, I remembered the part where they were under Chiron's care. Both of them by the olive grove as Achilles talked about how there's no known hero who was happy. He said he would be the first because of Patroclus, and they both swore it. On the last page, this feels like a distant dream.

How much has this book affected you? I would love to hear of other people's thoughts and experiences. None of my friends read TSoA and I'm dying to exchange discussions about this book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ksbxuj/i_will_never_get_over_the_song_of_achilles/,2021-01-07T12:03:24Z,23,56,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
181cz7t,Shogun gave me what I missed the most in books,"!!!!!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've discovered about shogun recently when  the new film trailer dropped, I instantly was interested as I'm hooked on Japanese culture and learning actively Japanese. 

The book was a fire, intense, stressful to read, dramatic and tragic but also partially satisfying with a dry aftertaste. 

It's so strange that I didn't know that there was a book based on William Adam's life although a lot of fiction in shogun still it highlights a lot William's life, what I found satisfying is that in reality William Aka Anjin-san didn't loose his lover as ( spoiler alert) he did loose Mariko in the book, that was a shocking twist, and the twist of toronaga who had burnt Erasmus in order to keep the barbarian in Japan, I've rarely cried over a book, but I've been crying for quite a long time on this boon.

Now I'm filled with sadness as such a wonderful book came to it's end.


UPDATE : I posted this hours ago in full rush not knowing if people would actually relate to my feedback, Ive been trying to come to my senses since yesterday. This might be a bit long..


Finished the book quite late 3am and been crying for quite a bit and barely had any time to sleep before going to work, impacted my day, barely could concentrate on the work as been thinking about what I have just finished, of course I grinded a lot of info about the original historical figure that actually was a bit relaving.

Generally speaking I always hook on this kind of stories very easily, when the main character who partially represents my own persona goes into unknown  ( had strong feelings with the ""Dances with Wolves""novel/film"" too), it's resonating with my own background quite strongly, that's where the writer succeeded genuinely, Anjin was overwhelmingly expressive person with strong character that wasn't fitting into Japanese culture at first but his honourable and brave side pushed him really far, he's genuine, not open minded at first, kin to knowledge when his crewman were more of a simple kind, I personally been integrating into foreign countries since I was 15 when I abandoned my homeland, so cultural shock is real and it was perfectly represented here, I recall when I first arrived in France I was like 15 years old, I've been shocked how girls would talk, the insults, where in my country it was unimaginable, Shogun handled it perfectly, the pillowing part goddamn ! Been laughing for so long, this part "" maybe he prefers ducks, I heard garlick eaters pillow ducks sometimes"" some of the exchanges were hilarious, and it resonated so much with me it's more like I've been reading about my past self adventures.

Two things struck me hard.

Strangely the Sono's death, the maid, and it's really sad how briefly her death was explained but still was quite terrifying, there's one of the few parts that I think I'd absolutely be broken when seeing such thing in the place of Anjin San who basically wasn't described as reacting in any way on that. 

Mariko's death wasn't as brutal in my opinion, but it hurts, so much, wasn't expecting for a happy ending but hell I cried, I cried a lot, big ass man but that shit hits hard, how much he cared, she was the only thing that made him consider to stay in Japan ( in my opinion) the only thing that helped him to soften the pain of the loss Is the fact that he understood, he's seen the honourable death, karma was it?.

Last thing that hits hard is the Mariko's letter, the 3th time I cried like a baby, I'd probably broke down completely if it was me having that experience and not Anjin-san, astonishingly beautiful love story, how much she cared, if not recalling wrongly I think that she even stated ( in her letter ) that she cared more for him than for anything or anyone else even toronaga himself she choose the barbarian over the ship.

I came also to the conclusion that our Brit hero also in a way saved Mariko and gave her a true happiness and meaning in life before she died, she was clueless about the ""love"" as it wasn't ( and perhaps still isn't ) one of main values of a Japanese culture and mostly to a samurai, as love was partially integrated in a duty in their mind, but even they knew that there was more than that, something extraordinary, but they couldn't express properly or describe it while Anjin felt, expressed, and gave love to Mariko, thus making him as a top priority in her's life. He saved her gave her a purpose, and she saved him sacrificed herself, brave, strong, smart, clever, beautiful woman, no, samurai she was, a strong female character that nowdays people are having hard times to interpret.

Still digesting, wish I could clean my mind and re-read it again, but wanna read it in Jap next time, tried already but still not good enough for such a book, gotta be patient and next year maybe will be able to read it in Jap.

Thanks for your kind suggestions I'll check them all.

qytaeq,What's your opinion on the Norman Denny translation of Les Miserables?,"I love the poetic elegance of this translation but Denny has been accused of inaccuracy lots of times, rightfully so I guess. I was surprised to learn that he changed the order of the last paragraph's sentences in the penultimate chapter. But here's the thing, I can't stand the other translations of Les Miserables. I've had the Fahnestock and McAfee for years but I never got past the first 50 or so pages. The Donougher, based on the numerous samples of it I've read, is simple and clear but I find it less engaging than the Denny.

10ipsc,Would you read the published journal of a long-dead author if you found out the author specifically stated before dying that she did NOT want the journal published?,"Okay, this needs a little explanation. I went to the library last week and checked out the published journals of an author who lived in the 19th century. After flipping through the book a little, I came across a photograph of a note written by the author some ten years before her death that specifically stated that her journals were for her personal reference only, and if she did not get a chance to destroy them before dying, she wanted them all to be destroyed unread or copied by anyone. I immediately felt like reading this book was wrong and invasive, so I put it down and haven't returned to it since. The way I see it, this author clearly did not want her journals read by anyone else, and I should honor that by not reading them. A friend of mine argues that, since she is an important historical figure, it is okay to go against her wishes so we can learn everything we can about her life. Upon further research, I found that this was a similar argument used by the publisher that eventually persuaded the author's living relatives to hand over the journals. 

Now I want to know what everyone else thinks. Would you read the journal of someone who died many years ago if you knew it was against that person's wishes?

EDIT: Thanks for the discussion, everyone! It seems like most redditors disagree with me on this subject, though you all showed up with different reasons for disagreeing. The count so far is as follows:

12bhl02,"Hamnet - Shakespeare’s existence, his family history, the legacy he left behind & the film adaptation","Due to the lack of spotlight on him in Hamnet, after finishing the book I was stuck in a loop of thinking about Shakespeare, his life and his family which made me go down the internet’s rabbit hole for more background information of the same. 

What I found most interesting was that he signed a will bequeathed to Susanna on the condition that she passes it to her male heir, but surprisingly none of her three children nor Judith ended up having kids of their own so the redundancy of his valid wish despite the extraordinary turnaround of his financial circumstances was ironic for me. 

The depiction of greatly grieving parents during the Elizabethan age - an era famous for kids being kept at arm’s length due to their imminent early demise was extremely heart wrenching. 

I learnt that there’s conjecture of Tom Holland starring in the film adaptation, I didn’t understand why he’d want to play a part which isn’t properly fleshed out in the book but the ending completely changed my mind. That last scene where Agnes sees him bring Hamnet back to life definitely has potential of it being an incredible acting experience for him. 

Literary scholars debating over Shakespeare’s existence surprised me. Most of their evidence is baseless in my opinion, because it revolves around his varied signatures, his formal education and him not mentioning his literary works in his will amongst others. Inconsistencies of authorship legitimacy cannot dismiss the idea of authorship in itself for we need to go by the proof we have and it largely falls in his favour. 

Albeit if legitimate, I think it is incredibly beautiful that he was able to revive Hamnet through his authorship by transforming his son’s premature loss as a way of memorialising him forever through art. I would definitely recommend Hamnet to any one who enjoys reading historical fiction despite not having prior familiarity to Shakespeare’s other works.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12bhl02/hamnet_shakespeares_existence_his_family_history/,2023-04-04T12:27:34Z,1,16,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
pd3p2x,To the Lighthouse by Viriginia Woolf,"This novel was wonderful. It was written with beautiful prose, creating vivid and sentimental images, teleporting you straight to the setting as if you were amongst the characters. The stream-of-consciousness style was really able to convey the isolation one could feel, even when being so physically close to others. 

It was a great feminist novel, in the sense that it expressed the self-doubt, value conflict and sacrifice women typically experience in a patriarchal world, stripping away the male gaze and perhaps giving men insight into the world of a woman; the seriousness of men, with their emphasis on work and prestige (and frankly, on themselves at times), being contrasted with the emphasis on social harmony and familial bonds placed by Mrs Ramsay (the star for me of the book) - but perhaps out of necessity.

There isn't much of a story, but just the development of characters in the face of grief, loss and displacement. It seems Woolf was Lily, who admired the maturity, composure and sacrifice of Mrs Ramsay; perhaps, something she wish should could emulate, but unable to do so for her strong feminist beliefs and desire for individuality.

Overall, the novel was short, beautiful but also sad and reflective. I felt the last 1/4 of the book could have been more cathartic, and the quality of the writing for me dropped noticeably; but that didn't take away from the novel as a whole.

I plan on reading more stream-of-consciousness books, and particularly some of Woolfs as she is incredibly talented.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pd3p2x/to_the_lighthouse_by_viriginia_woolf/,2021-08-28T05:04:01Z,17,49,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

14d4tpz,"Just read Journey under the midnight sun by Keigo Higashino, and I have too many questions!!!🤯","What was this book! There hasn't been a single book till date that made it impossible for me to forget, even for a moment, the characters in the book! Ryo! Yukiho! Their names kept ringing in my head, torturously, making it super difficult for me to sleep. I can't point to just one part or scene or event if you ask me what it was that bothered me so much! It was dark. But I was in awe of the novel and Keigo Higashino!

But I have my questions. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE REST OF YOU THINK OF IT. 

I read the English translation of the book, and was unable to find any satisfying conversations about the book. SAD! And reading stuff from blogs made it all the more confusing because there has been a television series too, apparently, where things are different from what's in the book! o.o

Here are my questions. Even ones with downright obvious answers. Just to be sure.

1. Imaeda says yukiho was in love with Kazunari. Was she? If she was, why would she have him demoted? If she wasn't, why was Eriko attacked?
2. Were Ryo and Yukiho in love all through the years? I ask because of the R&Y keychain. The R&Y store. What was their relationship? Did it ever go beyond the role of a protector?
3. Why did Ryo send Namie - the bank employee who helps them out with the game -
to her death?
4. Did Ryo ever love Noriko? Because it seemed to me that of all the characters he encounters, he seemed to open up - although only a little - to Noriko. 
5. What happened to Yuichi Akiyoshi? The last I saw him was when Muta attacks him. Did he die right then?
6. Why did Ryo take the alias of Yuichi Akiyoshi?

THERE ARE MANY MORE! BUT I STOP HERE!

Ryo and Yukiho were so twisted, really. So many murders - some of them uncalled for! But the way Higashino ended the novel, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the two, and almost wishing that they could start over and have the lives they were denied since they were kids! 💔",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14d4tpz/just_read_journey_under_the_midnight_sun_by_keigo/,2023-06-19T04:51:49Z,8,23,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
t9sxqg,The Red Queen Series,"So last night I finally finished the entire Red Queen series. I wasn’t sure if I would like it because I saw a couple of bad reviews, and in the beginning it reminded me of the Shadow and Bone series. But as I kept reading and reading, I just felt so captivated by the story and I couldn’t put it down and even had to make myself not finish one book before I got the next. 

I wish that love triangles would stop being a trope in books like this, but I have to admit, this one was more twisted than any others I’ve read.

When it started switching up to more point of views, I kind of did an eye roll, but was glad for the extra insight of other characters. 

I was a little disappointed in the end, not going to lie, but it was wrapped up quite nicely in my opinion. I somewhat can’t believe it’s over. This series that has kept my mind captivated over the course of what was probably a couple of months. 

Has anyone else read this series? Did you love it or hate it? I would just love to know someone else’s thought on it.

i721xc,Need help keeping track of things happening in the Witcher series.,"I just started reading ""The Last Wish"" by Andrzej  Sapkowski, and I intend to continue with the series.

The appendices and maps included in each book in A Song of Ice and Fire were a great help to me in this regard. Besides including detailed maps for the locations, they also included character descriptions and character relations without revealing any spoilers present in that particular book. Something similar to that would be really helpful.

That being said, if any pre-made maps/character wikis for the (preferably for individual) books are not present, I am willing to put in the work and create them as I proceed with the series and create one for myself.

qax91k,Nothing in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is funny at all (and the problem I have with British fiction),"I may be the only person who's said this publicly, but Hitchhiker's sucks. It's not that it couldn't be funny, taken out of context the adventure Arthur Dent goes on, it's gut-busting. It's absurdist and clever.

The problem is the book starts with the destruction of earth and the death of 5 billion people. Nothing is funny after that, and really nothing should. At first, years ago I thought Douglas Adams was some kind of high functioning Psychopath, incapable of feeling any warmth or pathos to his fellow man. 

But British storytelling seems to have this problem. I see it in the horrible Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy (and I have friends who groan when they hear Hardy and whisper their disgust of Tess of D'Ubervilles as though the memory punches them in the stomach) and then I look at other works like the Elite, Judge Dredd. enough Dr. Who episodes I saw at random to never want to touch the series again.

Modern British storytelling is cruel. It lacks any sort of pathos for the characters, and they don't act like real people. Arthur Dent I can give a pass too because his new circumstances are so surreal he can't process, but especially Judge Dredd, there's a whimsy around human suffering that makes me sick. And then to make the plot go forward, to make the plot happen at all, especially in Judge Dredd the people don't act like people. They're stupider, crasser, meaner, they become strawmen. The ""Bright Side of Life"" number at the end of Life of Brian comes to mind. It ruined the whole movie for me, but at least the ""whimsy"" came at the end of the work, and not the beginning. 

Now people have the audacity to say that these are works of satire and speculation and don't need to conform to realism, except that's not true when it comes to human characters, including background characters. It took me a LONG time to understand I hate British stories because it's very clear the authors do not like their characters and see them only as tools for their ends.

And if you want to see the difference in action, why do people weep for a loser antihero like Willy Lowman in Death of a Salesman? It's because Arthur Miller on some level LIKES Willy, and roots for him despite his inadequacies.

In short, while I have no desire to read French classics because they ALWAYS seem to give downer endings (absolute no no for me) at least they treat tragedy as a tragedy. French classics it seems bring sadness and judgment in how they treat the characters, but they are given dignity and humanness. British stories bring with them callousness and contempt and a sneer. 

I really want to take Doug Adams, were he alive and shake him by the shoulders. In what fucking world do you think you can have the human race slaughtered to all but last man and the Earth utterly destroyed, and have that be the opening of a COMEDY? What the fuck is wrong with you?!

I've spoken Caligula's line about how he wishes the world had but one throat so he could slit it, I tend to agree with Daniel Plainview's views of humanity. And British storytelling is shockingly misanthropic. I hate people when they are conceited jackasses, British storytellers seem to either hate or have no regard for humanity on principle. They leave me angry when I read them, because I cannot stand cruelty in any form, and these people are cruel gods to their characters. 

And honestly, I love Kipling (Kim) and Dickens (Tale of Two Cities) and Conan Doyle (Holmes). Sherlock Holmes is not my bag because of mysteries, but Doyle LIKES Sherlock, without sugarcoating what a dumpster fire he is as a human being. I find is scandalous British storytelling seems to take its notes from Hardy and not the guys above.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qax91k/nothing_in_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy_is/,2021-10-18T22:10:16Z,140,0,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

g84rrx,Mistborn:The Final Empire,"Mistborn:The Final Empire brought me back to fantasy

I have just finished Mistborn:The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson, and I am in love with the genre all over again. 

I read The Fellowship of the Ring by Tolkien last year, and while I enjoyed it, it didn’t make me feel as much as I would have liked. I was recommended Brandon Sanderson and the Mistborn trilogy and I am officially hooked!

One of my favorite things about the story is the story within a story with the few sentences at the beginning of each chapter. Each one brings a new aspect to the overall main storyline, but I find myself wanting to know more. I was shocked by the ending, but no spoilers here. 

The character development was amazing, to me. At first, I couldn’t figure out who the main character was...Kelsier or Vin, but I was cool with either one. I wanted to know more about each and what their motivations were. With Vin, it was easy to see where she started, but as she came into her own, I wanted to keep cheering her on! With Kelsier, each piece of his history that was revealed was a little nugget that made me want to keep digging. I wish there had been a bit more with Mare, but can see why that wasn’t explored more. 

For me, by far my favorite character was Sazed. I know he was an ancillary character, but he did so much to drive Vin forward in her development as a woman and as part of the revolution. In addition, his history is so fascinating! How his magic was different from Allomancy, but so similar. How he selflessly went searching for her when she needed rescuing. He just came alive for me. 

Marsh broke my heart. I felt so much for him, and the hurt he had experienced. I thought Sanderson did such a good job, in the few scenes he appeared in, describing his history and motivations. I’m really hoping his story is explored more in the remainder of the trilogy. 

This entire story really brought me back to the genre I am a huge fan of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g84rrx/mistbornthe_final_empire/,2020-04-26T00:36:25Z,50,31,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
yqv5o7,"Another book for the ""top best books of 2022"" with ""the seven husbands with evelyn hugo"".","In the last few months i got really curious with the ""booktoks"" books and (even if i've only read 2 or 3 this year) weeks ago i bought a book that i waited MONTHS to get my hands on. ""The seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo"" really intruiged me with the plot. It talks about a Hollywoodian celebrity named ""Evelyn Hugo"", she is an actress and she is known even for her past seven husbands. One day a girl named ""Monique"", that works as a Journalist had the chance to interview her, but the surprising part is that Evelyn Hugo doesn't want from her an interview, but an autobiography, where she talks about all her difficult life and, of course, all the seven husbands.

The ending of the story was well written, and it made me tear up a little.

But, in all of this, the book was narrated really well, and the plot twist really hit me well. It was hard to stop reading it because it is really dragging.

It really made me sad reading that in the end Celia just died after 10 months that her and Evelyn finally got ""married"". I wished they had much more time togheter.!<

I remember reading Game of Thrones the first time and rage quitting when Robb Stark was killed, but by the second read-through I was actually enjoying the evilness of the book and enjoyed the Red Wedding at a different level. Some of the characters I now wish were still alive include:

* Lord Tywin — One of the best bad guys ever written. 

* Sandor Clegane — I felt that The Dog was on the road to redemption and could have played a larger part in the story.

* Prince Oberyn — Some of the best dialogue in the book, although he's only in it for a short time. An interesting character that could have been developed more. 

What characters do you wish stuck around a little longer? Joffre? The Mountain? Greatjon Umber? Renly? Janos Slynt?

l5tn1p,The experience of reading a book as an adult versus as a kid,"I recently picked up Ender's Game again. Ender's Game was *that* book for me. It was assigned in my sixth grade reading class, and although the first chapter was assigned, I read the whole thing the first weekend. It introduced me to science fiction, but beyond that it completely engrossed me. Looking back, I remember the book being empowering and exciting. To be a child prodigy, to be shot into space to train for warfare, to be a champion in the battle room; all things I wished I could do. 

I pulled the book off the shelf for a re-read at age 30, and when I turned the last page I was soul-crushed. As an adult, the book is gut-wrenchingly sad. I'm not Ender anymore, I am a man watching this child from a distance. The isolation he experiences, the sense of duty without purpose, his lack of free will. There are themes that I couldn't see as a kid because I wanted to be Ender, I was Ender. More importantly, I lacked the maturity or experience to even recognize these themes.

2k31ol,Why Boromir is the best member of the Fellowship in the books and how his character is totally ruined in the films. [SPOILERS],"SPOILERS

Having spoken to a few people about this in the outernet, it seems I am the proud owner of a somewhat unpopular opinion. I am posting here because I am interested in the opinions of more bookish people rather than those whose main experience of LoTR is the film series.

I know I'm not alone in thinking Boromir was a pretty cool guy but where I feel slightly alone is in how much of a cool guy I think he was and why he's so cool. Let me explain. I'll get around to how much I hate what the film did to him nearer the end of this post (and it's not just because they made his ring-stealing antics look nasty. They were pretty bad.)

I think Boromir is the most sensible and critical yet the most brave and by a million miles the most noble of the fellowship. He has been the somewhat reluctant hero of a catastrophically besieged and relentlessly embattled people. His father, before he became too bitter to be of any use to anyone all but disowned Faramir but Boromir didn't lose any love or respect for his brother. With their father trying to drive a wedge between them, Boromir could easily have started to foster the same opinion as his father but he doesn't, he is magnanimous and loving.

Boromir, unlike Aragorn, has been suffering at the hands of the forces of evil for years right alongisde his people and risking his life for them frequently (while Aragorn has been fannying around in tights in the forest) and isn't driven by some prophecy or tradition. He carries the burden of one of the last bastions of hope on his shoulders and he does it manfully, courageously and humanely. I could go on but I'm sure this isn't something that escaped everyone's notice so I'll move on.

So then somebody tells him that there is an all powerful artifact he could use to defeat the dark lord. To be honest, he rightfully does feel like the person to whom this should be entrusted because he has selflessly led the battle against the darkness for a very long time. Then someone tells him that a skinny, stinky tramp from the forest should be the one to save the world?? Let's think about these characters as if they were humans. How would we feel? Crucially I think, despite all the influences that doubtless could have made him so, Boromir still isn't vainglorious. He IS the last defender of humanity and is being faced with the prospect of someone telling him, after many tragic, apocalyptic years, that some people who have never even seen an orc, intend to take the one thing that may be able to save the world from destruction away. I know this is hardly a subtle conflict in the book so I don't think I'm saying anything groundbreaking here but I am driving at the sum of my explanation being something discussionworthy. 

Here comes the reason he is so noble. He goes along with it!! He doesn't seize the ring, or refuse to play if they're not going to let him have it. He doesn't go home *against his better judgement* he follows  the fellowship to lend his skill as possibly the best known warrior in Middle Earth to protect the ringbearer on a quest he believes may end in disaster. We could say here that he always intended to take the ring forcibly but I don't believe that's the case, personally. His eventual near defection comes from a combination of his deep grief at the plight of his people and most importantly the ring's supernatural power.

Anyway, moving not so swiftly on. I think Boromir is by far the most human character. Not being a fantasy person usually (I did love LoTR though) absolutely nothing about Aragorn's 'destiny' really pushed any buttons for me at all. I always saw him as a moody opportunist who favoured old tales and whimsy over hard work and pragmatism. The fact that he was 'right' being a quirk of the fantasy genre and I realise that fantasy is all about old tales a whimsy. Boromir's humanity made him seem all the more brave and noble to me.

On to why one line in the films makes me almost hate them. ""I would have followed you, my brother... my captain... my king."" I can't stand that line. I hate it. In contrast with his final utterance in the book it changed his personality, his character and perhaps counter intuitively, I think for the worse. 

His final words in the book are as follows:  'I tried to take the Ring from Frodo ' he said. 'I 
am sorry. I have paid.' His glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty 
at least lay there. 'They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have taken 
them. I think they are not dead. Orcs bound them.' He paused and his eyes 
closed wearily. After a moment he spoke again. 
'Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! I have failed.' 

In the book he was never, and should never have been, I don;t think, part of Aragorn's weird personality cult. In the book his concern is for the safety of the Hobbits he died trying to defend and the people that he believes in his dying moments he has failed. The film line might SEEM more selfless but I don't think it is. It makes him look weaker, his convictions look less important and sensible and his concerns more about a man he barely knows and has never fully trusted rather than the unfathomable weight of literally saving all the free people in the world that has been put on his shoulders and he, tragically, feels he has dropped. He dies thinking about everything he has been expected to save and how he has failed, not about how much he loves a man he has never even seen eye to eye with. In the book: Tragic, harrowing, ever-noble, selfless. In the film: Sycophantic, weak and senseless. 

I know a lot of people like Boromir, I know he is often seen as a tragic hero, I'm not saying I have hit on anything new there. But I hate the sheer weakness displayed in him in the films when really he was by orders of magnitude the longest-suffering and strongest of all the characters, possibly the longest-suffering and bravest man in all Middle Earth.

TL;DR - Boromir is misunderstood, boohoo. I can't really briefly sum up what I was talking about so see above and stick it out if you are interested in talking about our friend old Bozzer.


EDIT: I'm not going to rephrase my original post because that seems dishonest but I'm sorry about bashing Aragorn! I was trying to be somewhat lighthearted in saying that all he had done was ""fanny about"" in the forest. I have only read the novels but I got the impression that his work as a ranger allowed him more ""breathing room"" and he had been fighting evil off-and-on for a time and mostly gathering intelligence with the Dunedain. He has also been acting with the knowledge that Gondor stands between Middle Eart and destruction. I would contrast that with Boromir who knows little to nothing about the shadowy war that the Dunedain are fighting and from the moment he was old enough to know what's what he has believed that the fate of the entire world depends on him... that's some pretty stressful shit right there...

EDIT 2: And another thing! I forgot to add another of my points. Regardless of what Aragorn has been doing or not, Boromir knows very little about it or him. Him and his ancestors have been fighting and dying in the defence of Gondor for generations and then this man arrives and says ""Thanks a lot for devoting your lives to the fanatical defence of the freedom and lives of your people but... they are actually my people. I'll be taking that throne back now, my loyal subject."" Imagine being Boromir!! That must take some swallowing however noble you are.

EDIT 3: Thanks everyone for wading in to the discussion! If I may I'll just add some things that you have made me think about that I never had before, which is the great thing about talking about stuff!

Someone pointed out that Boromir represents the military element of the fellowship. I think this is very good analogy. We could have him symbolise the military because he believes in the power of might, the importance of duty and crucially the protection of those who can't defend themselves.  I think he is fighting to protect people rather than ideals, for actual beings who look up to him rather than for ideas. I think Boromir could exhibit the finest traits we like to believe a military officer would possess. Having been an army reserve officer myself maybe this is why I like him so much. (I'm not saying I posses his qualities, I would like to have done though!)

With Tolkein having been an army officer in wartime I assume he will have seen the best that military commanders could be in the field. Brave over and above the call of duty, fatherly, leaderly, protective, sacrificial, staring suffering and death in the face and having the protection of others still foremost in his mind. Tolkein also would presumably have seen the worst that happens when a military commander with little knowledge of the nuances of a complicated conflict get to make decisions just based on their military prowess or experience. I think it's really interesting to see Boromir as a highly decorated and undoubtedly ideal military officer in some respects but showing the tragedies that can result when essentially flawed men (as everyone is) have superhuman trust put in them.

One more thing I'd like to add is the prevalence of the opinion that Boromir is the most human character. Of course he literally is in terms of races in the book, but he is also the most like us in many ways. A lot of people have said that maybe we would make the same decisions he does faced with the situation he is and I believe that, too. I think we can love Boromir for him being the most relatable but showing in a lot of ways what we all wish we could be, confident, brave, able, in a position where we can save the lives of others. He seems protective, fatherly and concerned about other people. We can love him for his humanity.

We can also hate him for his humanity because he shows what even the best of us can be like, corruptible, single minded. Maybe over simplistically he is the best and the worst in us whereas the other characters don't feel like us. I love him for this, I think he shows a lot more best than worst.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2k31ol/why_boromir_is_the_best_member_of_the_fellowship/,2014-10-23T10:32:26Z,313,1096,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
dubo3h,Does anyone find fiction less enjoyable the more they age?,"I use to be easily impressed when I was a teenager. It’s embarrassing to say but I use to love twilight when I was 12 and it’s what got me into reading. And when I was 13 I fell in love with Harry Potter like everyone else. For the majority of my high school life I only read YA, but suddenly I stopped enjoying it when I was around 17. I just couldn’t relate anymore. I was no longer impressed with the storylines and I couldn’t stand the romance, so I moved on to classics and other genres. I enjoyed Jane Eyre, Wuthering heights, North and South, The Counte of Monte Cristo, To Kill a mockingbird and so on. 

However, I become less and less impressed with classics and other genres in only a few years. I didn’t enjoy Dracula, Rebecca, Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, 1984, their eyes were watching god, lord of the flies, the strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde. It’s not that I found them boring. It’s that none of them have impressed me and I feel like I’ve wasted my time reading them. If I’m not impressed with the book then it wasn’t a good reading experiencing for me. I’ve read variety of other genres, but none of them have impressed me either. I’ve read Sharp objects by Gillian Flynn and it was laughably bad. The secret history by Donna Tart was nothing impressive as well. I was mildly impressed with the first book of the Mistborn trilogy, but the second one was a disappointment. The last books that impressed me and;therefore, I found enjoyable were Frankenstein and Gulliver’s travel. They were something new and different from what I’ve read before. I’m currently reading Robinson Crusoe. It’s interesting but I’m still not impressed. 

I’ve nearly lost my passion for reading and the only thing that keeps me reading is non-fiction, but I can’t read a lot of non-fiction because the books are so expensive and my library rarely carries the non-fiction books I want. I don’t really enjoy reading on my ipad or kindle. I sometimes wish I had the mind of a teenager again so I can enjoy reading again without being so extremely critical of every book I read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dubo3h/does_anyone_find_fiction_less_enjoyable_the_more/,2019-11-10T13:52:26Z,71,0,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
e8i022,Sorry but i need to complain about ‘The Wheel of Time’ series,"I apologise in advance, since English is not my native language.
Well, I’m currently reading the fourth book of the series and I’ve really loved the story so far. There is a couple of things though, that keeps recurring on the narration, that upsets me to a point I’ve decided to stop here: 

1-people continuously blushing for apparently no reason or very weak ones, as if they were immature little children, and it seems the author really love to focus on that point, it’s like he really can’t avoid it.

2-Narration being increasingly filled with veiled sexual hints, heroes having repressed sexual desires all the times that are never satisfied for some strange reason, once again as if they were immature little children. Also, the author so often trying to give badly hidden sexual clues, it’s really unbearable to me. For example (the last thing i read that made me decide to quit), there have been a princess with an almost transparent dress, and the narration at some point says that Egwene wishes to have the same dress, because it would be fresher in the warm nights to wear. In this case, the way it is narrated makes it is so obvious that it is said so that the reader thinks to the transparent dress being worn by Egwene and gets excited about it.

Why ruining such a wonderful plot with these stupid things?? Somebody else has noticed this and is upset by it, or is it just me??

slyccn,On The Move: Oliver Sacks: A beautiful and candid memoir of a passionate neurologist whose words have given me many ideas to think about...,"“When I was twelve, a perceptive schoolmaster wrote in his report, “Sacks will go far, if he does not go too far,” and this was often the case.”

And in such a fashion Oliver starts his tale. By the end we know he has gone too far, in the most incredible way possible.

Writing, he mentions, has always been a source of joy for him and he kept journals since the age of 14. One can sense his wonder and curiosity at the world- he had many hobbies- swimming, botany, organic chemistry, weight lifting, motorbikes that he gave proper attention to and those things shaped him as much as his profession- he overcame his timidity and fears and developed more frameworks to understanding the world. Example: he had a sense of powerlessness as a child and therefore wanted a powerful motorbike.

&#x200B;

>*I am a storyteller, for better and for worse. I suspect that a feeling for stories, for narrative, is a universal human disposition, going with our powers of language, consciousness of self, and autobiographical memory.*

I found Oliver's story of coming out the world especially moving- few of his partners were themselves in denial and confusion given the orthodoxy of those times, his mother's callous words upon finding out "" I wish you had never been born.” If he has a gripe with her, he never mentions it. His celibacy for \~35 years after he turned 40, his story of meeting Billy, his new partner, when he's almost 75, it was all very moving, I could sense the pain, but one can only imagine how difficult that experience would have been for him... Life is always so bittersweet.

There is a scene which left me in tears- he is travelling on a ship and Eric, the person accompanying him, can't find him anywhere, and goes wild with panic. Upon seeing Eric's reaction, Oliver is astonished and exclaims as follows:

>“You care, you really care for me!”  
>  
>“Of course,” Eric said. “How could you doubt it?”  
>  
>But it was not easy to believe that anyone cared for me; I sometimes failed to realize, I think, how much my parents cared for me. It is only now, reading the letters they wrote to me when I came to America fifty years ago, that I see how deeply they did care. And perhaps how deeply many others have cared for me—was the imagined lack of caring by others a projection of something deficient or inhibited in myself? I once heard a radio program devoted to the memories and thoughts of those who, like me, had been evacuated during the Second World War, separated from their families during their earliest years. The interviewer commented on how well these people had adjusted to the painful, traumatic years of their childhood. “Yes,” said one man. “But I still have trouble with the three Bs: bonding, belonging, and believing.” I think this is also true, to some extent, for me.”

In Billy's book ""Insomniac City: New York, Oliver, and me"", he mentions that for this book, he asked Oliver to try and use a different word instead of that big one which many may not be able to get at a go and Oliver replied: ""let them think, let them learn something new.""

Ah, my mad, mad heart...

And of course clinical research was a major part of his life but his other works dive into that aspect in more detail. This memoir weaves all the multitudes Oliver contained into one incredible tale in an honest and forthright manner, letting the readers draw their own conclusions. My conclusion was that I loved it. I was deeply saddened to know that he is no more with us.

*“Life must be lived forwards but can only be understood backwards.”*

szbu2y,The Icemark series,"If any one of you has read ""The Cry of the Icemark"" by Stuart Hill, you'd probably go back again and again... I've re-read the first one a few times, 2nd one 2, maybe 3, times, and now going through the 3rd for my first time. Each time I see the words ""Blood! Blast! And fire!"" I yell it in my head, with fist pumps, and a proper fighting face on. These books very much bring you in with drama, suspense and moments of laughter. The characters are very well written, very relatable. With Thirrin Freer Strong-In-The-Arm Lindenshield, Oskan Witches-Son, Grismak, Scipio Bellorum, as well as the other allies that the Icemark needs, it is hard to forget them all.

6rykln,"After reading the Glass Castle, what are your thoughts on Maureen?","Before I had even read a page of the book, I already had a weird feeling about the author's relationship with Maureen simply because of the dedications written before the first chapter. The author speaks at length about the support and understanding of her brother, older sister, and mother - and then says ""To my younger sister Maureen, whom I will always love.""

Seemed to me like maybe the author was estranged from Maureen.

I felt like the author's attitude towards Maureen was very callous towards the end of the book. She was resistant to Maureen coming to New York, even though she knew Maureen was alone with her parents. Why *wouldn't* you want to rescue your sister from that life, especially the sister you swore to protect on the day she was born? When Maureen came to NYC anyway, Jeannette left Maureen's care entirely to her older sister Lori. When Maureen left for California, Jeannette did not speak to her again for many many years, apparently until their mother announced that Maureen would be coming for a visit just beyond the last pages of the book.

I can absolutely understand why Maureen did not turn out to be as well-adjusted as her siblings. I wish we knew more about what happened to her.

vupw8h,Just finished Shuggie Bain and am literally on the floor,"I budgeted about five days but finished it in two. Not exactly a breezy July 4th week vacation read, but it put a face to the Thatcher era for me and was just a plain gripping drama. 


The opening chapter darkly hung over everything decent happening to younger Shuggie. But even so, I still wanted these times to last longer. 


And it's difficult to trash talk Agnes, as she's really just drinking to escape Glasgow, casual violence of the place, and Shug Sr. The things she puts the kids through hurt nonetheless, even if there are nice moments, like the dancing with Shuggie. I rooted for her to stay sober, even if I knew that there was a reason why he was living alone at sixteen. 


And yeah, I hated Eugene for egging her on to drink again, at a nice restaurant. The neighbors who kept showing up to drink with her were pitiful bc they also were likely trying to escape the same casual violence and toxic relationships as Agnes, and I just wished they also tried to get sober. But Eugene literally knew about Agnes' desire not to drink, and was offering non-alcoholic drinks on their prior dates. Cynicism induced by night shift aside, it's not like he was drinking to escape anything. He didn't have to do that. 


But then again, he was just one of the adults who let down Shuggie and Leek (with Catherine escaping). School teachers that ignored the truancy, bullying, and signs of home life issues were unnamed and also could have done literally anything to help the family out. But they were prob just done with Glasgow and its daily realities.

At the same time it's like he's writing his books specifically for poor white trash underachievers. His protagonists aren't people you'd want to be. They aren't heroes. 


Dave's torture and despair are real. For all his supernatural exploits, for all the other-wordly horror he's experienced, it's really just normal life that hurts him the most. Alcoholism, depression, problems with his weight, a life of dead-end jobs; Dave is really at his best when he and John are fighting to stop the end of the world. Dave lives in a dying, decaying world, and it's grinding him down and shredding him as a human being. But he rises to the occasion when Satan is knocking at the door and trying to lay a shit of parasitic maggots all over humanity's Persian rug. He's eerily relatable. 


John is basically Dave's polar opposite. That shitty dead end life? When the supernatural interrupts that life, Dave wishes it would just go away so he could go back to things as usual. John? John loves this peril in his own weird way. John is a joyous hedonist, who likes to piss on monsters and beat them with a folding chair. John is basically the one special creature in the universe that Darwin made an exemption for. John is good when it counts, terrible when it doesn't, and an engine of chaos and stupidity so dense it flabbergasts the forces of evil.


John can't get enough of the supernatural weirdness. You know what he calls a supernatural abduction that cannot be explained in ways mortals would understand it? He calls that 'A Screaming Clown Dick'. Nuff said.


And the writing? Just in general? Lovecraft can write things that fill you with a cold and existential sort of dread. David Wong can do that, in a way that would make Lovecraft puke with so much force that the contents of his colon wind up splattered on the walls. 


If you haven't read this series, I'd recommend it. If you have any doubts, form a single file line and I'll punch you in the balls and tell you how you are going to die. Nah, just kidding. I won't punch you in the balls.

mp0xf1,They both die at the end -Review-,"*This contains spoilers*

I have so many things to say about this book, that I’m not sure I can summarize it.
 The way the characters are described and how they evolve through the book is really beautiful. I love the contrast between Mateo and Rufus and how they fit together really well even if it wouldn’t seem that way at the start. The character development they both have (but mostly Mateo), still amazes me. I think it’s because they helped each other change, that they get along so well.

 The way this book hurt me is amazing, you know how it’s going to end from the start, but still, when it comes to an end it hits you so hard its unreal. I’m still waiting for the plot twist or somebody to tell me there’s a sequel and that they actually survive. The exact same thing happens with life though, we know it’s ending but we still waste it all in things that don’t matter. This book makes me wonder, what would happen if we lived our lives as if every day was the last one? What would happen if we enjoyed every day to the max, met new people, and traveled because we don’t know if we are even getting a tomorrow? 

I absolutely loved it and how the story is told.  I love how the author connected every single character they introduce, and the different way they see and live that day. How their actions affect others and how that affects them in the end. For example, how Mateo’s kindness helped him, with the gang member who he gave his shoes to so selflessly.

I think its important to mention Delilah, because she’s really different from all the other characters. She lives her last day like any other, thinking the Death Cast call is a joke. In the end, when she realizes it wasn’t a joke her first words are: “I wasted the day- I thought… I’m so stupid, I’m so fucking stupid. I wasted the day” however she lived that day like every other, does that mean she wasted all her life? If she had things she wanted to do, why didn’t she do them when she could? Why don’t we all? Does that mean we’re waiting for someone to tell us we’re going to die to do everything we want to, even though we know we’re going to die since the way we were born?

I also love the irony of Mateo’s death. He was so scared of going outside thinking he would die, and what actually killed him was inside of his own home. I think that applies as a metaphor for many things.
 
Now, my biggest question after finishing this book is: What would happen if Death Cast existed in our World? Would we enjoy our everyday day life because we don’t know if we’re getting the call the next day? Or would the everyday we don’t get the call be lived normally like any other just because we’re confident we’re not dying?
And now, if you know you’re dying would you hide and try to escape it, like Mateo? Or would you live that last day to the max like Rufus knowing that doing that can be the same thing that kills you?


One of my favorite quotes from the whole book is:

“No matter how we choose to live, we both die at the end” -Mateo Torrez

I feel like this quote summarizes the books meaning really well, we are all going to die someday, what matters is how we choose to spend the time before that.

Another quote I love is:

“You didn’t just keep me alive, you made me live”- Mateo Torrez

I just hope I can find something like this in the future. Someone whom I can live everyday like it’s the last with.

Despite everything, a part of me still thinks it was for the best they both passed away. That way, what they had, stayed like that, as perfect memory, despite its ups and downs. I feel like if they had gotten a forever together, that feeling would’ve maybe disappeared with time or maybe they decided they weren’t what they were looking for. That would hurt me more than the actual ending. I think part of the beauty of the book is exactly that, the little time they had together and the amazing things they made of it.

Still, Rufus and Mateo, I hope you meet in the afterlife whether it is in a theater room or somewhere you can do anything you wish. I wish you the happy ending you never got. I hope you meet your respective families and get to say proper goodbye’s and hello’s.

This book makes me want to go out and live.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mp0xf1/they_both_die_at_the_end_review/,2021-04-11T22:25:42Z,7,18,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
103ko3p,Tress of the Emerald Sea By Brandon Sanderson,"Heres a review of ""Tress of the Emerald Sea"" By Brandon Sanderson.

Spoiler free TLDR : Its hands down one of my favorite books of all time. Easily a 10/10 absolutely worth your time once it fully releases in a couple weeks. 

I am new to reviewing books so manage your expectations and here is my spoiler free review: 

Tress of the Emerald Sea was good enough for me to finish same day it released and is one of only 2 books that I have actively wanted to reread right after I finished it. Yes I have enough self control to not actually do that, but I will be reading it multiple times this year and I imagine I will turn to it as an easy comfort book for the odd reading. 

I loved the characters and only wished we got more scenes with Huck. Thats literally my only character related complaint. The 3 villains all had enough 'screen time' and we spend enough time with all the other characters to get to know them, especially Tress. I really felt like each character acted their age and acted how well traveled they said they were. And we don't get bogged down in every detail about every person and place. For instance Fort and Crow don't revel how much they have traveled or why they traveled that much. And we get descriptions of less then half of the magic of their world and less then a quarter about the world itself.

Tress was a good enough character to get her own paragraph. She was a perfect protagonist. Her best traits are simply quick thinking, determination, and charisma. That last one is especially hard to describe much less write so props to Brandon Sanderson for getting that well written. Her quick thinking saved her in several scenes which of course ended up being the best scenes in the book. But she isn't particularly smarter then other people, shes just determined enough to learn what other people are far to scared to lean. Some people might call her a Mary Sue, but I reject that idea out right since every time she does something outstanding she it is always one step away from blowing up in her face, or something she got a lot of help with. Anyone can follow an instruction book, but to have the bravery to use high explosives you can't sweat on is a tall order. Hence she is simply determined enough to get away with doing such incredible feats and is not a Mary Sue. And of course it can't go unsaid that all of that determination comes from her love which is exactly something you would expect from a love sick teen.

Tress is easily one of my favorite characters ever and the book is worth reading just for her.

The plot is pretty standard for a pirate tale involving magic. You have your talking pets, magic curses, riddle, rituals, guns, cannons, random politics of being a pirate, talks of mutiny, weird witch doctor thats also a normal doctor, and of course sailing dangerous seas full of dragons and sorceresses and sea monsters so dangerous no one comes back alive! Seriously you can guess the big plot points you would see in a high school essay and the rest aren't exactly twists on the classic tropes (they are classics for a reason) but they have a new refreshing flavor. 

The magic is unique and fits the story well. Specifically it fits Tress' personality and the fact that it is a pirate book. Without many spoilers it should be no surprise that the magic is involved with how the cannons and guns work. But what is surprising is how the magic impacts the logistics of the pirating itself. By the way, the way how pirating works is described is apparently a good summary of how it actually worked historically. Oh and that weird bit about the weird physics thing the book describes >!fluidization!< Is real and you can google it if you want. Toy boats and all. 

The book is character focused and plot driven meaning that the book describes in detail how every major plot shake impacts Tress and her mission, and about how she needs to stay on course for both her mission and on top of her morals as events occur. Every last villain is treated exactly how you would expect a mildly inconvenienced teenager to treat them. And it works because of the level of detail given to her decisions and characterization. 

Overall this was one of my favorite books of all time. I keep track of the books I've read since quarantine started and have ranked those books against each other. And this was an easy #4 out of a total pf 40 books! An easy 10/10 And I expect that rating to stick as time goes on. Once I get my hard copy in the mail I am going to start a reread. And later in the year I'll reread it via the audio book. And once the paper back comes out I'll get another copy to keep in my car for emergencies. That is how much I have loved this book. 

If you didn't like the book thats fine, everyone can have an opinion after all, but I am curious why not. Just not someones favorite genre, or you don't like the authors style or something else I'm not thinking about?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/103ko3p/tress_of_the_emerald_sea_by_brandon_sanderson/,2023-01-05T00:48:53Z,35,67,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
kaguz0,Gone with the Wind favorite scenes?,"This is my second time reading Mitchell's novel; I love this book. However, it seems as if I am the sole person who has read and enjoys it, for there is no one with whom to fangirl. I really just wish to learn what sections of the book I should mark to reread over and over again.

I excitedly scream nearly every time Rhett appears. Of course there is the classic scene at the bbq when Scarlett throws the vase, but Rhett also proved to be an immoral non-gentleman when Melly brought home the prostitute's money in his handkerchief.

I gleamed with pleasure when Rhett called a bid for Scarlett's dances at the first social function she attended since Charlie's demise, a mere year into mourning. The dialogue and descriptions were captivating and highly risible.

Lastly, another favorite scene was when the inebriated Gerald had to be escorted home by his charmingly villainous future son-in-law, how Scarlett came downstairs in nighttime dishabille, and how Rhett was so infuriatingly/mockingly decent.

7s3oih,Is anyone else here upset about the small amount of superhero novels?,"I'm a reader and a writer. There aren't many young adult or adult novels that pursue characters with superpowers or characters who lead superhero lives, or anything of the sort. I wish there was more. Movies often have many holes and last no more than 3 hours or are often made simply for the box office or merch. I believe the books would offer a larger perspective on the characters' inner happenings and how their powers and high duty affect their ability to lead lives. I think that books could tell more than movies do and allow us to paint scenery into our heads and gave fun with it. Possibly relate to the characters more as well, since we can live as them during the events. I imagine it would be more indulging than some sci-fis.

I'm a writer who has ideas for novels, but I get discouraged. I feel as if people only care about films and comics, or else there would be more novels out there. Even online, there's not much of a demand for original content around superheroes. 

I'd like to hear what you guys think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7s3oih/is_anyone_else_here_upset_about_the_small_amount/,2018-01-22T05:36:27Z,24,0,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
iyyqmt,Just finished 'The Blind Watchmaker' by Richard Dawkins,"It was excellent. I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about science and anyone who wants to truly understand what evolution is. I know too many people who think evolution is just ""monkeys giving birth to humans""... wish they'd read this book.

If science isn't your strong suit then the book is still worth the read. Although I wouldn't say I struggle with science, it isn't my strong suit either. I have taken some university level science courses and found myself struggling at times with 2 of the chapters. The biomorph land chapter was the first, but I understood his example perfectly by the end of the chapter. I think the other was the second last chapter(?). Again, I eventually got the point but it definitely took some thinking (and he warns you of this). Either way the book is worth getting if you're not very science literate, he writes the book with long drawn-out explanations on purpose. These can get tedious after a while though.

15egvqv,My thoughts on The Count of Monte Cristo,"Did I like this book? Absolutely, it is an incredible novel. Did I love it? No.

Maybe I started reading this with very high expectations because every single review that I read heralded this book as the best ever written and I was expecting something extraordinary, but I got something that was just good. There’s nothing wrong with that but I just don’t  feel that highly about this book.

I don’t like abridged editions. And I’m going say that a book like this doesn’t deserve to be abridged. But a good revision would have been a good idea. This book could have been 200 pages shorter and I think it wouldn’t have hurt the story in any way. I’m not saying Dumas should have gotten rid of any of the scenes, it’s just that some dialogue and some descriptions and some events could have been shorter. There is a lot of repetition going on and sometimes it is just annoying and it ads nothing to the story. I really, really liked the first and the last 200 pages of this. The middle 800… well, those could have been better.

Edmond Dantes was a great character. Really liked him and I was constantly rooting for him and wishing that he would get out of jail and get  back the life that he deserved. But then he turned into The Count. I have never disliked a protagonist more than this guy. A literal Mary Sue, this guy has no weaknesses ( and no Mercedes doesn’t count). He knows nearly everything, is a master fighter, very rich, very beautiful, can make stuff happen with just a snap of his fingers, is an agent of Providence, has The AlMiGhTy GoD behind him and is also the most pretentious character I have ever had the displeasure of reading about. This guy nearly single handedly made this book a chore to read. Only near the end when he starts showing some degree of emotion does he become kinda interesting. And also what was that with Haydee! One moment he thought of her as his daughter and then the next he was lusting after her. Guess Mercedes Benz had  had one too many rides for our dear old Count.

Concerning the villains, only Villefort was the one worth reading about. I personally would have loved a book about him and his family life. He had a life, passions, downfall and feelings; in short he is the only 3d villain in the story. Danglars and Fernand, while they have their reasons, considering Dumas didn’t spent as much time with them, appear to be a bit more cartoonish.

Albert for me is the best character in this novel and the only reason why I kept reading. Because, like Villefort, this guy also is more developed and feels more like a real person. I liked his hotheadedness, his strength and humility and his ability to apologise. He and his mother deserved better.

Anyway, these are my general thoughts about this book. Despite the fact that I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I would have liked, I’m quite excited about reading more Dumas, starting with The Three Musketeers.

Thanks for reading and if want to, you can share your thoughts about this book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15egvqv/my_thoughts_on_the_count_of_monte_cristo/,2023-07-31T13:54:25Z,9,9,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
8niypu,"""The Hate U Give"" by Angie Thomas has made me excited to read again","I've recently been trying to get back into reading, so I've been going with YA novels because I've always found them very easy to read. ""The Hate U Give"" was recommended to me by my mother, and I couldn't be happier that I followed her advice. 

This book had me laughing out loud, crying, and so angry that I had to walk away from it for a while. It's the exact kind of book I wish existed when I was in high school as a person from a mixed race family. It is bluntly honest on both sides of the issue of police brutality in the US, and for me, it's exactly what I needed to read at this moment in time.

The characters are vivid and colorful, the narrator has an amazingly clear voice, and the world in which these characters exist is so well painted and familiar that I could practically see the story unfolding as I read. 

I blasted through this book in a day, and I couldn't tell you the last time I read a book over 400 pages in a day. This book has effectively jumpstarted my love for reading again, so thank you, Angie Thomas, for your wonderfully relevant and colorful story.

rtiynp,"""They Both Die At The End""... some thoughts I'd like to share","I finished this book yesterday (or should I say last year lol... I'm terrible at jokes sorry) and I felt like there was a lot to say about it.
I have... mixed feelings for this book, to say the least.
I thought it was a good story, an excellent one. But I still found it to be very flawed. While reading it, there were moments I felt subverted by my expectations, and other moments where I felt unsatisfied. 
It had as much positive aspects as negative ones.

What I liked:
The relationship between Mateo and Rufus was very moving. It was fun to see how such very different persons drew closer in one single day, and some of their interactions were very enjoyable and made me smile. I really got attached to them. And I absolutely hated Peck and anyone else that wanted to harm them when they were literally living and enjoying their very last day on earth.
I liked how we follow them as they say goodbye to their loved ones, wherever they are, expecting their own death. I really hope Mateo's father woke up and saw the message his son left behind. I liked how the story was shared through testimonies and we get to learn about other characters' personal lives. I liked how some of them even tied together, it was great. And how we got to see how characters that were predicted to die today planned to live this very last day (poor Delilah, she wasted herself and Vin... psycho).
I related most to Mateo because we shared a lot of common points. So... with the ending I... really shed a tear. The ending was very sad, even though the title was warning us from the very beginning. There's also a theory going, saying that at the very last page Rufus got in fact rushed over by Victor's car, who was in a hurry to meet Delilah. I also liked how there was no epilogue, or whatsoever... They both died. That's it. And when you die (brutally), there aren't any elaborate thoughts coming to mind, because you just cease to exist. Sad, but very clever detail in my opinion.

What I disliked:
The writing style was... enjoyable, acceptable but felt so childish and poor at times. It felt like something you'd read on Wattpad. I was kinda disappointed that the author didn't work further on his style, especially with a story based on themes like death and loss. Because of the way it was told, I couldn't exactly feel the emotion I thought I would.
I didn't like either the media-focused, social networks aspects. It kinda ruined the read for me. I know the protagonists wanted to leave something behind after their departure, but the over-use of Instagram and stuff... I felt it was unnecessary. 
I didn't really connect with the friends of Rufus, because they were underdeveloped (maybe?) and there wasn't enough attention put onto them throughout the story. Like, I didn't care at all about Aimee (she was very annoying and at some point I was really wondering about her role in the story). Malcolm and Tagoe were just... cool and fine? Even Lydia's character didn't make me feel a strong connection. The story really was entirely focused on Mateo and Rufus, and that's too bad. World building was kinda weak, though. The concept of Death-Cast was good, but sadly not developed enough, even with the chapter consecrated to Victor who works at D-C.
Some parts even got me cringing... like A LOT. I skipped paragraphs when it was just too cringe to even read.
Lastly, I would have wished... Mateo and Rufus' relationship didn't become romantic. Don't misunderstand me, I have nothing against the LGBT community. Love can't be defined, of course. But I felt like their romance was... forced? Plus, falling in love for one another in one single day feels rather unrealistic. I would have preferred it remained a strong friendship, which is more believable.

Overall, it was an emotional read. A book worth trying out, with a good story and likeable characters. It's flawed, but still good.

11mmmgm,The Queen's Gambit - Netflix or Walter Tevis Novel?,"“It is foolish to run the risk of going mad for vanity's sake.”
- Harry Beltik

I remember the first time I watched The Queen’s Gambit.

It was 2 AM and I needed something mindless to put me to bed. I’d heard about the Netflix show and my jerk reaction to the hype was disgust. I expected to find something similar to ‘Too Hot To Handle.’

I was so wrong.

I binged through all 7 episodes. All in one fully focused sitting. I couldn’t believe the captivating structure of the narrative. Every episode built on the previous one’s hypnosis.

“She had made a discovery with the three cans of beer...With the pills there was a long wait before the swooning came into her stomach and loosened the tightness. The beer gave her the same feeling with almost no wait.”
-Elizabeth Harmon

At the end of the final episode the credits show that The Queen’s Gambit is an adaptation of a novel written by Walter Tevis, a writer I had never heard of.

So I looked him up.

Walter Tevis wrote 'The Hustler' which was adapted into a successful Paul Newman film. He wrote 'The Color of Money’ which was adapted by Martin Scorsese, starring Tom Cruise. He wrote The Queen’s Gambit. Published in 1983, a year before his death. And he graduated from The Iowa Writers’ Workshop. My dream school.

I got a Kindle copy because buying paperbacks of lesser known authors in Dubai is expensive. At the end of my first reading I knew it wouldn’t be my last.

“How old were you when you started playing?”
“Five. I was District Champion at seven. I hope to be a World Champion one day.”
“When?”
“In three years.”
“You'll be sixteen in three years. If you win, what will you do afterward?”
He looked confused.
“I don't understand.”
“If you're a World Champion at sixteen, what will you do with the rest of your life?”
He still looked confused.
“I don't understand.”
- Elizabeth Harmon & Georgi Girev

I watched The Queen’s Gambit for the second time with my mother. Hindi dubbed. Not only were the translations hilarious. But, when Beth goes through her booze & pills bender, smoking and dancing around in nothing but her underwear, my mother, astonished, said in Hindi,

“What is this dirty girl doing!?”

But when the credits rolled, my mum had that private smile we all know when we’ve experienced something memorable.

“My experience has taught me that what you know isn’t always important.”
“What is important?”
“Living and growing. Living your life.”
- Alma Wheatley & Elizabeth Harmon

I’ve just finished reading The Queen’s Gambit for the second time in paperback. And I can’t help but feel raw.

I love this story.

It’s something I’ve always needed when I’ve had to get back up.

From anxiety.
From fear.
From vice & self loathing.

The simple way to describe The Queen’s Gambit is to say it’s a story about chess. Or a story about feminism. Or as Scott Frank (director & writer of The Netflix show and interestingly the screenplay writer of the Oscar nominated superhero film ‘Logan’) describes it - a story about the cost of genius.

But to me it means so much more.

It’s a story about comebacks. Of heartbreak and triumph. Of a prodigy who is unbelievably relatable. Because the traumatic price of her talents is not one I’d wish on my worst foe.

It’s a story about gender. Of how important it is to see someone just like you accomplishing the incredible.

It’s a story about camaraderie. Of sportsmanship. Of mutual respect between people who don’t merely differ within a country’s political spectrum, but literally come from separate sides of the monolithic Iron Curtain.

It’s a story about passion. Of the romance found within 64 squares. Of the hard work required mentally, physically, and spiritually to be the best. And as derivative as that sounds of any other Hero’s Journey, The Queen’s Gambit has some uniquely charismatic trademarks.

The Language: Simple as Hemingway’s. But with a depth that rivals ancient haiku.
The Narrative: Opening. Midgame. Endgame. Engineered like a rare watch.
The Characters: Alma Wheatley is the friend-mother we all wish for. Benny Watts flips the femme fatale archetype to homme fatale and gives a romantic challenge as intriguing as chess.

And Borgov.

“There’s one player that scares me. The Russian.”
- Elizabeth Harmon

Vasily Borgov. Even the name makes the air around it tremble.

World Champion.
Grandmaster.
Ascetic as a razor.

And eyes that bore into you like a sniper.

Never before has an antagonist been built up with so much quiet terror.

There are other characters (Jolene, Shaibel) that I want to avoid describing to leave something new for first time readers and viewers.

Which brings me to the question:

Should you watch The Queen’s Gambit?
Or
should you read the novel?

My honest opinion is this:

I envy those that have yet to discover the novel for the first time completely unfamiliar.

And,
I’m very glad for the unique poignance of the Netflix show.

Irrespective of my biases,
I don’t think you could go wrong.

Both mediums are brilliant.

Frankly,
books are just the delivery system.
The story is what matters.

And The Queen’s Gambit is a story that definitely delivers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11mmmgm/the_queens_gambit_netflix_or_walter_tevis_novel/,2023-03-09T08:07:04Z,11,36,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
b09tg9,Just finished The Millenium Series by Stieg Larson (and completed by David Lagercrantz),"Lisbeth Salander is a badass and without her character I wouldn’t have even made it past the first book.

I’m glad I finished them all, but overall the series was sort of “meh”. IMO, the first one was the greatest and then it went downhill consistently.

The fifth book (The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye) was easily my least favorite. The plot/mystery was significantly less complex than the other four and the writing was very sloppy- redundant sentence structures and dialogue. The way Lagercrantz jumped back and forth between present and past was also just too muddled for me. Seemed like the ending came quickly and he just wanted to wrap it up.

I almost wish Lagercrantz hadn’t continued this series because, from what I understand, it was against Larsson’s wife’s wishes and she is apparently under possession of a remaining 10 unfinished books in the series. And he really didn’t do it justice.

I had a friend who loved this series and said I would love it even more than the Harry Potter series (last February I read the series for the first time and this February I took on The Millenium Series). I had another friend who shrugged and said I would probably find it mediocre, it was an “easy read” for her. Hilarious because I honestly didn’t consider this an “easy read” at all. It feels like there were so many characters. On top of that, some of the characters in each of the books were way too similar to me and I had trouble differentiating them.

Anybody reading it?","I loved the premise, liked the characters, liked some of the moral dilemmas depicted and although it's not a masterpiece of the genre by any means  it's still enjoyable and thought-provoking.  Here's  a plot description:


Historian Jon Keller is on a trip to Switzerland when the world ends. As the lights go out on civilisation, he wishes he had a way of knowing whether his wife, Nadia, and their two daughters are still alive. More than anything, Jon wishes he hadn't ignored Nadia's last message.

Twenty people remain in Jon's hotel. Far from the nearest city and walled in by towering trees, they wait, they survive.

Then one day, the body of a young girl is found. It's clear she has been murdered. Which means that someone in the hotel is a killer.

As paranoia descends, Jon decides to investigate. But how far is he willing to go in pursuit of justice? And what kind of justice can he hope for, when society as he knows it no longer exists.

y1cuh1,"The hidden transphobia in ""The Art of Being Normal""","*The Art of Being Normal* claims to be a book about the experience of transgender children, and the author worked in the Gender Identity Development Service with many people struggling with their gender identity. From the way that the novel is written, it seems like she has a baseline knowledge of transgender experiences, but it is clear that her knowledge is all second hand.

The book overall tells a good story, even from a representational perspective, but it contains many flawed ideas surrounding trans people and these can be harmful to those who don't already know that they are harmful. The two main characters are a trans guy called Leo and a trans girl called Kate, but both of these characters misgender one another and reference one another using transphobic language at several points. Kate comes out to Leo in the middle of the book, but he continues to deadname her and use he/him pronouns for her up until the very last chapter, even though at one point he says that ""I even start to feel a bit guilty about continuing to think of him as ""he"" at all."". Since Leo begins his transition before the start of the book, Kate always refers to him properly but it is clear that the character has a lot of internalized transphobia that doesn't serve the plot and was most likely a projection of the author's own hidden transphobia. That being said, her immediate reaction to him coming out is to say ""You're a girl?"" to which his reaction explains that ""I actually prefer the term ""natal female"""".

The entire book, whether intentionally or not, implies that trans people want to be their gender rather than already being it. Quite a common theme throughout the book is the idea that Leo isn't who people think he is because he is trans, and the fact that he's trans is used as a plot twist. Here's an extract of his first coming out scene, where he is hesitant to get to fourth base with his girlfriend, Alicia.

>""Alicia squeezes my hand as if to say go on, and I know I can't put it off any longer. Suddenly I feel dizzy, like if I opened my eyes Alicia's room would be spinning at a hundred miles per hour. I take a deep breath.  
>  
>""OK, the reason I've been acting so weird is because I'm not who you think I am.""  
>  
>I feel Alicia's grip on my hand slacken ever so slightly.  
>  
>I need to say it now, quickly, like ripping off a plaster, before I can change my mind.  
>  
>""I wasn't born Leo,"" I say, my voice growing quieter and quieter, so I'm almost whispering.  
>  
>Ella Fitzgerald has stopped singing. The room is silent.  
>  
>""I was born a girl.""  
>  
>I keep my eyes closed as Alicia's hand shoots from mine.""

The idea that trans people aren't who they say they are is incredibly transphobic, and this scene in particular places too much emphasis on *I used to be a girl* when most trans people wouldn't reference themselves like that. I, as a trans girl, would never say that I was *born a boy* as a way of coming out, because it implies that I wasn't always a girl, and if I don't actively come out as trans that doesn't mean that I'm pretending to be someone else. He was pretending to be a girl before he came out, just as Kate was pretending to be a boy. The whole book phrases moments where she is talking about being trans as though she is a boy who wants to be a girl, and not already a girl living in a masculine body.

Kate's private moments before she comes out would have been good if it wasn't painfully obvious that the book was written by a cis person. It contains the (almost) cliché of it being difficult to look in the mirror, which is a real problem for some trans people with major dysphoria but it feels shoehorned in. She does a weekly inspection of herself - things like hair length, foot size, penis size and similar masculinizing features - and writes it all down in a notebook that she... brings to school for some reason???? A lot of trans people will do these kinds of inspections, as it can be like an addiction, but it's not realistic for them to write it down and *bring the book into school.* It's clear that this element was only written in to be a part of her (well written but poorly worded) hate crime where she meets Leo. She also has a dress-up box (this is how it's referenced and presented in the book), which a lot of particularly transfeminine people may have but the way it's written, again, presents her as if she is pretending and wishing to be a girl but isn't actually.

There are many more points that I'm not going to get into right now, but I would love to talk with others who have read this book about it. As a trans girl with some shared experience with Kate, I loved the story but the representation of trans people was awful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y1cuh1/the_hidden_transphobia_in_the_art_of_being_normal/,2022-10-11T16:03:50Z,75,0,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
kq1fef,Trying to finish The Duke and I by Julie Quinn and boy do I have some thoughts,"For the last week on 2020, I wanted to read something small and quick, and with Bridgerton streaming on Netflix, I thought it would be a good idea if I read the book as I watch it. 71% through the novel (as my lovely Kindle informs me) and I am having such a hard time finishing it up. 

Firstly, the characters to me were quite unlikeable. Daphne reads like a wannabe, Wish-ordered, rip-off version of Elizabeth Bennet, who I love with all my heart. She is the kind of a character who's claim to fame is the fact that she is ""one of the boys"". More than halfway through, I still don't know anything about her-- of her relationships with her sisters, or even her mother, to an extent. In fact, it is simply her relationship with the ABC brothers that has been showcased to some extent, and even that doesn't lend her any substance, in my opinion. And that saviour complex thing that she has going for Simon-- while I do realize this is an old book, the ""hes broken and I can save him"" thing is a tired trope that I don't just don't have the patience for any more. And let's not get started on her character: which That Scene is already a testament to. She is manipulative and disrespectful and that's all I have to say here. 

(I must confess I cheated a little and learned about That Scene and I'm outraged. Because I can see the way the story is unravelling now to see how it leads to that, and why? why would you do that? So not only is she bland but also quite bad because she doesn't respect boundaries, or other people's wishes because they do not suit her, so she can go to hell anyway.) 

Moving on to Simon-- while I did like his character history, and how that shapes him as an adult, I found his adult self quite superficial. There wasn't a lot to his attraction to Daphne, and overall, it seemed to lack substance. Not to mention his own toxic behaviours as well, and especially the lying through omission. I would have liked seeing more of him and Anthony together but that's neither here or there. He was quite an unremarkable character for me here. 

What I did like was the two characters' chemistry. Again, there wasn't a lot to it but they seemed to work well together, at least until about halfway through. I also liked that Simon had a stutter-- I'm all for the representation and I like how that factors in heavily into how Simon turns out to be. Lastly, I like the narrating style of the novel, and how it weaves society talk with the actual events. Is it enough to keep me going? I'm afraid not. Will I complete the book? I think I will. 

But I will write a Reddit post justifying why I am taking so long getting around finishing it. 💪",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kq1fef/trying_to_finish_the_duke_and_i_by_julie_quinn/,2021-01-04T04:42:58Z,4,8,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
qckrau,I didn’t like the November 9 plot twist,"Okay so I’ve only recently got into reading, like just a couple months ago, but I’ve read 7 books so far (which I think is a good amount, like 3-4 books a month lmao). I read the entire Off Campus series (all 5 books), Ugly Love and November 9. In this order.

Before I started reading November 9, the Deal was my favorite book. And I LOVED it, it’s the one that got me into reading again, so it’s basically what I compare everything to. And as I was reading November 9 I thought “Damn, I guess I found my new favorite book, this is even better than The Deal”, and I felt this way until Fallon picked up Ben’s book and started reading it. Up until that moment I had absolutely adored every aspect of the story, the pacing was amazing, there were no boring parts, the chemistry between Ben and Fallon was incredible and I just loved how they were making each other become better versions of themselves during their “coming of age” years. And I guess it really drew me in because I’m 18, the same age as the characters when the story begins.


But after the 5th encounter, I feel like it went downhill real fast. I hate that Ben was the one who started the fire and felt guilty about it because I just can’t see him as truly genuine anymore. Not because he didn’t tell Fallon, but because their whole story was that two complete strangers met and developed an undeniable connection after only one day and decided it was too good to let go, but at the same time allowing each other to grow. And they fell in love after only seeing each other once a year. And they had their ups and downs, but imo it was the perfect story. I honestly felt like their falling out after the 3rd and 4th encounter was enough drama. I wouldn’t mind one last obstacle, but definitely not what we got.


And I’m not saying that Ben’s feelings weren’t genuine, I think they were, but imo the fact that he felt guilty of her burns changes everything. Because one of the things that made Fallon fall in love with Ben is that he made her regain her confidence and I just can’t be convinced that he didn’t hype up her scars out of guilt. This is a really bad analogy, but basically I see it as if someone gave u a really bad haircut and then called it beautiful because what else are you going to do, you are responsible for it after all. And I wish that Ben had simply loved her appearance for what it was, not because he felt responsible for what led to her low self esteem. 


And I also didn’t actually enjoy reading it after that. Before, I just couldn’t put it down, but after it was no longer fun. Firstly because all problems would have been solved if Fallon had JUST LISTENED to what Ben had to say. No one would ever not finish reading that book. Who would just get up and leave without actually knowing the truth about what happened? It makes absolutely no sense. And what makes even less sense is why did Ben wait an entire year to deliver the book and the letter to her door??? There was absolutely no need to wait that long. It honestly just made both parties miserable for 300 days more than it needed to (I gave the 65 days remaining for Ben to finish writing it hahhahah). And although I do like how it ended, like that final scene, I wish we had gotten an epilogue where they got married, Ben became a famous writer and Fallon opened her own acting school and it became the most successful one in LA.



So yeah, basically I feel like the plot twist ruined the book for me. I will still recommend it to my less opinionated friends, cuz I know they will love it lol.
Definitely didn’t one up on The Deal (remains my number one). 


I think I would put November 9 in 3rd place in my rankings, so 1st The Deal, 2nd The Score and 3rd November 9",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qckrau/i_didnt_like_the_november_9_plot_twist/,2021-10-21T05:45:07Z,22,9,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
ft8u9o,The Scythe Series,"Has anyone read the Scythe series? If so, please comment on any theories you have down below. I love reading new theories about this series because Neal Shusterman ended his series on such an uncomfortable note. Any opinions about the book you would like to discuss? Comment below! I would love to hear anything anyone has to say about the series. Here are a couple of my thoughts.

Neal Shusterman loves to write the books super slow and then the last 100 pages are packed with information. This did not bother me at first, but whilst reading Thunderhead is started to annoy me. Neal is a very talented author and I just love the series, but this style of writing is so annoying for a reader to read. The Toll was better about pacing, but I just wish the pacing was even.

I would absolutely love for Neal Shusterman to finish off what happens once Citra woke up. The ending was beautiful, but it left me wondering.

90r2gy,Has anyone read Jay Rubin's The Sun Gods?,"I just finished reading it today and damn was it a hard book to read. I am neither Japanese nor American but I was really not ""in the know"" about how the Japanese were treated during WWII.

Without spoiling anything, I thought the ending was really rushed and anticlimactic so ultimately I was left with a bad taste in my mouth which was a shame - the last chapter could have easily been expanded into 3... nevertheless I was really immersed in the book and in Billy's quest to find out about his connection to Japan, and hearing of the things the Japanese Americans, who had nothing to do with the Japanese government during WWII, went through because of racism and fearmongering. 

I know that with time I would forgive the rushed last chapter because the rest of the book is a really well written historical fiction (as in, the people and the plot weren't real but the events sorrounding them were). Some of the characters could have been slightly more rounded and I wish I got to know more about what drove some of the choices they made throughout the book, but I guess that wishing a book was longer is a good thing, no?

Anyway, back to the title - has anyone read it? Anyone with American/Japanese/American and Japanese background? How did you feel about it?

2jrloj,The Night Circus,"So I just finished ""The Night Circus"" in a day. As soon as I had turned the last page, I went back and read it again. I did not want to finish this book. I am a fanatic reader, I devour books of all sorts - and I can't remember when I last felt that strongly about a story. I realize that it has its flaws, however, for me, the experience was magical. Erin Morgenstern created something that I longed for as a child, something that you feel you always wanted but could never have, like a distant dream in which your wishes come true, but you wake up and realize that you have to go back to the same life you led before you went to bed. 
That is what putting this book down felt like to me. Her writing is beautiful and even though the characters do seem a bit flat, I fell in love with them almost immediately and stayed in love until the end. The descriptions of the circus are mesmerizing, I could smell the candy apples, the popcorn, I could hear the patrons whispering full of excitement for the next show. Yes, there might be more sophisticated literature, but this book truly made me dream.  
Any thoughts?

Edit: Thank you for all of your comments on this! I have to say, after giving it some thought, I think it's really the circus that drew me in, not so much the characters or the plot at all. I agree with all of you that say that the development of both fell short, however, for me personally, I think that might have been exactly what pulled my concentration towards the prose and the circus itself, so I really did not mind. 
And, once again, this shows that only half of the book is written by the author, the other half is what the reader makes of it in their minds ;-)

14z0yxs,"Hey Hun: Sales, Sisterhood, Supremacy, and the other Lies Behind Multilevel Marketing -My Thoughts","If you have never read *Hey, Hun* by Emily Paulson, [this article here](https://nypost.com/2023/06/21/book-hey-hun-exposes-the-ugly-side-of-multilevel-marketing/) is a good summary (even if you don't read the book, I recommend the article just on its own). The book is part memoir about Paulson's time in an MLM & part research about MLMs & why they are so powerful & manipulative. I listened to the audiobook off of Libby (side note: Libby is the best) which felt like listening to a really intriguing podcast, so if that's a format you enjoy, I strongly recommend checking it out on there.

If you've consumed MLM-related content before like the [LulaRich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJgkwIHp1pc&t=32s) documentary (or if you don't have Prime, its [Vice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6eujSJ0-RU) equivalent) you're probably pretty familiar with the narrative beats of many former MLM rep stories: company suckers in women (often lonely, stay-at-home moms) in want of purpose & a little money, pushes a lot of toxic positivity convincing them to invest increasingly more time & money into their ""business"", shady founders/higher-ups spout backwards ideologies, the MLM gets in the way of said person's friends, family, financial/mental wellbeing, and eventually everything comes crashing down around them. Similar elements in many tales, just swap out the companies & their products: leggings, essential oils, makeup, etc.

From a narrative perspective, Paulson's book was interesting because she was one of the few .001% who ended up being successful in her company (Rodan + Fields fyi), but it still takes its toll her in pretty profound ways such. One example: MLM's destructive partying culture. All the conferences, parties, and company-hosted vacations created an atmosphere for drinking that leads Paulson on a downward spiral to the point where she is arrested for a DUI *the same night* she is awarded a company car. When she stops drinking, her company (the same one holding all these boozy events) touts her around the country to give convention talks as if her sobriety journey was an ad for their business (ditto for her cancer diagnosis). After many years shilling over-priced products and building up her downline, Paulson becomes one of the most successful women in her company, but becomes increasingly aware of the cracks in its sisterhood facade.

&#x200B;

The book was published in May of this year (2023), so the events in it are very current. Paulson talks about the impact the COVID 19 pandemic had on more moms joining MLMs with the promise they could easily work from home. She discusses how the rise of social media like TikTok influencer-ified (my word, not hers) MLMs by pressuring reps to be increasingly online and hyper-conscious of their personal brand/image. She even talks about how toxic online spaces became during the 2020 election & January 6th insurrection and the ways in which MLMs benefit from corrupt political dealings. I liked how the book talks about MLMs adopting the language of inclusion & feminist movements while simultaneously upholding white, patriarchal, capitalist ideals. This part may be hit or miss for you. Being a white woman, Paulson makes it clear that she can't speak to the experiences of women of color in MLM spheres. I've read reviews wishing she'd elaborate more on this aspect, and I've read reviews saying it's not her place to do so.

&#x200B;

Another part that may rub folks the wrong way is reading about Paulson's eventual departure from the company, or rather how long it takes for this to happen. Paulson states that in the last year of her time with R+F she did almost no work but because her downline was so huge, she continued to rake in tens of thousands of dollars a month. This was all while she was aware that many of the women below her were losing money and putting themselves in debt hoping their long hours would eventually pay off (they don't; MLMs are build on that fact). On one hand, it is really easy to criticize Paulson for continuing to work with R+F as long as she did, (and from a reader's perspective, the sections at the end where she's hiring an au pair for her kids and going on book tours for her other memoir feel too out-of-touch to find her relatable as our protagonist). That being said, I personally respect Paulson's honesty. In my opinion, she doesn't sugarcoat her actions or try to hide how harmful her involvement was in the company (and if we are being honest with ourselves, I think many of us would have a really hard time walking away from that kind of money). I've been in online spaces (and certain reddit forums) where such ""hunbots"" are treated as the butt of every joke, but I much prefer Paulson's approach at both humanizing these women while being clear on how their actions harm others.

&#x200B;

Some questions I have for you:

* If you read this book, what were your thoughts on it?
* Are there any other good books you also liked about MLMs, scams, or shady businesses?
* Are there any memoirs you've read with a kinda-complicated author?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14z0yxs/hey_hun_sales_sisterhood_supremacy_and_the_other/,2023-07-14T00:12:32Z,37,102,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
y6olvz,Just Finished My Goal for the Year Yesterday,"This won't impress many people here and I expect to be met with ""those are rookie numbers"" but at the beginning of 2022 I set a soft target for myself of reading 24 books this year, to average 2 a month. I've only really started reading for pleasure in the last couple years, and I normally have a hard time committing to anything. So, while it may seem silly or juvenile for a 25 year old man to celebrate something like this, I still wanted to share this ""achievement"" with someone. So, 24 books started and finished since January 1st. 

Favorites:

**Pride and Prejudice** by Jane Austen - Far and away my favorite book that I've read this year. This book made such an impression on me that I went on to read each of her six finished works (loved Emma and Mansfield Park). Jane Austen has such a hilarious way of writing characters, and particularly her sarcastic way of making fun of her most despicable characters (Mr. Collins, Mrs. Norris, John Thorpe, etc. She may be my new favorite author, truly brilliant. 

**Dracula** by Bram Stoker - This book got off to a slow start for me, but once Van Helsing showed up and all the typical vampire tropes along with him (garlic, stake through the heart, etc.) it was a wild ride that I didn't want to put down. The moment that sent me into overdrive was reading the newspaper article about the ""bloofer lady"". From then on, the book had my full attention. A fun read.

**Star Wars: Kenobi** by John Jackson Miller - So I've been a fan of Star Wars since I was a little kid. I never read the EU books growing up because, well, I just didn't like to read for pleasure. Several of the 24 books I read this year were Star Wars books, but this one was definitely my favorite. Not to start any arguments, but I was underwhelmed by the Kenobi show on Disney Plus, and I read this book to see if the old canon story was any better. I found it to be a refreshing story that represented the character of Obi-wan perfectly. The book wasn't itself perfect, but it was just what the doctor ordered, especially at the time that I read it. 

**The Time Machine** by H.G. Wells - Short, sweet, and to the point. I loved this book and found myself enthralled from start to finish. I was thoroughly creeped out just about every time the Time Traveler encountered the Morlocks, and found myself desperately wishing for Weena to survive. I don't have a whole lot to say about this one but it was thrilling pretty much the whole way through and I found the ending in particular to be both tragic and sweet.

With all of that said, I am curious to know a few things:

1. Do you make a point of reading a certain number of books each year?
2. What is one or more of your favorite books that you've read this year?
3. Have you read any of the books I listed above? How do you feel about them?

As I said, I know this isn't particularly impressive, but I am proud of myself for having completed a goal that I set for myself almost a year ago. I do feel generally that I am better off for having read the books I did. I'm gonna take a little break for now, maybe a month, as I have many other hobbies that haven't gotten enough attention as a result of my trying to finish this ""challenge"" (I've got one more season of Twilight Zone to finish up). I will definitely be reading more in 2023, though I may not keep track of it. In some ways it makes it feel more like a job than something done for fun.

at3alq,Just finished the Valdemar series by Mercedes Lackey...,"I read these books before, (except Brightly Burning and the stories about Mags and I really wish I read them earlier, they're amazing!), and quite a few of the trilogies I've read up to three or four times. I didn't think the world of Valdemar would become even more amazing until I read it all chronologically.

I used this site for chronological reference:
https://www.goodreads.com/series/50054-valdemar-chronological

The only difference I made was reading the Mage Wars last. This trilogy was actually the one that got me hooked on Mercedes Lackey, but I found after reading Mage Winds and Mage Storms, I had a much better understanding of the plot. 


What's your favourite Valdemar character/book?

I love Mags he's such a hardcore badass, I can't wait for Eye Spy to come out this July. The story of Lavan Firestorm is absolutely wonderful and heart breaking. I was surprised to find Karal from the Mage Storms to be a new favourite of mine. I've heard a lot of people saying that they found Elspeth annoying, and I'd have to disagree, I found Gwena, her Companion, the annoying one, making Elspeth do annoying things. Yes, a Companion I do not like.  I can't ever forget Talia, my heart ached for her so many times, and I loved her Empathy gift.

People, I could go on forever about these, and I have no one to talk to about it! Please talk to me about these books! I have the biggest book hangover right now, I've been reading this series non-stop since November and now I don't even know what to do with myself. I'm probably going to reread the Obsidian Trilogy to help get myself over it, but I'm a little lost!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/at3alq/just_finished_the_valdemar_series_by_mercedes/,2019-02-21T13:43:35Z,20,17,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
h107ah,"I saw a similar thread but it wouldn’t let me comment, however, I really needed to share my thoughts on The Book Thief.","This was the first book I had added to my “summer reading list.” I finished this book in three days, I could not put it down, and it really was one of my best reads to date. Being a Nazi Germany, WWII related book I was really skeptical because of how many I’ve read already, and i was scared it was going to be so so similar to the others, however it wasn’t at all. This book has permanently left a mark on my soul and my entire attitude towards books and I thought I had a really good attitude towards them already. Not only books, but words, their meanings, and of course Germany during this time. Although it’s a fiction book, this story moved me more than any “based on a true story” book I’ve ever read. Although the ending was extremely abrupt and it seemed i read the last 50 pages faster than the first 500 or so, i think I can really appreciate it, especially since it made me cry like a baby. I’ve only cried like that twice during my time as a serious reader and those books happened to include dogs; Because of Winn-Dixie and Marley & Me. Corny, I know. Liesel Meminger will forever be remembered in my heart, to me, although she’s a 14 year old fictional girl, she’s my hero, and because of her i have a new respect for books and treating others, and i wish i could be more like her. The ending touched me in such a severe way, i cried for nearly 5 minutes after finishing the book (i counted), and remained sniffling for the remaining few hours that night before I went to bed. This book has easily made it onto my top 3 list of books and although it’s a 500+ page book, i highly recommend reading it if you haven’t already. I truly cannot stress it enough how much I appreciate this book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/h107ah/i_saw_a_similar_thread_but_it_wouldnt_let_me/,2020-06-11T14:20:43Z,17,45,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
8arys8,Michael Shaara and “The Killer Angels”,"I had been recommended this book last year, and got it for Christmas, but only just read it a few days ago, and I wish I had done so earlier. 

Shaara wrote a story that seems at one time grounded and transcendent. He doesn’t take too much artistic licensing in his depiction of the American Civil War, and the interactions between the men in his story seem organic and very human. The way he frames each moment is apt and compelling, and I was enthralled from start to end. He sheds light on the nature of man, both from the Union and the Confederacy, and he makes no bias manifest in his writing. He breathes life into men long gone in a way that simply feels right from the minutiae of their day to day life to the grandiose (or surprisingly not) motivations they had to fight. 


 “Chamberlain closed his eyes and saw it again. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. No book or music would have that beauty. He did not understand it: a mile of men flowing slowly, steadily, inevitably up the long green ground, dying all the while, coming to kill you, and the shell bursts appearing above them like instant white flowers, and the flags all tipping and fluttering, and dimly you could hear the music and the drums, and then you could hear the officers screaming, and yet even above your own fear came the sensation of unspeakable beauty. He shook his head, opened his eyes. Professor's mind. But he thought of Aristotle: pity and terror. So this is tragedy. Yes. He nodded. In the presence of real tragedy you feel neither pain nor joy nor hatred, only a sense of enormous space and time suspended, the great doors open to black eternity, the rising across the terrible field of that last enormous, unanswerable question.” 
 
The quote is from my tied-for-favorite character, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (the other being Longstreet). 

I have never read something from American history (much to my chagrin as an American who studies history) that resonated within me quite so much as this does. I will be recommending it to my friends and family because I can say with confidence it’s one of the best pieces of literature I have ever had the pleasure to read. It is triumphant and despondent and everything in between. I plan to revisit Gettysburg this summer in light of this reading because it has truly and wholly spoken to me in a way few pieces of literature really have.

d1xzyf,"My review of ""The Satanic Bible"" by Anton Szandor LaVey","First, let me open up my review with the fact that I have spent a great deal of my life learning and studying many religions.

I have studied and participated in Mormonism (my original faith), Catholicism, Pentacostal and Evangelical Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Skihism, and Buddhism. I have read not only the Mormon scripture, but many accompanied books, their commentaries, including non-Mormon Bible commentaries (Adam Clark's and Matthew Henry's). I have read the *[Holy Qur'an](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/683372.The_Message_of_the_Qur_an)* cover-to-cover three times, and have a gorgeous copy on my bookshelf. I have participated in fasting during the Islamic month of Ramadan, attended a local mosque, and participated in their ceremonies, including the opening feast of Eid al-Fitr. I have a copy of the *Bhagavad Gita*. Although I have not read it, I have attended Hindu ceremonies and rituals. I have also prayed and ate in a Sikh temple.

Every year my wife and I celebrate a different culture or religion for our wedding anniversaries. As of August 2019, we have been married 20 years. Some of the cultures or religions have have celebrated are Irish, Italian, Chinese, Mexican, Japanese, Jewish, Canadian, French, Mormon, Muslim, Hindu, British, Tibet, Native American, Russian, multi-African, and German. These anniversaries include purchasing ""souvenirs"", making traditional food, attending monuments, sites, or festivals. We'll watch documentaries, and even attempt incorporating some of the culture's practice into the day, whatever it may be.

I state this not to brag, but rather that when I learn a new culture or religion, I jump in head-first. So, when I began researching Satanism, it started by reading *The Satanic Bible* by LaVey. I read this, because I want to be educated about Satanism, not because I'm interested in becoming a Satanist, or deconverting anyone away from their faith. As with almost everything religious I read, it's purely an intellectual pursuit, not a devotional one.

Going into it, I was warned about the hypocrisy of Anton LaVey, plagiarism, and even flat out lying and deception by LaVey. Without going into a biography, as this is a book review, suffice it to say that LaVey is not at all what he wanted to portray to his followers, there are portions of *The Satanic Bible* that are plagiarized, and it is not surprising to learn that LaVey did not always practice what he preached, despite devoting many pages to calling out hypocrisy to Christianity.

From a philosophical perspective, [The Church of Satan](https://www.churchofsatan.com/) that LaVey started and *The Satanic Bible* are ego-focused. The most important god is man himself. The Satanic Golden Rule isn't ""do unto others as they would to you"", but rather ""do under others as they do to you"". One of the 9 Satanic Statements by LaVey is actually ""Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek!"". If someone smites you on the cheek, <b>smash his cheek in return!</b>

Further, a lot of the philosophies outlined in this book question the foundational tenets of Christianity, such as the 7 deadly sins. For example, lust isn't a sin, but something that should be encouraged. In fact, Satan only exists in Christianity for preachers and ministers to use as a guilt motivator. Don't masturbate, or you'll go to Hell! Whereas LaVey argues sex should be actively pursued within the moral and legal ethics of society. If one can't find a partner, and feels sexual urges, they should masturbate fully and freely. Lust isn't a sin.

Much of *The Satanic Bible* is in this vein- you are here to seek pleasure, as this is the only life you have, so live it up fully and freely. It's not anarchist, and it's mindful of causing harm to others, so ethics do exist in its teaching. But it's also very carnal. In fact, a major focus of the book is carnal pleasure- sex, nudity, lust, and pleasure.

This doesn't come without its problems though. Women in this book are treated as objects of man's desires. While in rituals, men are to wear black hooded cloaks, women are to dress as provocatively as possible, if dressed at all, to arouse men's sexual desires, to further enhance the emotions of the ritual. Altars should be naked females, and never male. This screams of extreme male chauvinism, sexism, and degradation.  

The worst however, is the insistence in magic and the mystical or supernatural. Most LaVeyan Satanists are atheist, even though most of The Church of Satan is steeped deeply in supernatural magic, such as spells, curses, hexes, demonic invocations, and so forth. As a rational secular thinker, I can't help but think that this is contradictory. On the one hand, you don't believe in Satan as a literal 3rd party person, yet in the same breath, you invoke his name to cast spells.

While the first half of the book *pages* are devoted to the philosophy of LaVeyan Satanism, the last half of the book *pages* are devoted to the rituals of LaVeyan Satanism. However, in terms of word count, once you get to the 19 [Enochian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian) Keys, half of the pages are blank, the rest are sparsely filled out, and one page is dedicated to the actual Enochian language itself, while another page is dedicated to its translation. Which means about 80% of the book's actual content (word count) is philosophy, and the last 20% is ritual.

So it's no surprise then that when looking at [the back of the book, it's filed under ""Fantasy""](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uG9ex6GxfcVJLi6guxe2Lm0NUADVsnE-mJKgowuK_ZLNPth83FPmTROgMIz9aj2jQmbLc4dHRW6e-ScPUyIHoytVhTTQyB1nRJTp1tzou1cLp3ddTekOlmDwm8aeZ_Rc9pRJFWi7LddXe3B6spYlfOS4ftnQ_q8CxyK4llS1Q6fYi7ebNCZ3lIonoG8CNaIkg4vDHJBanhK43M7TWrtv8gihxbdnSPayt8G9TBaGBebi3pfaa9iWA380ZB2cHfmSQPEDWwqT5E_2spj2czD16AbKWd-vlzxy3AjROeblccmRbMRF1zgK9TB1VLEJKh--aQkRb-GugSXv6xFFZy18NXxTGbZr03FUZyYuu4g-wrlmpLz_Wjswk7N6H2NhHZEsBCwve3-E4hyS6GBLnRHsjtC-c63xQn8M2BGdlEO_jFnZhxTjkPmcY2DbQe3ccF8R36_DFLDvGoiFeDIzDdoRanNimLB8xPIgKofMFdIdHK810uNwdTSsopBiWsmBpvwg5cPdBj7UeFahgnNT1o5PLv0TFrpM0OmQD14e4ke4og-_axiK7PLELo7gFEAVPU4V7q04KzInQEhgXbmGp4GbqJC7KNZZfAj2QzFf6M1eiw4A6YQ7YPJgFwpFFQM-Avzma6F-_y0RWzxHw2U5MtZ9EIaQ26N-p7FsgcyChinOmVltobTJzoPl3a0ufoOv0LoIMAl9w3vFI9K6cRu3mdknL_9PwdjOY0T8t6yq5EvxjDMCMBbetA=w1305-h1095-no). Personally, I wish that would be the case for every religious book that requires the supernatural as part of the foundational tenets of its faith. So at least that is a silver lining to this cloud of irrational occult ""magick"" nonsense.

As a whole, I give it 3 stars, because I appreciate the ego-centered and rational secular philosophies it outlines before getting into the ritual. While I don't agree with everything in those philosophies, it's refreshing to see a counter argument to the world religions of faith, and how they manipulate people with guilt and labels. On the other hand, the whole philosophy is a bit too carnal, too sensual. It's almost too theatrical, as though it's something you would expect to see in an adult carnival. In fact, if you study LaVey's life, you understand why the whole philosophy feels almost like you're watching a carnal theatrical play. It's barely practical in daily life.

That's how this book reads- theatrical and almost obnoxious.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/d1xzyf/my_review_of_the_satanic_bible_by_anton_szandor/,2019-09-09T22:08:57Z,107,185,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
g9o6fm,The Most Overrated Book of All Time? - “The Perks of Being a Wallflower”,"I first read “ The Perks of Being a Wallflower” last year. At the time I was rediscovering coming-of-age as a genre and this book was considered by many to be amongst its highest accomplishments. Needless to say I delved into it’s pages somewhat excited and hopeful. 

The novel is written in a post-modern manner with chapters resembling journal entries. Throughout these chapters every stereotype, cheap writing technique and cliche is utterly exhausted. TPOBAW is incredibly good at separating individuals who truly understand literature from those that wish they did. The techniques and point of view in this book can easily fool an inexperienced reader into thinking the content is something profound and meaningful. I assure everyone that this is not the case. 

The charm of the coming-of-age genre is the relatability and growth of its characters. There are many examples where this genre has done exceptional well at creating awesome characters like (Holden Caulfield - “The Catcher in the Rye), (Hal Incendenza - “Infinite Jest) even (White Mike - “Twelve”). The characters in TPOBAW fail to leave any lasting impression at all and feel more like 2D cut outs of a stereotypical archetype. I have never before felt so little care and affection for any characters in this genre. Any charm has been destroyed by the placement of cheap character arcs and unrealistic scenarios. 

At this point many will say that I am misunderstanding the text and the authors intentions. Maybe that I misunderstand the genre as a whole or prefer more male orientated depictions. This is not the case either. After reading John Green’s novels I feel that he creates much better work than anything within TPOBAW and gives the reader some meaningful ideas, thought provoking sentiment and enjoyable humour along the way. “Looking for Alaska” Is a better novel in all respects than TPOBAW. 

I do not like to appear like i’m hating on a book and I always respect an author even if their work fails. I do feel though that this book has undeservedly received high praise for far too long and been has somehow consistently placed among genuinely great work in various lists. I believe this is ultimately due to a few progressive characters and storylines that are shoe horned into the novel, it’s messy post-modern structure and claims that it was one of the first great novels in this genre. 

To Conclude, there are many books in the coming-of-age genre and ones that existed way before TPOBAW was conceived. “The Catcher in the Rye” is a true masterpiece of 20th century literature, even comparing TPOBAW to this book is criminal. If a reader comes to this genre seeking more challenging and rewarding work “Infinite Jest” will deliver ten fold, if they seek humour and loveable characters, the work of John Green will satisfy. TPOBAW Is proof that for some all it takes to make a classic novel is to write it in an unnecessary post-modern way and fill its pages with progressive plots that lead nowhere, dull stereotypical characters and unrealistic scenarios. This book is without any doubt in my mind, one of the most Overrated of all time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g9o6fm/the_most_overrated_book_of_all_time_the_perks_of/,2020-04-28T14:27:38Z,26,0,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
pkdrjj,My take on the ending of Susanna Clarke's Piranesi,"Whilst I've seen plenty of discussion about this amazing book, in particular the ending and what it may mean, I have not yet seen anybody share my way of seeing it so I thought I might put it out there for discussion.

At the end of the book, the character formally known as Piranesi, formally known as Matthew Rose Sorensen, begins to see people who were depicted in statues in the house appear in our world.

My theory calls back to the idea of the ancient lost knowledge that the Other is devoted to discovering. We learn that in ancient times people lived more as one with the world. Whilst I forget examples, I remember understanding that the world was once more in the mind of a person, giving them greater abilities, whilst in modern day people live in the world as it is - the world has come out on top, almost.

We know that the house has a mental effect on its occupants, possessing the power to change them. My theory is that, in spending so much time in the house, and devoting himself to the upkeep and respect of his new world, Piranesi unlocks this forgotten knowledge which now allows him to have a different relationship with 'our' world when he returns. Perhaps he wishes to see the statues that he misses so much, so the world presents them to him in the form of passers by - and the reason they disappear so soon is because he is yet to fully master and understand his new relationship with the world.

One last sentence that developed this theory is on the final page: ""The city streets rose up around me."" To me, this suggests once more that ancient relationship whereby the world satisfies the mind, rather than vice versa.

Or maybe that's all me overthinking. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pkdrjj/my_take_on_the_ending_of_susanna_clarkes_piranesi/,2021-09-08T16:20:26Z,5,28,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
268g8v,"Hi there. I'm Brian Kevin, author of The Footloose American: Following the Hunter S. Thompson Trail Across South America. AMA!","Hi all. I'm giving this another shot, as I used a shortened link on my first pass, which evidently is not cool.  Mea maxima culpa.

In the last few years, I’ve logged a bunch of miles traveling across South America, retracing the route that a young Hunter S. Thompson took across the continent in 1962 and 1963, while working as a freelance foreign correspondent (mostly for The National Observer). Thompson’s fifty-year-old articles served as my guidebook, in a sense, and I revisited the topics that commanded his attention back then.

I just took my first full-time job this month following eight-ish years as a full-time freelancer, often (not always) focused on travel — some really fulfilling stuff, some not-particularly-glamorous stuff. I’m happy to talk about The Footloose American, young HST in general, South American culture/politics, travel, travel writing, you name it. My website (http://briankevin.com) lists a few interests that have nothing to do with the book, so if you want to talk about, I don’t know, beer or the Grateful Dead, I’m all for that.

I'll be around to answer questions after 3 pm EST. And some proof that I'm me: https://twitter.com/brianMT/status/469548808830214144. Let's do this.

Edit, 6:20 pm: Hey, this is super fun. I'm definitely going to get back to answering the questions I haven't yet, and feel free to keep them coming.  I have to log off for an hour or so and go check in with my wife and kid, and then I'll hop back on tonight for a spell and have at any outstanding questions.  I super appreciate everybody's interest!

Edit: Thanks everybody.  I guess we're about done here.

6luius,"[Spoiler](#s ""Discussions on the endings of books"") Just finished One hundred years of solitude, didn't really like it, but after finishing the last couple of pages, it made me think it's a masterpiece","I am a huge fan of magical realism, huge admirer of the likes of Borges, Bolaño, Cortázar and others, so naturally Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his well known book was on my list for quite a while.

All I knew about the book before I read it was the famous beginning:

""Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.""

I wish I knew how many characters were in it, and how many would have variations on the same name. After a while it was really hard to keep track of all of it.

The names, the meandering storyline (which was nice at first, but could get tiring sometimes), the narrative pace, and the sheer scope... oh the scope. Of five generations, and sometimes callbacks would be made to characters you haven't read about in a hundred pages.

All of this, even though I loved the style, was leaning me more and more as I was approaching the ending to give it a mark of 2, which to me is not a bad book. Just an OK one.

I was even considering putting the book down at about 95% on my Kindle. But I persevered. And what I experienced in the last few pages of the book, the last few paragraphs, of the parchments and the way the future was unfolding in front of the last Aureliano, oh, that was just pure literary porn. The way he wrote those last few pages, which could probably not have had such an effect if they didn't come at the end of such a long journey, that experience made me think of this book as a 4, an excellent piece of literature which I would recommend.

Which made me wonder... Have others gone through a similar experience with a book? What other books need you until the very last moment to repay for your time? Have you ever experienced something similar?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6luius/spoilers_discussions_on_the_endings_of_books_just/,2017-07-07T15:49:02Z,5,5,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
4vzddz,Comparing Buried Giant with The Last Unicorn,"I just finished reading the Buried Giant by Kazou Ishiguro yesterday and am in love with it. I found it to be a beautiful and haunting book, the kind of book that makes me feel melancholy and strangely nostalgic. I was trying to place what about the book's tone and even the characters felt so familiar and realized I was reminded of The Last Unicorn. In looking at other discussion surrounding The Buried Giant, I didn't notice anyone bringing this up and was wondering if anyone else noticed it. 

My reasons for this:

* There truly is no happy ending. As memories as revealed and quests conclude, there is no real sense of a satisfying completion. It reminds me of what Schmendrick says: ""There are no happy endings because nothing ends.""
* Characters are both clearly and simply motivated but well developed. In The Last Unicorn, The Unicorn/Amalthea wants to find the other unicorns, Schmendrick wishes to become a real magician, etc. But on top of these motivations, we see the characters have depth, sorrows, and regrets. For example, Molly has always wanted to meet a real unicorn but becomes enraged when she does as she has now become old. Likewise, in the Buried Giant, the old couple want to find their son, the Saxon warrior wishes to find and slay the dragon, etc. However, due to everyone's lost/murky memories, there is of course more going on there than we realize and some of the characters have much more complicated histories than we realize, like Wistan and Axl. 
* There is overall feeling of sadness in the book. At times, in both Buried Giant and Last Unicorn, characters seemed resigned, doing not necessarily what they may want to do but what has to be done. There is a recognition of needing to fulfill their purpose but at times they seem to not take much joy in the fact. Prince Lir's speech about the role of what heroes do perfectly captures that. Ishiguro's characters similarly seem to sometimes be resigned to do their duties as well but see no reason to try and resist. I especially saw this at the end of the book when Wistan fulfilled his quest though there are also a few moments when we see what appears to be Axl's hesitation as well.

Maybe this is a bit of a stretch, maybe I just want to link this new book to one of my all-time favorites. I'd love to hear what other people think on this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4vzddz/comparing_buried_giant_with_the_last_unicorn/,2016-08-03T16:29:51Z,6,5,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
gjbzgt,The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle - Haruki Murakami,"This book might just have motivated me to start reading again.

It's been maybe 2 or 3 years since the last time I read a book in my own time, as I'm currently majoring in English Literature: the sheer volume of reading I have to do for class requirements has really drained my motivation to explore books in my own time.

I (19M) bought it from a local secondhand independent bookstore about 2 months back, and about 2 chapters in I stopped reading. Again, exams and such and just general lack of motivation to commit to a full length novel all sort of piled up and just kept me from getting into it. But what with the quarantine going on, there hasn't been much else to do and I figured it'd be more productive than playing video games all day. So last night I sat down, really started reading and suddenly found I couldn't stop. I stayed up until about 3 in the morning just to finish the novel because it drew me in so much, a feeling I haven't had in far too long; a feeling I didn't realise I missed. 

This was my first Murakami novel and I was totally unprepared for the kind of experience it became, and I'd really like to describe it as that: more an ""experience"" than a ""read"". That isn't to say the writing is subpar; quite the opposite. As I read through the novel, the pacing and storytelling was so vivid and carefully crafted I couldn't help but be drawn into this whole other world I had never in my life encountered. It felt less as if I were reading a novel and more like I was there, in person, in some kind of omniscient point of view. My emotions pulled along, my imagination stretched to it's limits, Murakami got me to really suspend my disbelief at everything happening whether it be natural or supernatural and take it at face value. I wanted it to be true, it HAD to be true; everything in the novel was more real to me than my physical exhaustion at staying up. 

I will warn any potential readers though; this isn't a ""happy"" book. It engages a lot with concepts of fatalism and fate, of events out of one's control. It's a story that's setting seems so mundane and common that you're coerced into comparing your own personal life setting to that of the novel; and in doing so forces you to be a little introspective and consider your own life as part of this network of fate, as every event and opportunity as predetermined and almost planned by some greater force. IF you're prepared for that kind of introspection, I highly recommend this book. It's written beautifully (or rather translated beautifully) and I wish I had the aptitude to read this in it's original language; undoubtedly it would be a different experience, perhaps one with more nuance that isn't translated across the language barrier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gjbzgt/the_windup_bird_chronicle_haruki_murakami/,2020-05-14T00:54:50Z,12,29,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
3i5rv3,"""Knowledge is knowing that Frankenstein is not the monster. Wisdom is knowing that Frankenstein is the monster."" Can we discuss this?","Hey /r/books, I've recently finished re-reading Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein.* I've read this book three times so far, each at different stages of my life, and each time I'm always blown away by how engaging and intelligent it is. This last time I read the book, however, was the first time I've gone into it with the titular ""knowledge/wisdom"" quote in mind. As I was reading, I was actively trying to look for evidence to justify Victor Frankenstein as a monster.

Long story short, I simply couldn't view Frankenstein as a monster. You could fault him for hubris, for sure, and I would absolutely call him a coward, but I think ""monster"" is unfair, even melodramatic.

What, exactly, does Victor Frankenstein do that readers would label him monstrous? I discussed this briefly with my dad, who could only offer that Frankenstein is a monster because he attempts to play God. I'm not buying this, one because I'd call that hubristic more than monstrous, and two because Frankenstein immediately and consistently demonstrates profound regret for creating his monster--hell, he even sticks to his guns and refuses to create a mate, knowing now what a terrible idea that is. Is he monstrous because he abandons his newborn creature, viewing him with disgust? Well, sure, that's undeniably a shitty thing to do, but I think to call him a ""monster"" for this goes too far.

The more ways I consider that Frankenstein could possibly be viewed as a monster (he doesn't come forward with the truth about William's death? he doesn't warn Elizabeth or any other family members about his creation?), the more I view him with a sense of... really tragic sympathy, I guess I'd call it. I believe absolutely that Frankenstein is a pure, weakly coward, but I think what holds me back from the ""monster"" label is that he never intends to harm anyone, not even his creature (at least not before the creature starts killing his loved ones). He just... makes a series of unfortunate, stupid, and, of course, cowardly decisions that end up hurting people, and I can't help but sympathize with that. Who among us hasn't regretted a decision made in short-sighted pride, who hasn't feared the fallout and tried simply wishing it away?

88w03h,I just finished reading the first book from the three body problem trilogy,"So I just finished reading the first book from the three body problem trilogy and I must say that after all the hype I read about the book and that made me pick it up, I was left a bit disappointed as I turned the last page. On the plus side, the story is amazing, I did enjoy a lot of the characters (especially Da Shi) and there are so much imagination in this book that I really wasn't bored at all reading it, I enjoyed the whole journey. However, I felt that there were so many missed opportunities that it made me cringed in disapointment several times, I wish the book had more philosophical depth and discussions, and also for a book that aims at criticizing humanity as a whole, I felt that it was way too much anthropocentric and anthropomorphic. As much as I enjoyed the story and the plot, I feel let down by the shallowness of many dialogues, it just misses that little something that would have make it a truly great roman.

2ha05b,"Our family name is very similar to ""Tolkien."" In 1973 my uncle wrote a letter to the author himself. He wrote back. Here's the letter and story!","[Here is the letter](http://i.imgur.com/YcY5kP3.png) and here is my uncle's story:

*In June 1973 I was in London, about to hitchhike north, and got up the courage to write a fan letter to my favorite author asking if I could visit him on my way through Oxford. Two days later I got this letter, which I am posting in honor of September 22nd, a very important date in the imaginary universe of the author’s creation. Three months after I got the letter the author boarded an elven ship at the Gray Havens and sailed westward to Valinor, never to be seen again in these mortal lands.*

And here is a transcript of the letter, since it's a bit hard to read:

> **Dear Mr. Tolkin**,
> 
> Thank you very much for your very kind letter. As you have taken such great pleasure in my books, and also have a last name* which is probably in origin the same as my own, I should have been very pleased to see you. But the university term is now approaching its end, and since as an old man I find it very exhausting I shall shortly be going away, or ‘down’ as we call it, and shan’t be returning to Oxford for some time.

8hpkwm,Adults who have re-read/read Harry Potter recently - how would you rank the novels? What are your thoughts reading them as an adult?,"Like a lot of people on this sub, I grew up reading HP and was pretty much the same age as the characters as each book came out. HP was a huge part of my life and was instrumental in developing and growing my love of reading to more serious and diverse literature.

I recently re-read the novels and would rank them as such:

1. Half-Blood Prince: I don't often see this one as anyone's favourite but I've always loved the really mysterious and brooding atmosphere in this one. It's fairly low-key for being the penultimate book in the franchise and I enjoyed the detective-like story of discovering Voldemort's past and finding the Horcruxes. The sequence in the sea cave where Harry and Dumbledore encounter the Inferi is probably favourite set piece in the entire series. Also, Dumbledore's absolutely fucking wrecked me, as it did pretty much everyone who was 

2. Prisoner of Azkaban: The best self-contained story in the series imo. The Dementors have never been as scary as they are in PoA and the time-travel mechanic is cool af. Also introduces Lupin and Sirius, 2 of the best characters in the franchise. Also the Marauder's Map, one of my favourite magical concepts Rowling created

3. Deathly Hallows: Yeah, it drags a bit in the middle but I actually liked how it almost felt like 2 books in one - the first part a slow, grim chase that escalates into the epic battle for Hogwarts. This book has 2 of the coolest scenes in the series - the first being Harry and Hermione's detour to Godric's Hollow and then the Gringotts dragon escape. I didn't like the epilogue but I thought the conclusion was satisfying otherwise

4. Goblet of Fire: The 4th book is also the middle of the pack for me as far as the series as a whole is concerned. This is when the narrative started to come together as a continuing story. The triwizard tournament sequences were fantastic - especially the 2nd underwater challenge, and the twist with Barty Crouch Jr blew my mind when I read it

5. Chamber of Secrets: I appreciated how dark this one got for being a simple ""children's tale"" as the first 2 books were designated. The voices from the walls and the students turning to stone are both really creepy, and the final encounter with the Basilisk is pretty awesome. I didn't like Gildeory Lockhart though, and there were one too many info dumps explaining events from the first book

6. Philosopher's Stone: Ah, where it all started. I still get a massive dose of nostalgia every time I think about this one. It's still pretty fantastic, albeit a little simplistic and sparse, as it really is just an introduction to Rowling's universe

7. Order of the Phoenix: I remember this being a bit of a slog when I read it the first time, and although I liked it more at 27 than I did at 13 when I first read it, it's middle third is not the greatest and Harry is frankly an annoying twit for most of it. Umbridge is absolutely fantastic though and pretty much carries this book. I really wish we could have some Quidditch though as I've loved always reading about the matches. Sirius' death is still as painful as it ever was, although the DUmbledore vs Voldemort battle wasn't as epic as it could have been

Reading through these books, although the prose is just functional (much better in the later books though) and if you really wanted, you could nitpick the hell out of the plot holes in the worldbuilding, it really struck me once again at just how vital and creative Rowling's imagination was. I have read hundreds of books across all genres since I finished Deathly Hallows 10 years ago, but I don't remember ever coming across a universe I wanted so much to be real and be a part of. I think that's really the greatest strength of these books - you so very much wish that Hogwarts and the magical world were real and that you could be a part of it. 

Rowling also wasn't afraid to add real darkness to her books, especially in the last 3, which became increasing bleaker and grimmer as they went replacing the whimsy of the first books. You could almost see this as an allegory for growing up - life gets harder and the world seems more cruel but you keep fighting. The depth and detail in the narrative is astonishing and other than Middle Earth, feels like the most fleshed-out fantasy kingdom I've ever read about. That's not even mentioning the amazing characters, the wonderful set-pieces that the movies could never do justice to as much as your own imagination and the sheer joy of making the discoveries along with the characters.

IMO the series has held up very, very well, and it will absolutely be one of the first books I will be introducing to my own kids when they grow up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8hpkwm/adults_who_have_rereadread_harry_potter_recently/,2018-05-07T18:07:58Z,51,53,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
e76oom,"When I was 12, I fell in love with Science Fiction reading Isaac Asimov. It made this find stuck between the pages of a used copy of his autobiography even more special.","Last year I decided now that I'm a grown adult with a child at home, I wanted to begin a real collection of books by my favorite authors so my daughter will have a library to explore in her home like I did when I was a kid. I've been grabbing things by my favorite authors at used book stores since then.

One author I've been focusing on is Isaac Asimov. I started my lifelong love of all things SF when I read *I, Robot* in Middle School. My High School years were spent devouring all his Robot novels, then on to Foundation, his Empire series, and on and on. Asimov lead me to Clark, Niven, Heinlein, Clement, LeGuinn and I've never stopped. I now teach Physics and it's because I was inspired to a love of science and space by all of these amazing writers. But Asimov keeps a special place in my heart as the start of it all.

The other week at a used bookstore I saw a copy of the first volume of Asimov's autobiography, *In Memory Yet Green*. I grabbed it for my collection, excited it was a first edition, though it's not particularly rare or valuable. 

When I got home I found some things were stuck between the pages. Upon exploration I found these:

I also found [a stamp on the inside page](https://imgur.com/T5X5Fgm) put in by the previous owner. Seems the book belonged to someone named [Dan C. Ryan](https://imgur.com/CEOlTcw).

I have no idea who Dan C. Ryan is, but if he saved these clippings of Asimov and preserved them in the book, then he must have been profoundly affected by Asimov just like me. It gave me a really cool sense of connection with the person who owned the book. 

I find it hard to believe that someone who took such care to curate clippings in the book gave it away, so I imagine it was sold with his estate when he died. Maybe not, but I think it's a safe bet. I wish Dan could know that his book went to someone who also loved the work of Asimov and will cherish it just like he seemed to have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/e76oom/when_i_was_12_i_fell_in_love_with_science_fiction/,2019-12-06T23:51:03Z,16,133,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
ewr5pw,Stephen King’s ‘The Institute’ - My Thoughts (Spoilers),"Before reading this, I wasn’t much of a reader. I’m 17 and haven’t read many books. Only started some but never finished. ‘The Institute’ is the first book I’ve finished. I’ve never really been into reading much because I’ve always found it boring. But the reason I found it so boring was so blatantly obvious! I wasn’t reading the genres I enjoyed. I tried reading Percy Jackson (can’t remember which one, it was years ago) and it was..meh. Couldn’t really get into it. 

I’m new to Stephen King. Yes, I know who he is and I’m aware of the books he’s written and how many there are but ‘The Institute’ was the first one I read of his. 

Back in September last year I saw a tweet on Twitter from Stephen King that his new book ‘The Institute’ was out and I thought to myself, ooh! That word, that title sounds interesting. 

Then came October and I was going on holiday. I saw ‘The Institute’ on the shelf in the bookstore and I had to pick it up. I did, and I Immediately started reading it. 

You might be wondering why I’m only just writing this when I picked the book up in October. It’s because I stopped reading it for almost a month. I read a lot, then got to a point where (I have to admit this) I got bored and couldn’t read anymore. However, I started reading the reviews and to sum it up, they said the buildup was worth it. Oh yeah, it was. I’m a slow reader, I tend to read a page in 1/2 minutes. I picked the book up again around late November and I finally finished it today. 

I’m going to be talking about thoughts as they come to me, they won’t be in logical order. 

I absolutely loved it. 

The fact that over 800,000 children are abducted every year shocked me. I guessed what this story was going to be about and that was one thing that got me into it. 

The opening hooked me on right away. I was interested in Tim’s journey from the the plane to the Motel. And then came Luke who I adored. 

I loved the relationship between every single character. God, I miss them! 

I especially miss Avery. I cried when he died. That last line really hit me. I was so invested in his character, so intrigued to see whether he would make it out alive or not...and he didn’t. I’ll talk about this later. 

It was horrid knowing Luke didn’t have any family left because those assholes killed them but it was so wonderful that Tim looked after him, I just loved their relationship. 

Mrs Sigsby was a total bitch, obviously. Same with Stackhouse and all the other heartless, bastards that abused the kids. 

I’m so glad the kids retaliated and fought their way out as much as they could. Yes, not all of them got out but not everyone could. They were so brave and so determined to fight their way through it, I liked that.

A lot of it was very sad. However, there were a few moments that I found genuinely hilarious. Some times I laughed for a good 30 seconds, loved it. 

When Luke escaped, that was incredible. He had to injure himself, but he was so resilient to leave, he did not stop, he did not give up, he kept digging and pulling himself until he was out. And he just ran for it. Good on him! 

The ending was good but sad. Nostalgic. Honestly, I would have just shot Mr Smith right on the spot. The kids and Tim had more patience than I would have. I didn’t care what he had to say, the moment I heard his lisp and got out of the car, he’d be lying in his own blood. 

When Luke remembered Kalisha and Avery. The first time they met, that hit me. I remembered reading the part where they met in the corridor. Filled my eyes with water. 

Luke and Avery share joint position in being my favourite characters. 

What I wish had happened, was for the story to get out instead of Tim telling the kids to seal their lips. I wish the world could know their story and for every single one of those evil bastards to be brought to justice. 

It’s Stephen King, so of course it’s going to be damn good. It was a joy to read, was sad and funny. I didn’t want it to end. I don’t know if he’s writing something similar but I’d love to see a sequel considering Mr Lisp is still alive. 

I’m planning on reading ‘The Outsider’ next, but I’m also thinking about ‘Elevation’ or the gunslinger series. What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ewr5pw/stephen_kings_the_institute_my_thoughts_spoilers/,2020-01-31T16:47:59Z,15,9,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
dk6un9,My thoughts on The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohlleben,"I’m mostly writing this for my own sake, but please feel free to read my thoughts on this book and respond with some of your own :)


I enjoyed it! I read this book as a reaction to being moved by the Overstory by Richard Powers. THLOT is the real world counterpart to a book that one of the Overstory’s character’s writes. That book then plays a major role in the story. I was drawn to read THLOT out of an interest in the topic, a desire to read more non-fiction, and a desire to increase my familiarity with the characters in the Overstory. 
	The writing was subpar, but Wohlleben’s enthusiasm was obvious. I guess it’s problematic to compare the Overstory and thlot so much, but what the Overstory lacked in scientific detail (not much) it made up for in the beauty of its prose. I guess I think of Wohlleben as a scientist first and a writer second, but I wish that the language was a little stronger. It felt overly simplified, even bridging on condescension. That being said, I appreciated the bite sized chapters. The book is essentially a dump of information so being able to read a few pages, set it down, and then pick it up again was really easy. I wish some of the scientific processes were explained in better detail. Maybe they weren’t because we don’t know the science of how or why these natural phenomena take place. But at least it would’ve been nice if the book explained more than just stating. Finally, I thought the book was too long. He repeated himself a lot and the book’s energy started to drag in the last 75 or so pages. 
	

The content of the book is however, absolutely fascinating. Wohlleben has obviously devoted his life to understanding the trees and has discovered so much. This alone is what makes the book so incredible. It is clear that the science that he studies is his life passion. If you can empathize with the authors devotion and enthusiasm, the book will begin to reveal itself to you in fuller beauty. This is what the Overstory did so well, it took most of the essential information in THLOT and put in context, in the hands of passionate interesting people. THLOT was still eye opening. Do not think that by reading the Overstory you know pretty much all of what Wohlleben reveals in thlot. 
	

It was overall a very rewarding experience. Reading it enhanced the way I see the world around me. I encourage anyone reading it to stop in between chapters and let the information sink in. Imagine you’re reading the book at the top of a 2000 year old redwood. Take your time with it. Maybe find a tree to read under.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dk6un9/my_thoughts_on_the_hidden_life_of_trees_by_peter/,2019-10-19T17:29:15Z,8,22,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
hzp9u1,The Masculine Archetypes: King Warrior Magician Lover,"Questioning masculinity has been the trend for the last few decades. Toxic masculinity is the buzzword of the last few years and with valid reasons.

What happened to positive masculinity, what does that even mean? What if true, fully realized masculinity has never been a thing in the entirety of
human history? 

According to Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette, the male psyche can be divided into four archetypes of masculinity that represent our different drives.
The King, the Warrior, the Magician, and the Lover. 

The King embodies the greatest aspect of masculinity, his wish for himself and his people to prosper. He influences himself and others to achieve
things they never thought would be possible. The shadow aspect of this is the tyrant who uses his power to opress others(and ultimately himself)
and protect his position.

The Warrior is probably the most infamous of the archetypes as it has been manifested in its negative form for thousands of years. Men have
this drive to conquer and achieve, this is where our ambition and aggression stems from. It can be used in combination with the King energy to drive humanity forward and fight battles for the good of all or to oppress, dominate, and subjugate others.

The Magician is where our love for intellectual pursuits, knowledge, and understanding comes from. It fuels our drive to invent and conquer technology
to improve all of our lives. It can also turn into ego and hiding knowledge and technology to enrich ourselves and take from those who don't have access
to said knowledge.

The Lover is the most hidden archetype that's starting to surface more and more as we become a more integrated society. It connects us to our emotions
and the sensual side of life. Most men repress their feelings and force themselves to act stoic in all situations and mostly express their negative emotions
in the form of anger. Women are a lot better than us at expressing their full panel of emotions.

Men have an incredibly diverse psyche with a lot of hidden sides that can be repressed and turn into negative masculine expression which gives us
the toxic masculinity that is being called out these days. Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette's book King Warrior Magician Lover breaks this down in both
a spiritual but modern context giving us examples of lawyers, doctors and accountants repressing their emotions and using their knowledge from a selfish insecurity
and gives us inspiration for a new wave of integrated men. 

I'm curious if anyone here has read this or heard about it? I've not seen it mentioned anywhere but I'd definitely recommend every men out there and the women that love them give it a read. I'd love to hear thoughts on it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hzp9u1/the_masculine_archetypes_king_warrior_magician/,2020-07-28T23:10:08Z,7,17,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

174gysz,"the problems i faced when i started translating "" between the acts "" by virginia woolf - PART5","hello again my friends, have you forgotten me? a little introduction to refresh your memory then, i'm a novelist and a translator, i'm translating virginia woolf last novel into arabic, but i'm not a native speaker, i'm still a learner, i'm good at english, but not good enough, as for Arabic though, you can try me, anyway, as always i have a bunch of puzzling questions that need answers, thanks in advance to all those who help to make the english literature known to the arabic reader ( not  just arabs here, but those who speak arabic but not arab as well )...

1 - in this passage :

"" nor did her figure, seen against the dark roll of trousering in a shop window, please her.   
Thick of waist, large of limb, and, save for her hair, fashionable in the tight modern way, she never looked like Sappho, or one of the beautiful young men whose photographs""

What does it mean to have a tight hairstyle? Can somebody provide a link to an image in the comments? It would be better if the image is from that time.

2 - Is she wishing to have the appearance of men?

3  - in this passage : ""Books are the mirrors of the soul.""  
In this case a tarnished, a spotted soul. For as the train took over three hours to reach this remote village in the very heart of England.

Does 'tarnished' here mean that there was dust on the books, or did the shiny appearance of the newly bought books disappear during the train travel?

4 - also in this passage : ""Nobody could pretend, as they looked at the shuffle of shilling shockers that week-enders had dropped"" 

this is what i got out of this... his woman, who lives in a remote village, asks people who come to visit (weekenders?) to bring books of their choosing. I looked up the meaning of 'shuffle' and found that it means, among other things, to mix randomly. Is this the correct meaning? The people she requested books from choose books randomly, which is why they sometimes bring cheap novels with them.""

5 - now this passage is so beatiful but i have a problem in the last line in it : 

""The fire greyed, then glowed, and the tortoiseshell butterfly beat on the lower pane   
of the window; beat, beat, beat; repeating that if no human being ever   
came, never, never, never, the books would be mouldy, the fire out and the   
tortoiseshell butterfly dead on the pane"" 

I understand the writer's perspective that the fire and the books would cease to exist or be ruined without human intervention. However, I'm wondering why the butterfly would be dead?

6 -""  the dog at his feet--the Afghan hound. His nose on his paws, his haunches drawn up, he looked a stone dog, a crusader's dog guarding even in the realms of death the sleep of his master."" 

I didn't quite understand the position the dog is in here. I'm more of a cat person and not around dogs too often. When you mention 'his haunches up,' does it mean his head is on the ground, and he's raising his back, similar to how cats stretch? As for the 'stone dog' and the 'crusader's dog,' I did some research, and in some cultures, there are stone dogs or similar creatures believed to ward off evil spirits. Is this what is being referred to here? Additionally, I couldn't find any specific historical reference to 'crusader's dogs.' Did crusader soldiers have dogs?

7 - ""But the master was not dead; only dreaming; drowsily, seeing as in a glass, its lustre   
spotted, himself, a young man helmeted; and a cascade falling. But no water; and the hills, like grey stuff pleated; and in the sand a hoop of ribs"" 

a cascade falling  but no water? lemme picture that... a few hours later... my imagination commited suicide she was so confident  in its skill which was hoaned and sharpened through reading a lot of fiction until virginia woolf came and hurt its ego, she couln't live with failure so... where am i going with this?... what the hell is cascade with no water, it's like saying rainbow with no colors, or is it meant that that there was a cascade path where the water used to fall from but it was dry? alright, forgive my  utmost stupidity...

8 - a hoop of ribs is like the leftovers of corpses, right, is he walking through a battle field or something similar?

9 - "" a bullock maggot-eaten in the sun; and in the shadow of the rock, savages; and in his hand a gun. The dream hand clenched; the real hand lay on the chair arm, the veins swollen but only with a brownish fluid now. "" 

so here what is the brownish fluid exactly? also the contrast between the dream hand and the real hand is so amazing, i wrote about dreams a lot  but never tried that before

10 - The door opened.  
""Am I,"" Isa apologized, ""interrupting?""  
Of course she was--destroying youth and India. It was his fault, since she had persisted in stretching his thread of life so fine, so far. Indeed he was grateful to her, watching her as she strolled about the room, for continuing.Many old men had only their India--old men in clubs, old men in rooms off Jermyn Street. She in her striped dress continued him"" 

so here "" she had presisted in stretching his thread of life "" and ""she continued him"" is he talking about the offspring, like the idea of the person dies but the kind continue living, and you spread your genes so you continue living as part of your decendents, it's like a way to survive death, i think it's a stupid way to cling to life, and i think you die when you die doesn't matter how many children you have or what your great accomplisments that you'll be remembered through them,  because you won't have a conncetion to this world so you would feel anything or hear anything from this world anymore, you're just in a diffrent domain, but doesn't matter what my beliefs are right? so the question is  : is this what is meant by those expressions?

11 - ""The library's always the nicest room in the house,"" she quoted"" 

did she just quoted herself? can you do that? because that' her phrase, she came up with it.

anyway, that's it for this post, thank you all to those who answered my previous posts, and to those who will answer my future posts, gotta make sure i don't forget anyone, til the next one

2w4pkz,I can't be the only person who dislikes series books.,"Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person who doesn't have a favorite ""series."" I've read a couple, but I don't prefer them. I like books to be full and complete and have closure. 

One of the problems I come across because of this is that it feels like it's SO HARD to find any books that AREN'T part of a series anymore. I'll peruse Amazon's book lists to find something new to read, come across something that looks interesting, only to see that dreaded (____ #4) next to it, indicating the series name and book number. 

I guess on one hand, it's nice to close a book and know that your favorite characters will return to you again in the next book. On the other, it feels like such an investment. If I'm going to read a series, I'm going to want to read the whole series - but it seems like often times, it's like TV or movies where the last few seasons or sequels never live up to the first; then you're left wishing you stopped before it got so bad (see: Dexter).

Anyone else feel like this? Are there any series that are worth it for the entire series?

fgqlej,About done with this month’s book club selection “The Grace of Kings”,"Without spoiling it for anyone I have to say that this story is truly epic in scope... perhaps to a fault....

Honestly I wished the author had divided this in at least two books. There is simply **too much** being covered in this tome... and apparently the second book (already put on hold in my library) is **even longer**.

If someone tried to adapt this to a TV series this would be one of those strange cases where a single tome less than 700 pages long could potentially last for more than two seasons.

The factions and characters at the end of the book simply don’t resemble what we started with at all.

And while I like epic fantasy, I feel like the pacing has been all over the place which is how we get such a long epic delivered in what seems like a short book considering the amount of important events and characters in the story.

I should be done with it tomorrow. Hopefully the finale is awesome enough to justify the 20+ hours sinked into this epic novel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fgqlej/about_done_with_this_months_book_club_selection/,2020-03-11T03:16:20Z,0,6,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
wiiryn,I finally finished reading Gone with the Wind. Someone explain to me why it deserved a Pulitzer Prize. **SPOILERS**,"So, I used to be a really avid reader. But I returned to school as an adult for mechanical engineering, so didn't have much time for recreational reading anymore.

I now have more time to read again now that I have graduated and decided I wanted to read some classics, that more or less are recognized as significant literally works. So the last book I just decided to read was 'Gone with the Wind'.

I could write a really long review, as this book is nearly a 1000 pages long but if I had to make a quick summation of it I would only have to say that it was by far the most painful book to pick up everyday. Scarlett O'Hara is by far the worst main character from any book I have ever read. She is a self absorbed sociopath who is calculating and manipulative to every person she comes into contact with. Her own disregard for her own children, who she clearly loathes and hates being responsible for really made me upset and angry. This person couldn't have cared less about the well being of her kids, who just continued to have more simply to advance her social status or to manipulate one of her husbands. It was really hard to open this book everyday and know that it was going to be chapter after chapter of reading about her horrible decisions and totally hypocritical attitude. Her desire for social status, making money, revenge and destroying other people's lives simply so she pretend to be a hero and save her family's house and land after the end of the civil war was all she really wanted or cared about.

The only redeeming part of this book is Rhett Butler. He is the only person in the book that puts Scarlett in her place with his cool, hardened logic. I wish the book focused more on Rhett than Scarlett because he at least seemed to have a good grip on the reality of the world at that time and place. He was a great contrast to Scarlett and I was actually happy at the end that he ends up heart broken and sad that in the end, nothing he could do would ever make Scarlett love him as much as she loved herself and she really always wanted Ashley more than she ever wanted him. It was only fitting to me that he leave her. It was the one moment, at the very end of the book where I felt like in some way, Scarlett finally got what was coming to her.

And now on to the racism. I have never read a more racist book than GWTW. This book is clearly sympathetic to the 'old way of the south' and the racist undertones that come along with that statement. It was really disgusting that the book clearly tries to portray a world where black people would rather be slaves, were not smart enough to learn to do things on their own and were better off being controlled by slave owners because they were lazy and not smart enough to adapt to their society. It is really repulsive that this book constantly plays off these themes and constantly degrades black people and insists that free negroes are bad negroes, who have no place having any kind of rights deserving of actual humans. I really can't understand how a book that is so obviously racist and sympathetic to the confederates and their ideologies can win a Pulitzer prize. This is completely shocking to me. 

I could make a much longer and more detailed review, but this has already been done by other people (who have gone far more in depth and detail) but just wanted to give my thoughts on a book that is set before, during and after the civil war. As a Native American I found this book appalling and really wouldn't recommend reading it unless you want to use it as an example of book saturated racist ideologies, an overly romanticized version of the civil war / reconstruction and case study in sociopathy and manipulative behavior.

This is my first post here so I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this. I just felt pretty strong emotions during and after this reading so I just wanted to put my thoughts down and would be interested in hearing other people's comments, or how this book made them feel. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wiiryn/i_finally_finished_reading_gone_with_the_wind/,2022-08-07T15:47:42Z,41,0,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
8ltdsd,"Finished ""I'll be gone in the dark"" and think it was too dramatized.","The topic it covers is already so complicated with so many pieces. And yet, the writer / editor thought it was a good idea to present the story in a ""thriller"" movie script way, jumping back n forth in time and what not. It didn't need artificial suspense creation and didn't need to be sensationalized. Before long, I lost track of sequence of events and treated all subsequent crime descriptions as ""just another attack"". By the time I finished part one, I was actually very infuriated at the way the events were presented. Right before this book, I had read *Killer of the Flower Moon*, another last century true-crime nonfiction. That book had everything described chronologically and was super engaging and easy to grasp. Wish this book was more like that.

For what it's worth, I am still glad that I read this book because now I know about this part of history, something that I didn't know before. Given the recent capture of the GSK using the genealogy method mentioned in the finishing chapters of the book, I am guessing there should be an updated version of this book soon. I would love to read that.

If you have read this book, what's your take on it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8ltdsd/finished_ill_be_gone_in_the_dark_and_think_it_was/,2018-05-24T15:10:12Z,8,6,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
13e9m1t,The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt,"In spite of its purported nihilism, its thesis is that of a hallmark greeting card: good things can come of bad, life is short and pointless but we must go on, beauty and art are worth dying for.

There's a lot of stuff about choosing to progress up the corporate ladder vs throwing it all away and living free of society's fetters. This is quaint and privileged stuff coming after the 2008 financial crisis. But in Tartt's defense, she does write about privileged people for whom that choice is not necessarily fictitious.

Anyway, I like this book so much even though I kind of wanted to hate it? And then I realized why when I recalled what Orwell said about Dickens: ""all fragments, all details — rotten architecture, but wonderful gargoyles."" 

Like Dickens, Tartt is no revolutionary. In the moral philosophy of The Goldfinch, the society we live in and its institutions are fundamentally good, and any bad that happens is because of some amorphous causeless evil. But while I think this is very much a naive navel gazing way to look a things, and the book's plot is silly to the point of incomprehensibility, Tartt's ""gargoyles"" are indeed wonderful.

Not a single character doesn't ring true to type, but my hands down favorite is Xandra. In my mind I envision her physically as a younger Brigitte Macron: tanned, blond, stylish, beady eyed with a snub nose. Cute, sexy, but not exactly conventionally beautiful. I love how resilient Xandra is. In spite of her airhead leathery exterior, she is a good person, really genuine. I can almost taste the fried foods she brings home from her restaurant job. 

I was annoyed by Theo's endless maunderings about Pippa which imo could have been edited and pared down by A LOT. But during Pippa's dinner with Theo, when she talked about her failed ambitions, it was really heartbreaking and so relatable. I wish Tartt had given her more space in the book.

Theo's Dad and Andy's Dad were really helpful to read about. People are conditioned to think of parents as responsible, helpful and loving in relation to their children. But parents are just people with their flaws and pre-existing mental illnesses, criminal dishonesty, love of gambling and disregard for the well being of others including their own children. 

What I found interesting in Tartt's portrayal of Theo's Dad and Andy's Dad is that neither of them are the least bit malicious. Even though they did enormous harm to those around them, it was all unintentional. It is fairly obvious they were barely aware that there are other people in the universe other than themselves. They symbolize the universe itself in their absolute indifference to all and sundry.

Hobie and Mrs. Barbour, as types of the kindly rich, are perfect and adorable. I like how Tartt did not make Mrs. Barbour out to be some ice cold Society bitch. Her vulnerability really comes across. 

I'm conflicted about Boris. Weirdly enough I did know somebody like Boris and Tartt is again on point with her portrayal of Boris and his immigrant crew, imo. But while I was initially amused by Tartt's rendition of Boris' immigrant English, it eventually began to grate on my nerves. Like in the last few chapters when Tartt gave Boris the stage, it was a little too much. A character like Boris is best taken in limited doses, too much of Boris at once makes the book seem fake. I began to see not Boris the person but Donna Tartt the writer reveling in her portrayal of Boris the character. Not good.

The only characters that rang a bit false to me were the doormen at the building where Theo and his mom lived before the accident. They came across as almost like caricatures of the The Kindly Minorities stereotype. It was a bit cringing. 

The plot is ridiculous and I'm inclined to say there was no plot, Tartt was winging it, making shit up as she went along. And this being a Tartt book, we must have our noir references. The shadows converging in on the character as they sit silently freaking out, the cigarette smoke in a dark hotel room, etc. The convoluted plot is also a hallmark of the film noir of the 1940s. The Amsterdam episode where they go to get the painting is a wink-wink-nudge-nudge reference to all the incomprehensible film noir plots that were never intended to make sense. Maybe that kind of thing worked on film or pulp fiction, but in a piece of upscale literary fiction like The Goldfinch, it stood out like a sore thumb. 

So yeah, rotten architecture but wonderful gargoyles. If Tartt was more prolific, she could very well be our very own Dickens. Another similarity to Dickens is that she's one of those writers who improves with age like wine. I loved The Secret History and The Goldfinch is an even greater book than The Secret History. I can't wait to read her next book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13e9m1t/the_goldfinch_by_donna_tartt/,2023-05-11T01:37:55Z,12,19,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy

bdcemh,Is the metamorphosis by Franz Kafka about depression?," The last time I read metamorphosis I was still in my teens and didn't think much of it at the time, just a story about a person turning into an insect. However, upon reading it recently (the English translation of it), I got really strong vibes about depression from it. To clarify, the protagonist exhibits a lot of traits that I've struggled with too and I think fall into the ambit of behavior that is exhibited by people who are depressed. He ceases to have an interest in what he eats, becomes intensely reclusive, ceases to care about any sort of cleanliness surrounding him, loses interest in the life he had before he transformed (apart from fleeting existential crisis that occur such as when his room is being cleaned). Even the behavior exhibited by his family members is hauntingly close to what people around one may exhibit when one ceases to be functional. The protagonist remains a burden on his family who are horrified at his transformation and for the most part have accepted him as dead. His words are incomprehensible by them (perhaps akin to ramblings of a seriously mentally disturbed person) and his family members wish for him to just die or go away by the end so they can stop being weighed down by him and move on with their lives. Further evidence which supports this claim in my opinion, although I'm a bit unsure of this is that when initially the protagonist's manager comes to check up on him, the protagonist's mother mentions that her son rarely ventures out and has any other interests apart from work. And even in terms of his earnings it is evident that the protagonist spends almost nothing on himself as he mentions in the third quarter of the book that he has willingly taken up the expenses of his entire family leaving only a few florins for himself. Not only that, during the course of the entire story, not even one person with a relationship to the protagonist comes to check up on him. No friends, lovers, acquaintances. Since his existence is kept extremely secret, it is unlikely that everyone he ever knew would be aware of his transformation and as a result stop from visiting him. I feel like there's enough evidence to support my hypothesis although of course any sort of literary critique I present has a significant chance of being tainted by my own subjective interpretation of the source material and perhaps I am reaching too much with my hypothesis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bdcemh/is_the_metamorphosis_by_franz_kafka_about/,2019-04-15T05:27:22Z,23,37,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
km325u,My thoughts after reading The Witcher series: A subversion of fantasy (x-post from r/Fantasy),"Over the past month or so I decided to read the Witcher saga from start to finish. prior to this my only exposure to the series was from the Netflix show (which I thought was mostly ok) and a lot of my friends telling me I should play the games (which I plan on doing now that I'm finished with the books.) I came away from the series as a whole with a very different experience than the sum of its parts, and I think there's a lot to talk about. I've tried to mark any spoilers for those who haven't read it but might like to.

**The Short Stories**

Reading the short stories in The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny almost instantly gripped me into the series and world. Each one was framed as a typical fairy tale or fable, but always managed to subvert what we should expect from those kinds of stories (admittedly this was probably more novel in 1993 than 2020). This permeates every aspect of the stories from Geralt himself to the monsters who are often victims more than terrors. 

Geralt is almost modeled on the archetypical ronin or western gunslinger as opposed to a typical fantasy hero. The most obvious way this is shown is the fact that he wanders from town to town picking up odd jobs that serve as a framing device for the story. However a more subtle way this manifests is the fact that Geralt is of a dying breed that is paradoxically both direly needed and seen as in the way by those in power. This is an often overlooked aspect of the Cowboy archetype: the ""wild west"" at the turn of the century was dying, and while they still had a use on the fringes of society, proper civilization with its new social structures were coming and wanted them gone. Witchers in this universe are seen the same way. They are not noble knights, but someone who can be paid money to take care of a problem that others might not even want to acknowledge. It would be very easy for Sapkowski to use this as a way to write a brooding antihero, but he subverts that subversion (which even by then had begun to become cliche) and shows that no matter how much Geralt might want to pretend that all he cares about is killing monsters for coin, he will always care about those around him.

This leads me into a running theme throughout the series, the importance of close relationships and empathy in the face of those who believe that anything/anyone can be justified for the sake of the bigger picture. This is explored a lot more in the novels, but many of the people Geralt encounters in his travel want to use him as a tool to harm innocents or carry out injustices often for no other reason than that they're in the way. Just as Witchers live mostly on the fringes of society, so do many of the monsters and other fantastical races of the world. Because of that, it becomes exceptionally easy to write off harming them or other insignificant individuals as ""for the greater good."" The official Witcher creed is that they should always be neutral and simply carry out monster hunting contracts for money, but it's made abundantly clear by the narrative that neutrality is never really an option. When getting involved in the machinations of people who see people as disposable, the most important thing is to protect the helpless and those you care about, no matter how often Geralt wants to convince himself he's a lone wanderer with no connections to any side. This self-perception vs reality contrast is often highlighted for comedy as Geralt continues to insist he has no friends despite continually picking up a larger and larger group of (wonderful) characters who care about him and he them. It can also be used for drama as Geralt struggles with who he is as a person and whether he is able to have healthy human relationships.


**The Novels**

I had originally planned to only read the short stories because I had heard from various people that they were better than the novels. However the last short story ends on a cliffhanger for the novels themselves so I decided to read at least the first book to see what I thought. The first thing I as a reader noticed was the slower pacing. This makes sense, as writing a 300 page book is very different than writing a 50 page short story, and one could argue that it's actually a 2000 page story given that the 5 novels form one single narrative. I was prepared for that and very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book. It focused on grounded character interactions between Ciri, Geralt, and Geralt's friends. As I said before, the characters in this series are excellent so I was enjoying the ""downtime"" where things could breathe even if not too much important was happening, since that's not something you can really do with short stories. This portion of the book also set up conflicts and characters that would later become important. We later got an excellent chapter exploring the relationship between humans and the non-human races both in times of peace and times of war. However chapter 6 was the first of what I call ""exposition chapters"" of which there are a few in the series. 

These exposition chapters are instances where a lot of fantasy names of people and places are thrown at the reader at once in BoE Chapter 6, the point of view switches from one group of important people sitting around a table talking about important things to another, and I hardly had any idea what anything was. Ironically, when I eventually go back and re-read the series, I'll almost certainly enjoy reading these chapters way more. The people involved and the things happening do end up being really interesting, I just had no way of knowing that at the time so it became very hard not to just kind of gloss over everything. Even a world map would have helped contextualize everything, yet the Witcher series seems to be the one fantasy series in the world that doesn't put one on the first page. The other notable exposition chapter comes two books later in Baptism of Fire when another table of important people are discussing a complex family tree full of names we've almost never heard before. One character even comments that she's confused and the writing sort of implies to the reader ""if you are then that's fine, you just need to know X is the ancestor of Y"", but if you're going to throw a complex explanation as to why this is the case, people will want to follow along. Once again visuals would go a long way in alleviating the flood of made up names to keep track of. There are only a small handful of these chapters, but they stick out a lot to a new reader and can be frustrating.

The next two books, Time of Contempt and Baptism of Fire, are where the plot actually starts and we get to see what the primary conflict of the series will be. I also think this is where some people might be tempted to drop it because at first glance it seems to have adopted a much more conventional fantasy narrative as opposed to the subversiveness that the short stories were known for. That is not to say that they're bad. The big moments are well told and character interactions are still wonderful, but suddenly you've got an evil emperor/wizard, a prophesized princess that needs saving, etc. and everything feels very typical. It's very unfortunate that people feel this way, because this is all intentional. Just as the beginnings of the short stories led the reader to believe that it would be typical fable/fairy tale only to subvert them, the set up here is just like any other fantasy story only to turn everything on its head later.

Sapkowski starts playing with expectations as early as Baptism of Fire, especially with Geralt's ""hanza"" of companions. >!You have a kindly, eccentric hermit that turns out to be a powerful vampire (and one of the best characters in the book.) Then there's the black-masked knight that tried to capture Ciri way back in Sword of Destiny and has been haunting her dreams since then, who in any other fantasy story would be someone Ciri must eventually face an defeat. Except here we learn that the circumstances that led him to trying to capture Ciri were almost entirely out of his control, and he devotes himself to helping Geralt rescue her. There are also smaller moments like Dandelion's ""half century of poetry"" memoirs that are built up for multiple chapters as the culmination of his life's work, only for the book to hard cut to centuries in the future where it's discovered under dirt and then burnt for kindling.!<

Things get very different in the last two books, Tower of the Swallow and Lady of the Lake. Before this point Sapkowski has toyed a bit with non-linear storytelling and multiple points of view, but it kicks into overdrive here. Unfortunately I think this is another point where the series loses some readers who up until this point may have been enjoying the more conventional writing style. The writing definitely starts demanding more from the reader and it can be easy to get lost if you're not paying attention, but I think that the payoff is absolutely worth it. The way points of view from multiple times are used to inform one another is brilliant and when you learn some final piece of a mystery in ""real time"" it hits that much harder. I've seen people complain about perspectives like the trial and the historians, but I personally found them to be a great way to show how others view the protagonists of fantasy stories and how important interpretation is. At times it reminds me of Rashoman.

The way that the series finishes is, in my view, absolutely phenomenal. Everything climaxes in an extremely satisfying way on both the large scale, and more importantly, for our characters. You also realize how much the themes from the short stories carried over to the novels themselves. >!Every faction seemingly wanted to control Ciri ""for the greater good"" (Except Vilgefortz who actually was just evil) and yet we learn that the doom she was prophesized to save the world from was just global climate change that was always going to happen in a few thousand years. Everyone willing to murder to control the chosen one was deluding themselves for personal gain, and she wasn't even the chosen one. Then you have Skellen who aligned himself with corrupt and evil people because he thought the wake of death and destruction he was leaving would be worth it because there was a long shot chance that it could possibly lead to democracy generations down the road.!<  Just as with the short stories, the people who want to control and shape the world as they see fit, even if for supposedly good causes, inevitably become the source of real evil. Not monsters or chaos, but the ones who are supposedly meant to protect. It all ties back to the first short story in The Last Wish.

Then there's the final chapter. >!After everything he's been through, it's tempting for Geralt simply abandon the world and retire. After all, getting involved only results in pain and it would so easy to just decide to do what he always tells himself he will: stop worrying about others and only care for himself. And that's what the plan is, until a riot breaks out in the town where he's staying and innocent people are being attacked. Geralt realizes he can't just let these people be slaughtered. He rushes to their aid and dies in the process. Not from a vicious dragon or evil wizard, but a random guy who got lucky with a pitchfork. It's tragic and yet strangely perfect.!< 

There were parts of the series that at the time felt like they dragged, but once I finished I was extremely happy that I read it. I recommend it to anyone who is willing to read an atypical approach to fantasy writing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/km325u/my_thoughts_after_reading_the_witcher_series_a/,2020-12-29T00:39:20Z,16,93,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
1acnqvn,I finally finished the night circus!,"Initially it catched my attention beacuse the idea of a misterious magical circus that just pops up here and there sounded really exciting, plus the cover was really pretty. 

However, i am sad to say that in many ways it did not delivered, at least to me. At first the set up was interesting, but then not much actually happened. The plot kinda stagnated, the romance of Celia and Marco felt like it came out of nowhere, since they only met a few times, then suddenly they were madly in love. The scene at the bal when they kissed for the first time was great, and i tought we gonna finaly get to the point, but then once again they didnt even met for like a year. 

The biggest appeal of a magic circus would be the mistery behind it, that might get unwrapped gradually. but for the reader there were nothing misterous about it, we knew everything about it from its very begining. Propably this is why i liked Bailey's story line the most, i think a story about an ordinary person who gets swept away with a magic circus beacuse of a prophecy could be a fantastic story. 

The few times something actually happened it was great, wich makes me wish the book was a bit more eventfull. For example the scene where Chandress starts to suspect that something is not okay and sweeps thru Marco's room and finds his magic book, just for Marco to show up, threathen him and erease his memory, was a really tense and cool scene. If you think about it a slightly diferent story like this from the POV of Chandresh could also work. Like he wants to creat an extraordinary circus, but his assistant turns out to be some wizard who highjackes the whole thing for his own shady goals and keeps mindcontrolling people, but maybe Chandres keeps a journal and pieces things together even when he keeps having his memories ereased and tries to somehow fight back. Meanwhile Bailey's equalent gets invited by Pixi to come with the circus, beacuse he is a factor the wizard didnt counted with, wich makes him the one chance thru wich they could free the circus from the wizard. 

Damn now i really want to write this but a few elements would just be too similar.

Anyway, also it really annoyed me how there was no information what the tournament even is, i guess it was to keep us curious, but when it was revealed i only tought ""well thats dumb"". Like what even is the point of this all? This two ancient wizards really have nothing else to do than to train two aprentices until they are more powerfull than Dumbledore, make them have jobs, then wait 20 years until one of them drops dead for some reason. ??? Someone recommended this book to me by saying that it resembles to hunger games beacuse two lovers have to take part in a deadly game, but they are wizards and its in a circus. Wich sounded insane, i cant possibly imagine how could such a fun and exciting premise made to be this dull and boring.

Also it bothered me all the way thru how apparently this world is suppose to be our world, and people doesnt know magic exists, Prospero and the others pretend that their shows are just clever tricks. Except he turned the napkins of the audience into birds, made them fly around, then turned them back into napkins. Why does everyone still pretends that these are just tricks?

The staff of the circus had to know about magic since most of the tents are very clearly magical, plus the entire circus gets transported thru magical means. But we kinda skipped that part, i felt like it would be only natural to see how all these hundreds of people reacted when they found out that magic isnt only very real, but one of their collegues could might as well be a demigod. Thiessen told Celia that he doesnt want to know how her tricks work, but then she fixed his broken clock by just touching it, then changed the color of her scarf, doesnt that counts as revealing her secret? Since its obvioulsy real magic, and how come Thiessen didnt reacted in any way to this insane world view shattering revelation?

The same goes for how everyone in the circus stopped aging, and most of them didnt even cared, like yeah one woman stepped in front of a train and her sister at least started to ask questions, but everyone else treated this phenomenon like its just a slightly concerning rainy weather. How come they didnt all flooded to Celia, the only person they know who does magic.

Also i really dislike how Bailey' story ended. He got connected to the circus, but apparently its a deal that lasts forever? And he only had like five minutes to decide. Even if he wanted to save the circus, it definitely wasnt fair for him, especially since apparently he cant even leave the circus since Marco put that ring into his hand (why even?). What does ""forever"" even mean? Only 3 names got taken out of the immortality book, does this really mean that they all gonna work in the circus forever like its the Flying dutchman with Baily being Davy Jhones?

Not like immortality is a bad thing on its own, many people would love to have it, but the staff still wasnt asked about this all. (Also once again this set up of a circus posessed by two ghosts and run by an immortla staff could also be an awesome book).

Also this just gonna be nitpicking, but what magic users are even doing in this world? Even Celia and Marco have incredible power, shapeshifting, mind controll, healing from any injury instantinously. I cant dare to imagine what their masters might be capable of. And these wizards apparently really doesnt have any effect on the world? Even a single one could take the whole world if they tried, or become the richest man on the planet thru any business if they use magic.

Anyway, thats enough ranting, what are your opinions?

8etnn7,Counting how many books I've read has been detrimental to my development (in the reading world). How about you?,"So I've been keeping track of every book I read over the last three years since 2015. I set myself goals which I often didn't hit. I started reading books simply to add another 'completed' book to my list. I read extensively, but often forced myself to read the rest of a book I disliked simply because 'it's only 50 more pages and then I can add another to my list'. However, this took a lot of joy out of reading itself, and I've now decided to stop.

I'm well on my way to my 2018 goal of 52 (above halfway already), but I no longer wish to keep count. I want to read for enjoyment, and I can't do that if I'm reading it for the goal of ticking it off my list. And since I don't have the ability to disconnect my reading list from the reading experience itself if I keep count, the reading list must go away.

ibffkj,Armor by John Steakley is one of the most emotionally heavy books I have read.,"My father has read well over 2,000 books in his lifetime and he said that this book always sticks out to him. If that isn’t a good enough recommendation, I don’t know what is!

Now that I have finished it, all I want to do is talk about it, but the only person I know that’s read it is my dad and I’d love to get some other opinions. 

##My post will be spoiler free but the comments might not be. 

So over the course of 3 weeks I dove into it, only to be hit by a brick wall of secondhand tragedy. The main character goes through so many emotionally and physically painful experiences, and as a reader, Steakley found a way to make you both witness and experience the moments. I am usually a fast reader, but this book took me a while because I constantly wanted to pick it back up and keep reading, but knew that I was in for an emotionally draining time, and if I was exhausted enough, I would have to put it down. For a bit. 

Steakley has only written two books, Armor being his first, and I think it was surprising to see a unique, but definitely not young style of writing. It sucked me in and was interesting to go back and forth between first and third person whether the part of the book was in Jack’s time or Felix’s. 

Personally, I thought part one was the strongest and most impactful part of the book. That alone would be a killer short story/film. The rest of the book was very good, but the ending just didn’t stick with me as much as I wished/expected it to. The big twist was definitely expected, but not shocking enough to have an impact that lasts further than the pages, unlike some other books, and unlike the other sections of this book!

I could go on but I’d be surprised if anyone made it this far, haha! If you did and have read the book, I’m open to discussion in the comments, if you haven’t read it, I’d be glad to help you find a way to get a copy because it is definitely worth the read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ibffkj/armor_by_john_steakley_is_one_of_the_most/,2020-08-17T14:44:21Z,19,13,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
id7qyu,"[RANT] The proliferations of the ""they said audiobooks aren't real books!!! they're wrong!!!!!"" is annoying.","This might be a meta-rant. I would not know. I have a tenuous understanding of what meta means.

But in reddit, and especially on this subreddit, I read a lot of posts about how ""ugh, people never treat ""audio""-reading as real reading. it really is!!!!!"". I saw one last night on here which I will not be linking because this is in no way an attack or a callout post. It is just tiring to see posts like that, for so many reasons.

The first being... I never tell anyone how I've read a book. How is your mother/friend/co-worker judging you for how you've read a book because, frankly, that discussion rarely, if ever, comes up. I never tell someone I read the book by borrowing it from the library it unless that is part of the plot/the story of be getting the book. Ex: ""So glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't spend money on it!"". I would not tell someone I read a book via audiobook unless it is part of how I enjoyed it, such as: ""I would really recommend listening to it as an audiobook because the reader is GREAT!"". Otherwise, again, I never mention to people that I read the hardcover, British version of the Harry Potter books unless that is part of my recommendation for the book.

Second, and more importantly, I truly think that most of the judgement is only perceived as criticism or judgement, but actually is not. No one is actually judging you for listening to a book. No one cares THAT much about you, and I say that lovingly, because that is a very freeing feeling. No one cares how you've read ""A Gentleman in Moscow"". Why are you listening to anyone who would be rude enough to say ""well that doesn't count as reading"". You read and consumed a book. Screw them. That person who said ""Oh, you listen to audiobooks?!"" is probably just surprised. You thinking about that comment for days and writing a post on Reddit about how people don't respect audiobooks as real reading is overkill, to say the least.

No one is gatekeeping reading, especially not other readers. Story time: I remember feeling self-conscious when I told someone in high school that I ""re-watched"" Grey's Anatomy by reading the transcripts posted online because I wanted a quick recap before a new season but didn't have the patience to sit through the 40+ minute episodes. She was surprised and I felt self-consciousness about what I'd said. But do you know what? She was probably just surprised that someone choose to read a transcript of a show rather than watching it because that is not the 'traditional' method of watching a show. Afterwards, she immediately moved on with her life and truly why would I let that bother me?

This isn't a real rant because, what, I guess I mostly wish people would just have more self confidence and stop letting people real or percieved judgement affect them so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/id7qyu/rant_the_proliferations_of_the_they_said/,2020-08-20T10:23:44Z,24,1,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
5xrht9,The Last Days of Night by Graham Moore,"After completing The Last Days of Night by Graham Moore, I found myself wishing more historical fiction could be this fun. 

The material was well-researched, I wound up learning a few things about the creation of the light bulb, and I enjoyed the patent war aspect. 

I've seen the book receive praise, but it always seems to be followed with derision towards Moore's writing style. That it's too cookie cutter, too simplistic. I personally disagree. 

Wondering everyone else's thoughts on the book, I think it's one of the best I've read in quite some time to be honest! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5xrht9/the_last_days_of_night_by_graham_moore/,2017-03-06T05:15:13Z,0,5,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
5y97ow,"In your opinion, what is the most beautifully written book you've ever read, and which passage would you pick to back up your claim?","I tend to like books based more on how well they are written, as opposed to how compelling the plot is (though a mixture of the two is obviously ideal), and I'm interested in which book, in your opinion, has the most beautiful, poetic, or flowing prose. 

My choice would likely be Gravity's Rainbow. I regularly pick this book up, open it to a random page, and read it in awe. It's perfectly crafted, in my opinion, and each word seems to have been chosen with care. Pynchon is on another level. This is one of my favorite passages from the book, and one of his most touching:


“In the kitchen, the water in the kettle shakes, creaks toward boiling, and outside the wind blows. Somewhere, in another street, a roofslate slides and falls. Roger has taken Jessica’s cold hands in to warm against his breast, feeling them, icy, through his sweater and shirt, folded in against him. Yet she stands apart, trembling. He wants to warm all of her, not just comic extremities, wants beyond reasonable hope. His heart shakes like the boiling kettle. 

   It has begun to reveal itself: how easily she might go. For the first time he understands why this is the same as mortality, and why he will cry when she leaves. He is learning to recognize the times when nothing really holds her but his skinny, 20-pushup arms…. If she leaves, then it ceases to matter how the rockets fall. But the coincidence of maps, girls, and rocketfalls has entered him silently, silent as ice, and Quisling molecules have shifted in latticelike ways to freeze him. If he could be with her more… if it happened when they were together – in another time that might have sounded romantic, but in a culture of death, certain situations are just more hep to the jive than others – but they’re apart so much….

   If the rockets don’t get her there’s still her lieutenant. Damned Beaver/Jeremy is the War, he is every assertion the fucking War has ever made – that we are meant for work and government, for austerity: and these shall take priority over love, dreams, the spirit, the senses and the other second-class trivia that are found among the idle and mindless hours of the day…. Damn them, they are wrong. They are insane. Jeremy will take her like the Angel itself, in his joyless weasel-worded come-along, and Roger will be forgotten, an amusing maniac, but with no place in the rationalized power-ritual that will be the coming peace. She will take her husband’s orders, she will become a domestic bureaucrat, a junior partner, and remember Roger, if at all, as a mistake thank God she didn’t make…. Oh, he feels a raving fit coming on – how the bloody hell can he survive without her? She is the British warm that protects his stooping shoulders, and the wintering sparrow he holds inside his hands. She is his deepest innocence in spaces of bough and hay before wishes were given a separate name to warn that they might not come true, and his lithe Parisian daughter of joy, beneath the eternal mirror, foreswearing perfumes, capeskin to the armpits, all that it too easy, for his impoverishment and more worthy love. 

   You go from dream to dream inside me. You have passage to my last shabby corner, and there, among the debris, you’ve found life. I’m no longer sure which of all the words, images, dreams or ghosts are “yours” and which are “mine.” It’s past sorting out. We’re both someone new now, someone incredible….

   His act of faith. In the street the children are singing:

              Hark, the herald angels sing:
              Mrs. Simmon’s pinched our King…”",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5y97ow/in_your_opinion_what_is_the_most_beautifully/,2017-03-08T17:21:15Z,88,62,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
2iba7f,Reading Anansi Boys and it all read a lot like the hitchhikers guide.,"Heya, this is a small observation and I'm not expecting a large discussion but maybe someone has heard more about this?

I'm was reading Anansi Boys by Gaiman and the writing reminded me so much of Douglas Adams. I kind of liked this, I had read American Gods before and thought Anansi was a welcome lighter version.

But then some jokes, observations, etc, got repeated almost (or entirely) verbatim. 

I wish I'd written it down but I kinda read through it all one night. This could be exacerbated because I've read the hitchhikers guide to someone else last month so it's really fresh in my memory (reading aloud basically grafts it in place..).


Anyone think this before? Is it a deliberate tribute? Is this just a weird bahnhof syndrome thing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2iba7f/reading_anansi_boys_and_it_all_read_a_lot_like/,2014-10-04T22:50:19Z,6,8,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
j03xzh,Under The Dome,"As of today, I finished reading Under The Dome, it took me just shy of 3 months. I thought I might share my thoughts. 

First thing I’ll say is my only criticism I have is the politics. I wish Stephen King would would leave his politics out of the story. He could have quite easily left out Jim Rennie’s political stance and the story wouldn’t be any different. I’m fed up of hearing about politics on social media, hence I read books more often. The last thing I want is to read about politics in a book. 

I’ve heard some people say there was no explanation for the dome. Well, there sort of was...but I guess some people like a fully fleshed out explanation of how and why the dome exists. As much I would’ve liked to know why it was impossible to break and how the device physically got there in the first place, I still think the ambiguity he’s left us with is interesting enough. The idea mentioned of children and ants. It was good enough for me, personally. It was the message he left us with in the last page.

What matters to me is the journey. I’ve heard some say the ending was crap, whether people mean the TV show or the book, I don’t know, but I thought the ending in the book was just beautiful. I don’t ever intend in watching the show. Anyway, I loved the journey so, so much. I loved the characters and had fun imagining the setting. My favourite character....just thinking about it, I don’t really have a favourite character. The group- Barbie, Julia, Rusty, Linda, Jacky, Piper, Ernie, Joe, Benny, Norrie, Claire, Rommie and Sam, these were the people I had the most fun with, especially towards the end. Churches and religion bore me, but Stephen somehow kept me interested in Piper!

Speaking of characters, I’ve never hated a character as much as Jim Rennie. The things he thought of and the things he did, oh the rage was coursing through my veins, I would’ve punched him if I could. Just shows how good Stephen King is at writing characters. And those ‘officers’! He really knows how to make the audience hate people 😂 That reminds me....

Two characters I had a really strong emotional connection with were Sammy Bushey and Ollie Dinsmore. I was so upset when Sammy died! What those officers did to her and when she just gave up, leaving Little Walter! I stopped reading for about a minute to process what just happened after that scene in the hospital. And that connection Ollie had with PrIvate Ames, that was beautiful. I was like ‘don’t die on me Ollie! Don’t you dare!!!’

The first hundreds pages were really good, whizzed right through them...but then the next 200 or so pages bored me. So much so that I only read 1 page a day, sometimes I didn’t read for a whole week. But then I reached page 500, I think, and that was when the book really picked up for me. That was when I started reading a lot. The entire second half of the book was incredible, so incredible that I read 110 pages in one day! That might seem like nothing to those who can read an entire book in a day, but I’m a slow reader. So the book had its ups and downs, but the journey overall was amazing. And because I loved the journey and the themes/messages so much, I’ve decided this is my favourite book of his.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/j03xzh/under_the_dome/,2020-09-26T10:45:58Z,10,9,books,The Last Wish,POST,Fantasy
