uzobo9_1,uzobo9,"Cujo is probably a top 3 Stephen King work for me, I look forward to this.",ZZZrp,2022-05-28T15:57:35Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,1
uzobo9_2,uzobo9,I’m still waiting for the true Cujo follow up about the dogs with bees in their mouths and when they bark they shoot bees at you,SpartanFan2004,2022-05-29T14:36:47Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,2
uzobo9_3,uzobo9,"This prompted me to read Cujo again, since it’s been at least 25 years. Then I realized it’s a Castle Rock story and that I’ve had plans to one day read through those in order. So NOW I’m dusting off The Dead Zone instead, which was also read 25+ years ago.",Capt_Trippz,2022-05-30T17:51:58Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,3
uzobo9_4,uzobo9,I'm in the last stretch of Cujo now and I've had to smoke a huge joint just to get through it. Will they roast to death?! Will another officer come?! Argh. I can't take it.,crystalcarrier,2022-07-18T15:23:04Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,4
uzobo9_5,uzobo9,"Cujo was so boring, it was such a chore to get through. Couldn’t have cared less about the cereal storyline. And I hate the “completely helpless woman” trope; she acted like a horde of zombies had surrounded the car.",be_passersby,2022-05-29T18:04:05Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,5
uzobo9_6,uzobo9,I recently finnished cujo. I thought at the beginning. Pfu a dog getting rabies. This is going to be dull. But damn i was wrong. What a great book,balloon_prototype_14,2022-05-29T09:43:37Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,6
uzobo9_7,uzobo9,I'd have to agree that Cujo and Pet Sematary are way up there on the list and I've only read them once each. They creep me out so much that I don't want to read them again (at least so far). I suppose revisiting them as an audiobook is possible.,richg0404,2022-05-28T19:49:39Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,7
uzobo9_8,uzobo9,"From what it seems, it doesn't have any characters from Cujo, and the book didn't lead into a cliffhanger. Conceptually, it's about the supernatural forces at play, and possibly giving an answer to what really happened to Cujo. 

Even if he didn't remember writing it, he has read it. It's like writing a fanfiction of your own work, which is a funny concept. 

It's also only going to be a novella, so not a full length book. Although, some of his novellas are still pretty beefy.",Maxtrix07,2022-05-28T18:35:23Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,8
uzobo9_9,uzobo9,"She pretty easily could have tricked Cujo into the car and shut it in: open the far side door and get out, reach through and open the near side door, then when Cujo jumps in, shut the doors. If he goes around instead of through, simply get back in and try again from the other side; repeat until the sick dog tires out. Not hard.",be_passersby,2022-05-31T18:18:21Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,9
uzobo9_10,uzobo9,"Cujo becomes a lot less scary if it's something supernatural.

A very large dog with rabies in an isolated spot is scary because it's so plausible.",Dana07620,2022-05-28T19:52:04Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,10
uzobo9_11,uzobo9,"Cujo wasn’t the supernatural part, it was the ghost of Frank Dodd existing in Tad’s closet.

I don’t love the book, but I do love that aspect of the story, especially since (as I recall), there wasn’t really any resolution to it, which creeps me out.

I’m down for a sequel if it focuses on Dodd.",SacrificialSam,2022-05-28T20:47:45Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,11
uzobo9_12,uzobo9,"True. It isn't confirmed what the connection is to Cujo yet. The book is more about the people than the dog, and I have to assume that Rattlesnakes will be the same. Focus on characters, then their confrontations with the rattlesnakes. Yet, there's no way that's the only similarity. 

Maybe it's about the bat that bit Cujo, and where it went afterwards. I know snakes can't get rabies, I'm stretching. But like you, I really do hope that it isn't supernatural.",Maxtrix07,2022-05-28T20:19:15Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,12
uzobo9_13,uzobo9,Dogs with rabies have hyper sensitivity to light. She could have broken off a car mirror and continually shown sunlight directly at Cujo’s face until it left.,be_passersby,2022-05-31T18:35:23Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,13
uzobo9_14,uzobo9,"They’re also very sensitive to loud noises. She could have honked the car horn, beat the hood of her car, etc. to drive Cujo away.",be_passersby,2022-05-31T18:39:31Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,14
uzobo9_15,uzobo9,"She could have at least got her son out and underneath the center of the car. Cujo would have been too big to have reached him and it would have been cooler than inside the car. This wouldn’t have stopped his being dehydrated, but it likely would have kept him from experiencing heat stroke. And she may have been able to make it to the house knowing her son was safely out of the dog’s reach.",be_passersby,2022-05-31T18:52:25Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,15
574n53_1,574n53,This is the one King book I reread the most even though it's so exhausting. In addition to the emotional aspects you mentioned I think the lack of chapter breaks makes it feel that much more demanding. I could be wrong but I think King has stated Cujo is much more of a Bachman book in that in the end the good guys don't really win since Tad days. ,brownspectacledbear,2016-10-12T15:32:31Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,1
574n53_2,574n53,"Love him or hate him (I love him), King is an author who is not afraid to go for the gut shot. Hence the novel Cujo being unafraid to end in such a futile, downer way, as opposed to the movie, which didn't have the guts to piss off audiences like that.

A thing to keep in mind about King is that there are two distinct periods of his career that I call ""Sober King"" and ""Pre-Sober King."" By his own admission, early in his career he was a mad drug addict and alcoholic. Cujo is the novel he says he doesn't even remember writing. This shows in the books he wrote during that time period - off the wall, horrific, wildly imaginative, violent and raw, tripping, full of WTFery, and at times incoherent.

After he sobered up, King became a mellower, more mature writer. He still writes some pretty compelling horror and existential angst, but it's not exploding unfiltered out of his booze-drenched id.

Personally, my favorite King novels are among those he wrote in his coke-fiend days (Cujo, Salem's Lot, It, Firestarter, The Stand, Christine, et al).

I am of course glad that he got clean, and I still love his later works, but they lack a certain... edge to them.",Amadanb,2016-10-12T19:32:06Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,2
574n53_3,574n53,"Oh my god that ending! I literally just finished it and I was just agape the whole time. Like the CPR would work, or they would revive him.

And then the final bit about how Cujo had tried to be a good dog! I wish Cujo had been terrible from the start (that's what I thought was the case before i read it). I just felt so bad for this poor, sick dog the whole way through the book. And then the kid dies. Honestly, so fucking depressing.",Altephor1,2016-10-27T02:03:02Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,3
574n53_4,574n53,"All I can say is that Cujo had a *lot* to do with my childhood obsession with Rabies. Thanks to King (and others), I've spent the majority of my life convinced that I had Rabies.",automator3000,2016-10-12T20:42:54Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,4
574n53_5,574n53,"I can't agree anymore. I was sad Cujo died, even though I knew that was the only ending for him. ",ratherplaydead,2016-10-27T02:06:26Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Cujo,5
