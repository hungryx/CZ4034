aucnjv_1,aucnjv,">If I have one complaint, it's that Lovecraft has the habit of being overly verbose at times, which really kills the pacing of some of these stories and makes them kind of difficult to read.

Yeah, that's a common complaint. I don't mind Lovecraft's prose personally, but it can take some getting used to. Once you do get used to it it really helps to build the creepy, oppressive atmosphere. Lovecraft was the guy who took horro and dragged it into the atomic age, giving it a cosmic, almost sci-fi bent. He seemed to realize that dialogue wasn't his forte, so he opted for large blocks of descriptive prose. 

The first Lovecraft I read was a ""best of"" type of collection, I forget the title, but it had most of his famous stories: The Call of Cthulhu, The Rats in the Walls, The Colour out of Space, The Dunwich Horror, and a bunch of others. There's a large hardcover edition of his works, complete with annotations, that I've seen in the local bookstores.

If you've never read Blatty, do yourself a favor and ready every single word the man wrote, for starters. He is astonishingly good. As good as any other author who ever wrote.

If you've never read The Exorcist, start there. The first thing that is going to surprise you is how funny and full of empathy it is. Absolutely nothing like the movie. Then it becomes chilling and haunting, but never loses it's human touch.

After that, ready the next part of his trilogy of faith, The Ninth Configuration. A work of Christian Apologetics disguised as a theological comedy-mystery. His crowning achievement as an author.

Then read Crazy, a ghost story dripping in nostalgia. Then move onto the final book in the trilogy of faith, Legion, and you'll recognize that this trilogy might just be the best trilogy ever written.

After that, check out Demon's Five, Exorcists Nothing, a satirical look at the making of the Exorcist and Blatty's experiences in the industry.

Then maybe take a side trip and watch A Shot in the Dark, the best of the original Pink Panther movies that Blatty wrote. Incredible.

b6dito_1,b6dito,"I've already got the Necronomicon. Amazing work. 

Not that it makes it bad, but it definitely takes away from the horror. 

For example, the exorcist is actually a crime/ thriller novel. And I was okay with that, I'm fine with books having other agendas but the way it comes across in Rosemary's baby just seems to be utter stupidity. 

I won't spoil it for you if you wish to read it but:
They make it out that she has no say in anything, but she genuinely does, and would notice if she actually paid attention. 

And then the ending is ""she gets some power in her life, but doesn't fully want it"" when if she carried on with her initial decision she would've proved that she's master (mistress?) Of her own life. ",Origin_Pilot,2019-03-28T03:33:29Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Exorcist,1

""It's strange you see it as misogynistic to say it was a female author.""

female authors can be misogynist and sexist as well, imo. 

theo and ellen might as well be 2 boarding school girls fighting over the boy, who's worse than useless. also, I guess i'm just tired of stories where the woman dies at the end because the man chose the other girl. 

in her short stories, Jackson seems to really have her knife out for women who chose career over family. they are portrayed as miserable, pitiful, vile, conniving and in denial about their lives. Her married women are downtrodden or stupid, but I feel there's less malice in those characters than the single ones.


I feel like Jackson didn't see much possibility for women. Her portrayals of little girls (and children in general) are positive and enchanting, but like zero positive adult characters. Maybe she just hated adults in general.

Interesting to read that about Rosemary's Baby. I've always just assumed it's a run of the mill I'm-prego-with-the-devil's baby story. it'll probably go on my list right behind the Exorcist (which I can't really recommend because this'll be the third time I'll be trying to get past the first fifty pages lol).

b6dito_3,b6dito,"I'll number these so I don't get lost in responding.

1. I thought it was implied that Theo was a lesbian? And merely got Luke onto her side just to spite Eleanor. 

2. I haven't read any of her other work, and I doubt I ever will so I can't comment on that. 

Is it that she writes them that way so the story will work? You know like the whole ""if ABC listened to XYZ for 5 seconds none of this would've happened"" kind of thing. 

3. I can recommend the exorcist. As I said in my post, the author said he just wanted to write crime/ thriller novels but ended up with a good horror story. The mother in it, Chris(?) Is annoying as hell. The fact that she has a live in secretary, a cleaner/ cook and a handy man annoys me as she's in the house 90% of the time anyway. And then the company she keeps just so she can be a ""successful actor"". ",Origin_Pilot,2019-03-29T01:43:54Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Exorcist,3
b6dito_4,b6dito,"""I thought it was implied that Theo was a lesbian? And merely got Luke onto her side just to spite Eleanor. ""

hmm, that's an interesting reading of it. it would certainly change my thinking on Jackson if theo were lesbian. I might need to read the book again.

as it is, i'm quite pessimistic about Jackson, and from having read her short stories, I have a difficult time imagining her writing a lesbian character as socially acceptable and physically attractive as Theo lol. Of all that I read by Jackson, Theo's probably the least negative of her female characters.

I liked Theo as the story began. It seemed as though she really cared about Eleanor, trying to bring her out of her shell so to speak. But towards the latter half of the book, it seemed that Theo thought Eleanor was a nuisance, and suddenly seemed to consider her competition for attention. I didn't really understand why the sudden change... Unless it was that Theo never had much feelings for Eleanor to begin with, and was simply nice/warm/friendly to her at first because Theo is an extrovert who's like that with everyone. And when Eleanor got attached to her, Theo became annoyed and tried to throw her off. As much as I disliked Theo at the end, I can certainly understand why she wouldn't want a neurotic like Eleanor to come home with her, lesbian or not lol. 

""Is it that she writes them that way so the story will work?""

do you mean Jackson? i'm not sure why her characters are so vile. it seems to me like she was obsessed with horrible women to the exclusion of all other types of women.

""I can recommend the exorcist.""

Awesome! This gives me motivation to power through. I thought the writing was weird, and was very put off by it. I don't remember how much help Chris had around the house, but I thought she was working on a movie? I don't think I read far enough to know what kind of company she keeps lol.

b6dito_5,b6dito,"As I said, I think it was just bad writing, she needed to further the story to make Eleanor the way she is, and rather than go back to add little subtleties in, she just made the characters do a 180 in terms of their attitude towards her. 

I thought she was a lesbian in the way it's said that she has a ""companion"" at home. It might say friend once or twice but I'm sure it used the word companion more. Maybe Jackson couldn't bring herself to actually say lesbian?

And what you may think as socially acceptable and attractive might be different to Jackson. I can see Theo as that, but also her trying to be something more than what she is, putting on airs as it were, if that's the right saying, and being generally obnoxious/ over the top. 

As for the exorcist, just stick with it. Get past the drag of the first part, and as soon as the plot starts to pick up, it picks up fast into a cascade of events happening. But yeah, the mother is not likeable at all. I won't spoil it, but she's an actress, finishes a movie and then gives up a job to direct a film to look after her kid. But in the entirety of a book, she reads a film script maybe twice. And talks about films maybe three times, there's also an astronaut at a dinner party. Didn't get that bit either.  Sounds like the start of a bad joke. An actor, a politician and an astronaut are talking at a dinner party... 

Edit: the second book to the exorcist, Legion is also decent. More of a crime/ thriller with a hint of horror. ",Origin_Pilot,2019-03-29T21:53:54Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Exorcist,5
