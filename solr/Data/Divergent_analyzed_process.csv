nllbpg_1,nllbpg,You think Divergent is bad.....just wait until you read Allegiant.  If you bother to keep reading them.  Ugg.  I suggest don't.,scrapqueen,2021-05-26T17:27:47Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,1

The Selection is Divergent meets The Bachelor. I swear to God.

Edit: since this is getting some up votes, I'd like to assert that no, not all YA is like this, and there are YA books that I absolutely love (while understanding they target a teen demographic).

nllbpg_3,nllbpg,"I liked the concept and the idea when I first read it. And the subplot of political unrest was kind of well planned. I think Veronica Roth had a good idea but was hasty and sent the first draft off to the publishers.

My main problem with the whole Divergent society is that it's supposed to be a tightly locked down city (Chicago I think), but the supply chain isn't a problem.  As in they have all this technology but where do they source the spare parts and upgrades?
And the ""serum"" they make, where do they get the ingredients and the single use sterile needles they use to inject all this? They need materials that clearly isn't available. There isn't an import economy at all for stuff that they should have run out of generations ago. 

There isn't even a faction of factory workers or mentions of any kind of manufacturing. Stuff just... is available.

Granted there are cars that are specifically said to run on gasoline/petrol and is deemed a luxury. But surely even that runs out or becomes polluted over time?

Also, clothes. They wear new cotton in very distinct colours, but AFAIK, cotton doesn't grow in Chicago! And where do they get the dye?

I get that stuff can be recycled, but it's not specified. It's actually made perfectly obvious that they don't recycle. In Dauntless, they are eating off disposable plates, who made those? In fact Roth makes a very clear point out of mentioning how trash blows in the wind, how abandoned stuff is just spread all over. 
Apart from at the Erudite HQ where everything is spotless. (I mean, who cleans? The Erudite don't thrust Abnegation or the factionless, so who t.f. cleans the Erudite HQ?)

They tried addressing some of the supply-issues in the last book by introducing a ""whoopla"" whole society outside of the closed in zone, but even that makes pretty much no sense as the faction system relies on familiarity, and dumping Tris' mother into it with no context would have been extremely suspicious.

And what's with the fear thing? I'm afraid of a few things, I'll admit. (I'd be an Amity-hippie) but the stuff I'm afraid of doesn't stay the same. It varies with time, from day to day and situation to situation.",FennecsFox,2021-05-26T18:57:00Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,3

nllbpg_7,nllbpg,"I mean, why did the world choose mech suits doing hand to hand combat as their preferred method of attack in Pacific Rim?  And why wouldn't said mech suits use their swords/ other weapons all the time instead of grappling?

Why would a chocolate baron with secret paradigm-shifting technology decide a golden ticket system aimed at kids would be his best chance at choosing a successor?

Why does the entirety of society go along with having no emotions and brutalist architecture in Equilibrium?  Why Gun Kata?

The answer is because.  You accept the out there premise or you don't, but that one leap isn't what makes Divergent (or Pacific Rim/ Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) good or bad. There can still be a decent story in there.

Is there in Divergent?  Is there a compelling arc, interesting characters with complex motivations, a solid plot?  I'd say the answer is a solid ""kinda"".  Out of all the YA novels I read growing up, Divergent was a fun, fast read.  It was one of those 'read it in one go' books for me. And although I haven't read it in years, I'd wager it's still miles better written than RP1.

The author definitely ran into some trouble in the sequels though. That's the thing with an out there premise; you can't get too far into the why behind the world because then things start falling apart fast.",baitnnswitch,2021-05-26T18:50:26Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,7

I very much enjoy stories that take place in  dystopian settings, but it’s important to understand the shallow realism to these societies.

nllbpg_11,nllbpg,"My problem with this book and many others (Especially Hunger Games) is the plot and character development is really shallow and garbage yet they stretch it out over 3 books, even if the concept is interesting, I end up upset partway into book 2.

Eg: hunger games book 1 set the dystopian society and the tone. It was riddled with forshadowing of taking the fight to the capitol. The games were brutal and captivating and I was super ready for book 2 to go head first into rebelling against the capitol. Then turns out, it is just book 1 on repeat. Book 3 was a slog to the finish. Way too much time on self pity overreacting to people trying to help or love her.

I remember divergent was similar in that the concept was captivating and then book 2 and first half of 3 were garbo.

Unasked recommendation. Read some Brandon Sanderson. Good character development and story telling in fantasy worlds where he usually sets his own unique rules for the magic systems. Pretty fun to explore.",typhoid_slayer,2021-05-27T03:39:13Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,11

nllbpg_13,nllbpg,"To me it was worked out in my head like this. 

People dont just have one emotion and the different ""houses"" are not truly about emotion but personality. 

**Dauntless** (the brave) - Brave/Stupid/dedicated to rules. Dauntless are more about upholding the way things are. They are also serving to authority, meaning they take orders and think about little else.

**Amity** (the kind) - These are the people who give more than they take. They are the people who always welcome strangers

**Erudite** (the intelligent) - This one kind of explains itself. They think highly of themselves and their intellect. They feel above the others.

**Abnegation** (the selfless) - Much like Amity, these people are givers. They don't usually care for themselves outside of basic needs but they have a high love of others and the joy that brings them. 

**Candor** (the honest) - People who always tell you what you dont want to hear. They are true talkers.

Understand that these factions dont mean you are only ONE thing. It means that your default mode is this trait. (forgive me i forget character names its been a while) The girl that Tris met in Dauntless showed traits of every house at some point. As did about everyone that you see in the book (and the movie). 

Now, also understand that this is a large society that has acted this way for many years. (i forget how long they say) People don't like change. Each role plays their part fully as they dont want to be considered a stick in the mud and put in the factionless. Check out the other divergent people that were found in the books. Each of them went along with their faction as it would have gotten them hurt or shunned had they not. Our society today is kinda this way actually.

Now, i am not saying that every detail of this was outlined or that the author meant every bit of this. But to me this is what logically came to be. It might not have been fully thought out or fleshed out but it was enough to let me still make since of it all no matter the case.",Wdrussell1,2021-05-26T23:28:56Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,13
nllbpg_14,nllbpg,"YA can seem so shamelessly formulaic and pandering a lot of people look at it and think. ""Damn I could write that"". But it ignores that whatever you want to say about Hunger Games or Harry Potter they actually had some depth. Harry Potter was really in touch with adolescent emotions and shapes the narrative around that, it's why people forgive its glaring flaws. Hunger Games gets mocked for being ""twilight but teen rebellion"" but the books at least had a fairly complicated and well built dystopia and a realistic(ish) commentary on what caused it.

nllbpg_15,nllbpg,"I liked the books, and yes they definitely require a healthy dollop of suspension of disbelief.  However, it can be easy to find yourself surrounded by a society that thinks something, and not really know why.  You can find that the society really holds close at heart some belief, big or small, and sticks to that pretty hard.  And you either roll with it and accept the same belief yourself, or you push against it, and find out how flexible those you are surrounded by really are.    
So sure, as a realistic state of society - Divergent is whacky.  That just makes it clearly fiction and less something to worry about.  So in this hypothetical fictional whacko world - what happens when someone doesn't fit in?  Well that's a neat story.",Ashrack,2021-05-26T20:07:37Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,15

nllbpg_17,nllbpg,"I haven't read the book or the series, but wanted to address some of the things brought up in the OP.

Some series I've read that others like, I don't like.  But typically when I don't like something, it's about very specific things an author did or did not do.  E.g. one science fiction series, I felt the characters were one-dimensional with unrealistic motivation, the science felt like it was being name-dropped to impress the reader as it wasn't actually important to the story, and - well, you get the idea.

But the criticisms brought up by the OP - well, it's not for me to judge others' preferences.  And perhaps the OP couldn't put into words \*why\* they didn't like the story, though I feel the subtext of the OP is Divergent was derivative and unrealistic.  (Is that unfair to say?)  If that's how the OP feels, I feel those could be fair criticisms (though not having read the book I can't really say myself.)

But look at the specific criticisms of the OP, are those specific criticisms really reason to find fault with the book?

Why do humans only have one emotion?  Does there need to be a reason?  Why did Sauron put all his power into the One Ring?  Why is Takhsis the Queen of Dragons?  You could say the latter are fantasy elements, but any fantasy or science fiction is going to have premises that are not normal to everyday life.  That's why they're fantasy and science fiction.  I'm not a fan of Ayn Rand, but she and others do set precedent for works of fiction regarding humanity with altered psyches.

How did the world get to the state it's in?  It's not a bad question, but works of fiction don't necessarily explain themselves.  In medias res is in a lot of fiction, you don't necessarily want to give the reader chapters and chapters of exposition before getting to the ""action"".  (Though there are certainly some that do.)  But do we ask why the world of Harry Potter has magic, or just accept it?

The ""houses"", the ""strong female character doing illegal things"" - all right, so it feels derivative \*and\* it doesn't make sense?  Fair enough.  But -

Suppose you want to have a fictional character identify with and have emotional connections to a group.  A family?  That works out all right in Game of Thrones where family and blood are important to the story, what with royal bloodlines and all.  But if the family isn't directly relevant to the plot, any time spent going into the main character's family is exposition trying to flesh out the main character's personality.  Think about Gryffindor in Harry Potter.  There, the protagonist \*chooses\* the house they want to go in with, the protagonist is fleshed out by the choice made and why, the world is fleshed out by describing the different houses and different ideals.  Or for Superman, Batman, and Spider-man, those are all orphans, whether brought up by an adoptive family, a butler, or relatives, and that fact forms part of the character identity.  So ""houses"", I understand, it feels derivative.  And it is.  But then, just about everything's derivative.  Whether it's Tolkien and the Fellowship of the Ring, the Nine Walkers against the Nine Riders, in a world where there's also the kingdoms of the Elves, the kingdoms of the dwarves - there's always different groups that aren't necessarily directly opposed but that don't share the same interests.

Strong female character, well, the whole ""Mary Sue"" with Star Wars thing, I know.  But ""Mary Sue"" is not about defining female characters, but about any character that has unrealistic skill sets and no character flaws so are really just there to advance the plot.  Is it really an issue that the character is female?  Or strong?  Or a strong female?

As to doing illegal things in a work of fiction, as with the things mentioned so far, it's just another convention.   Whether people are breaking the law because they're young and stupid, or old and scheming, or just an \*\*\*\*\*\*\*, people explore what they are in relation to society and its rules.  Is an ever-increasing wealth gap really what most of the ""people"" want?  You would think not, and yet it happens.  Is criminalization of recreational drugs an effective deterrent?  You would think not, and yet it happens.  (Why is it NOT an effective deterrent?  Because people just don't report usage, then when people don't report usage or problems related to usage, addiction, related criminal activity, and such go up, quite naturally.  I am not saying recreational drug use is a good thing, I'm saying I think long prison sentences are not how the situation should be addressed.  Personal opinion.)  So whatever this world of Divergent is, whatever the OP is mentioning, I don't know - but is it such a bad thing that the character is doing naughty things?  If the laws in that fictional world are just and good and the character is a criminal, maybe that work of fiction isn't meant for you (or for me), but does that mean that work of fiction was ""bad"", any more than documentaries about whatever serial killers (there's a few such documentaries out there) are ""bad""?  It just means it's not for us.  And if the laws are bad or arbitrary and the character challenges those laws, well, again.  You could find exception to \*why\* the character challenges laws (what, one day they just wake up and say ""hey, let's tear down the social order for no particular reason""?  maybe the work of fiction doesn't characterize the reasons for that decision very well?  etc?) but the \*fact\* of challenging those laws would not, I think of itself, be something to necessarily find issue with.

It is unreal about how people tend to ride the coattails of one successful story. Sadly enough, they just copy and paste, make few changes and then have no time to rewrite and expand on it. 

I believe that Veronica Roth had no plan and was just writing this for three weeks. (There is no problem about writing an book in three weeks, but don’t expect it to be good.) This is sad. Cause when book deals are given to people who just debut then they have no chance of making their stories better.

nllbpg_20,nllbpg,"It's so funny to see this as I have a very negative idea of YA lit. I think it's usually literary McDonald's and is read by people who prefer its two toned emotions and The Chosen One narrative - YA novels always seem to be screaming at you, you're special! So special you can save the world and have two crushingly handsome but troubled but gentle boys destroying themselves over you but also be awkward and plain and always a good person.

Harry Potter found me like it did everyone when I was a kid, gawky and shy and excited by everything. So I'll always have to love it. But divergent was the only other YA I read that struck me as having something. Its ridiculous, sure, as a dystopia where everything HAS to be brutal instead of just, you know, logical - the fascists can get what they want without literally killing kids casually. It's emotionally simplistic, everything is Right or Wrong, and the chosen one is just a kid. But it had a kind of rawness and it felt real. I guess vividly feeling like this is actually happening to some kid who could be you helps you forget all the nonsense and tropes.

I haven’t read it since I was 12, so there’s a strong possibility that I thought it was more deep than it actually was, but unlike the books previously mentioned, it doesn’t teach the reader the absurd hyper-individualistic notion that being “special” through essentialist characteristics is not only possible, but necessary to overcome the current paradigm (super powers, prophecies, blood lineage, being “divergent,” etc...).

It’s a really good starting point to start thinking about how much we are sociological dictated rather than believing in the ridiculous ayn-randian notion that “we are not influenced by our surroundings if we are strong enough”.

It’s also a lot more approachable for a 12 year old than 1984, Brave New World, or Fahrenheit 451",hfzelman,2021-05-27T00:37:03Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,41

nllbpg_44,nllbpg,"I think my point is that in the first book, the setting is a premise instead of an actual world, similar to how the first hunger game is more about the story of katniss surviving the publicity game, or how HP1 is mostly ""it gets better in college""... but for kids, and the world is mostly in the backdrop.

Its not until the second books of these series where the world gets really explored, and on that front I do agree the world of divergent is pretty flimsy. In some ways you can see the whole genetic engineering thing all as metacommentary, that these identities aren't REALLY real but instead just a label to justify everyone's actions, but I think thats giving the author too much credit.

But again, as a standalone book, divergent is fine. Tris's story is compelling and relevant, and though vague and outlandish, the settings work as a good device to highlight the story the author wants to tell. Most importantly, the story of Tris is markedly different from HP or Katniss, even if the setting takes bits and bites from them.",10vernothin,2021-05-26T20:09:38Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,44

nllbpg_48,nllbpg,"It's really not good. They are extremely comparable and not particularly original. You got the ""formula"" secret and unfair division of people and the faction sorting school that dates back to HP, the super angsty ""i don't belong in your bucket!"" attitude is shared with Divergent and I'm sure past and future carbon copies. The economy makes only slightly more sense than what is being described for Divergent. And the hacky attempt at future speak is grating, i laughed out loud at the first chapters.

Red Rising papers over all of its problems by making everything life or death and actually killing people so the character carries tragedy with them, but it feels cheap on such a skimpy skeleton.

""YA"" doesn't have to be so cookie cutter or bad. Cory Doctorow and Isabel Allende both have their own series that are much better, a more grounded one and a fantastic one respectively that keep the essentials: a young person trying to navigate the transition to adulthood, angst and all.

181mmgz_2,181mmgz,"I agree it’s not great. But I do recall later books expanding on it.

Basically, the four personalities came up because of deliberate genetic engineering. Humans discovered how to alter genes and went nuts with it. They began programming smart people for academia, brave people for the military, honest people to be politicians… etc.

…And this completely fucked up humanity’s gene pool over time.

And so the setting of the story is actually an elaborate social experiment to try and heal humanity’s genetic health. 

They put a bunch of the different “breeds” of humans together into one city and hoped they would slowly intermingle to produce some well-rounded genetically healthier children over time. 

…But things obviously went wrong.

Naturally, it’s learned later that there are actually a shitton of “Divergents”. The protagonist was not even close to being the only one. But they were all told to keep it secret because of reasons that I don’t remember.

I'm not familiar with Divergent in particular, so I'm not speaking to its defense, specifically.

Critiquing society in their work, however, is something authors often do across genres, but it is not required and not a fundamental part of the work being dystopian. ""Dystopian"" is nothing more than an aspect of the story's setting.",,2023-11-23T10:06:05Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,7
181mmgz_8,181mmgz,"The thing is, the genre of post-*The Hunger Games* dystopia that *Divergent* belongs to— the ""what if LOVE was illegal""/""what if you were sixteen and you had to take a TEST that DECIDED YOUR FUTURE""/etc genre of YA dystopia— are a distinct genre from socially critical dystopias in the classical vein. They don't attempt to make social commentary, for the most part, but what they *do* attempt to do is fascinating. I'd compare them less to *1984* or *The Handmaid's Tale* and more to the horror genre in the way that they take the psychosocial anxieties of everyday life and exaggerate them so that they actually are as threatening as they feel. 

Specifically, YA dystopia of this kind takes the concerns of the imagined everyteen (burgeoning romantic and sexual attractions, specifically of a hetero nature as there are rarely queer MCs in these books; grades/the SATs; peer pressure and parental pressure and growing independence— not that these things are not real concerns for people in that age demographic, but ""imagined everyteen"" is important because the idea that these concerns would be a teenager's biggest concerns is a very straight, white, and upper middle class one) and blow them up to the level of societal issues. The problem is that in seeking to validate the anxieties of the everyteen, it doesn't really do anything else, and the experience of reading them is ultimately kind of selfish. Not that selfish comfort reads are a BAD thing, but I think if you're writing a dystopia, you should aim a little higher. 

*Uglies* by Scott Westerfeld, though it belongs to a different era, is an example of this actually being done well, because the ""everyteen concern"" of enforced conformity to beauty standards is *actually a real problem* outside of teenagers' heads, and provides opportunity for societal critique as well as validation of the anxieties of its target demographic.",vorlon_ship,2023-11-23T17:36:45Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,8

181mmgz_14,181mmgz,"I don't know if you tried reading The Maze Runner, but it was the same thing except it started as The Lord of the Flies. 

The problem with so many of these series arcs was that they started with an implausible world and then said, ""Just kidding! This is *really* how the world works, and it's *bad*!"" Divergent and Maze Runner both started with a premise that we then  learned was a Truman Show experiment and then wrapped a shallow ""bad guvmint"" around that.

The Hunger Games never did that. They showed you what was really going on behind the curtains, but not in a way that insulted the reader or their intelligence. It was a (somewhat) plausible part of the way the world was built, in a way that we could appreciate from the premise. 

Then there are the stakes. Why is any of this important? What does overthrowing the big-bads accomplish? Most of this genre simply assumed that readers would think it was important because overthrowing or subverting the evil regime is always important. That we could just assume it was all that was needed to make the world A Better Place. The Hunger Games actually addresses the question, rather than just giving it a pass.

Then we have the characters. Tris was supposedly ""different,"" but we couldn't really see how (other than from the tests) because Veronica Roth couldn't plausibly describe truly one-dimensional characters. Everyone was written as the same character but with a few stereotyped characteristics. 

In most of these series, the biggest issue is that the events never change their characters. Everyone is who they are, and they just move through the world-shaking events of their stories like it's an average week at high school. The Hunger Games does better here than most, too.

They took all the ingredients for a dystopia, but didnt make them blend at all, and didnt have an underlying critiquing theme that a Dystopia needs (what ruined society and how did they try to fix it?)

The author took a head of lettuce, a whole tomato, a whole onion, threw them in a bowl as-is and called it a salad, hoping it would sell.""",butterfliesandbrooms,2021-05-05T13:21:14Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,2
n4uiik_3,n4uiik,"I think the problem is that almost everyone mentions The Hunger Games and Divergent in the same sentence. They were both popular YA book series with movie adaptations in the 2010s but apart from that they only show little similarities. And I am sure that at least 90% of people prefer The Hunger Games to Divergent. So when you always read Divergent in comparison to The Hunger Games you are probably prone to be disappointed.

As you have already mentioned, Divergent is lacking the ""stereotypical dystopic enemy"". The bigger picture actually gets introduced in the third book.

As a teen I really loved the series. However, as a teenager you are more interested in the relationships between the characters while a critical adult reader always looks for clues about what the novel will tell us about contemporary society.

The first book was definitely my favourite as a teenager so I do not know if that may change if I reread the books anytime soon - so I do not know if you will warm up to the books if you struggled with the first one.",JuHe21,2021-05-04T20:36:17Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,3

n4uiik_11,n4uiik,"I think the simplest way of stating it is that the author didn't exactly think things through. To address the character part of it, I didn't have a ginormous problem with it. The author didn't do anything outstanding, but... there were bigger issues. I guess I would just say that many authors these days either focus on the characters, or they focus on the plot and these ""cool new ideas"".

I didn't get the point of the factions system either, and the 2nd and 3rd books (which were both DNF for me) didn't really clear things up that much. From what I can tell, Divergent mashed the districts from the Hunger Games and the houses from Harry Potter together into... some lopsided mess (and as far as I could tell, Candor did basically nothing for most of the trilogy, which is pathetic).

In terms of the ""sacrificing quality for simplicity"" issue, it's hard to say. A lot of YA written around that time was aimed at selling as many copies as possible. Maybe it's just me, but I felt like its cousins in that genre (The Hunger Games, Twilight, Throne of Glass -- sorry, these are the only ones I've read) didn't have super impressive writing/characters/ideas either.",,2021-05-06T07:58:01Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,11

If the ultimate outcome was divergent, why would you want to so strictly separate them by trait instead of freely mingling with the other groups?

And it clearly wasn't run very well to begin with. The only reason they got Triss in the first place was because her mother, from *outside* the city, got moved in on some pretext. Any serious experiment would be considered tainted at that point, but all it ended up doing was proving that the city was dumb from the start, because the genes they apparently needed were from outside.",Geobits,2021-05-05T15:05:08Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,18

Not everyone is looking for something complex. Some people are looking for lighter fare. There is an audience for that. That is the intended audience of books like *Divergent*.

The math problems look imposing and starting on her economics paper holds no appeal so she turns to a book on her English extra credit list, *Divergent*. Reading about a girl who lives in a city, safely jumps off moving trains and zip-lines off skyscrapers is the escape she needs. She likes a hero that doesn't fit into any of the usual categories.

I just wanted to say that I absolutely loved Divergent as a kid! I remember others in my class reading it too and we'd discuss about what factions we'd fit in and everything. I even remember making a movie trailer about Divergent with my friends for a school project! Good memories :)

Anyways...

What is (one of) your favorite books or series?

Do you have any tips for beginner writers?

Also, I'm sure you come up with lots of ideas when you go about your day, but how did/do you decide which ones to develop and work on? And how did you decide which ones had potential? I love writing and I've attempted projects when I was younger, but right now (I'm in uni, unrelated major) I haven't found much inspiration to start a project seriously. I do have some random ideas but honestly they just seem meh for some reason...

On another note, since you frequent on Reddit, do you ever go on r/WritingPrompts? It's one of my favorite subreddits. So far, I've mostly just spent my time responding on there to practice my writing skills without needing to come up with a completely new idea (since I seem to be lacking creativity at the moment :/)

fx7ysn_82,fx7ysn,"I haven't read any of your books, but I have seen one or two of the Divergent series of films. So I wonder how closely the films reflect the books?

I liked the films; I'm not asking you to criticise them, but is there more explanation and exploration of the world and the characters in the books?

I can't say I understood entirely from the films, or at least I don't remember - what brought about this dystopia, or how they settled on a society divided by virtues.

I got a strong Aldous Huxely vibe; it's a Brave New World of sorts, except division into factions on the basis of intellectual ability makes a practical kind of sense, and people do exhibit levels of intelligence. But to my mind; and not having read the books, morality is fundamentally a sense, like the aesthetic sense - and so I wonder, if in the books, it's a dystopia because what you're saying is that individuals cannot be described in terms of singular moral characteristics or socially constructed virtues?

Beatrice is clearly the John Savage figure, who throws everything into stark relief, only she doesn't come from outside. She's Divergent! What I don't get is - surely everyone's divergent, because no-one would fit into such categories.",,2020-04-08T21:06:46Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,82

When I'm drafting a new book or story, I get up and eat breakfast and try to write for a couple hours, and then the rest of the day I start and stop-- stop to eat lunch, try to start again, stop to go to the damn chiropractor, try to start again, walk the dog, start again, etc. When it's a tough day, I give myself a break. When it's an easy day, I try not to stop as much.

I'm not sure if it's changed because I've had more success-- my adult life was ushered in by Divergent, so I never got to see what my routine would be like without it. I am happiest when I'm writing, specifically revising, and have the freedom to do the routine I described earlier. But sometimes I am in Publicity Mode and I'm traveling, or I just need to have a fallow period where I let things cook, and I don't try to force it during those times.

fx7ysn_100,fx7ysn,"I don't think of myself as a ""chosen one,"" but I did draw on some of my experiences while writing. There are five chosen ones in the book, and each of them relates to their fame in a particular way-- Sloane, the main character, resents it and just wants to be left alone, Matt feels a sense of responsibility, like he has to do good with it, Esther has embraced it and started a lifestyle brand, Albie is troubled by it. I have felt all of those things at one point or another, though obviously being ""writer famous"" is a little different from being actually famous. I was twenty-two when Divergent came out, and scared as hell, even though what was happening was really positive for my career and has been wonderful for my life in general. I mean, I have an anxiety disorder, so you can imagine why a lot of eyes on me was a little overwhelming.

Chosen Ones also opens with a celebrity profile of Sloane that objectifies her-- I did a lot of research for that, because there have been several celebrity profiles in mainstream publications that objectify and sexualize their subjects. But, while I was never sexualized as a young author, the way I was discussed was often troubling to me. One in particular-- I spent days with this guy, I was vulnerable and open with him, I was thoughtful about my career and success, and in the piece itself, he described me physically in a way that's still really weird to me, and he barely quoted me. He quoted people talking about me-- but even then, not about me, but about the phenomenon of Divergent, as if I had nothing to do with it. I thought of that while writing the piece about Sloane, and I finally let myself feel anger about it. I never wanted to be angry about it before, you know-- because it's a huge deal for an author to get a profile written of them in a major publication! I felt like I had to just be grateful and shut up. I don't feel that way now.",vrothbooks,2020-04-08T16:17:05Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,100
fx7ysn_101,fx7ysn,"The quick and dirty version: I wrote a manuscript that was not Divergent, and I sent out query letters to 35 literary agents. (If you want to be published by one of the Big Six publishers, you need representation-- I think getting representation is super important in general, but that's the main reason why I went that route.) I got flat rejections from 34 of those agents, and 1 was a rejection-- but with really helpful notes. She (Jo) said she liked my writing, if not my story, and that I should send her what I did next. While I was raking in these rejections (this happened over a period of like six months), I started something new. That project was Divergent. When I finished it, I got a bunch of readers, polished it up, and sent it out to 8 agents. I got an offer from one, and she told me it was ready to go on submission-- and then I got an offer from Jo, with nine single-spaced pages of notes to address before we went out on submission.

I knew the book wasn't ready. I hadn't figured out why, exactly, but Jo's notes were amazing. I trusted her judgment-- so I signed with her. I revised a lot. A few months later, the book went out on sub. Four days later, we got an offer from HarperCollins. It was wild.

It feels different now because I've experienced a lot-- and I also have a lot more power now, thanks to having such success early in my career. I'm now involved in the business side much more than I was before, which makes everything feel different...less magical, maybe, but more practical. And with Chosen Ones-- it's a special book for me. It feels like a leap forward in my creative growth. So while I'm not as EXCITED as I was with my first book coming out, I feel more proud and less nervous. Could also be the years of therapy?

Years later as an adult, I found a Xanth book I hadn't read, because of course he was making new ones while I wasn't paying attention anymore, and I was stoked. I remember thinking how great the books were and how I couldn't wait to get lost in Xanth again like when I was younger. I got about two chapters in before I had to put it down. There was nothing wrong with it, it was just as good as any of the others, but it was suddenly SUPER obvious that they were aimed at kids/YA.

Even as a teenager (especially as a teenager) the books “meant for teens” made me feel brain damaged while reading them. 

Comparing Divergent to stories like Ender’s Game or Spell for Chameleon or Dead Zone is silly. 

Accessibility isn’t a “special treatment” it is just constructed to include more people. YA tends to pander and bait younger kids into thinking they’re reading teenage things, ie, they’re actually written for 4-6th graders, pre-teens.

nc8wfc_12,nc8wfc,"Yes and no.

Targetting kids is not an excuse for being shit. Not an excuse for movies, shows, games, or books.

There are countless examples of creative books, shows and movies aimed at kids or teens that are well done, engaging, and consistent.

You don't get a free pass on plotholes, one dimensional characters, poor pacing, etc. because your target audience is ""whoever can't see this is bad""

Yes, there are topics that are meant for children, you shouldn't expect to fall in love with the premise ""10 year olds run the world for a day"" or something along those lines, or something edgy meant for teens like ""this one quirky, very special, one of a kind person doesn't fit into their oppressive society"" thats fine. If you aren't hooked by those that is ok, just doesn't appeal to you. But you can still spot good and bad writing. 

I hadn't heard people speak badly about Artemis Fowl, well about the movie perhaps, and I am not familiar with Eragon. But, divergent is a pretty silly and flawed story. It is not wrong to call it bad regardless of whether you fit the tatget demographic or not.

I think more important to remember is that you are allowed to like, even love, bad media.

For example twilight and 50 shades are pretty much universally hated and memed on by the internet. And yet, a lot of people still like them, love them even.

I didn't put myself through the books but my girlfriend likes 50 shaded and we watched the movie. Not a very good movie, but we still had fun.
I also have guilty pleasures. The DC shows forb example. The flash makes no sense, is extremely poorly paced with stupid one dimensional characters and nonsense pseudoscience that has no level of consistency. Still watched it all because the drama is serviceable and the high points are very fun to see.
I would not call it a good show, but I still love it.

We can agree that something is not that good and still love it above things that you know is better.

So you love a bad book, or loved it when you didn't know better... so what? 
We can still call out bad content that is clearly only aimed at children or teens becsuse it is bad, without ever judging the readers that liked it.",GsTSaien,2021-05-14T17:05:20Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,12

nc8wfc_25,nc8wfc,"There are so many YA series, and I think it's okay to acknowledge that we're massively oversaturated with formulaic dystopian YA fiction without just taking the cop-out that we're not the intended audience.

I'm a 34 year old dad, and I still cherish *His Dark Materials*, Earthsea, the Tiffany Aching Discworld series, *Sabriel*, *A Wrinkle in Time*, *The Dark Is Rising*, *The Outsiders*, pretty much everything Daniel Pinkwater did...

And I do differentiate between books that aren't for me and books that I genuinely don't think are good. I didn't like *13 Reasons Why* but I don't think it was formulaic or a bad book; it just wasn't a book I loved (totally unrelated, to head off this conversation: I don't couple my evaluation of the book to the Netflix series, which I think was breathtakingly irresponsible). I don't think after establishing that it's unfair of me to say that I really think the *Divergent* series is just *not good*. It's a considered opinion and I make it with full awareness that I'm not the target market.

EDIT: one thing I noticed as I was thinking about this list was that shoehorning in a love triangle is a *fast* way to make me lose interest. They always feel forced in YA to meet market needs, and they're so overdone at this point. Romance has to be earned and the worst of YA lit doesn't earn it, instead forcing glorified puppy love into the center of the story, often with some fucked up age dynamics...",troglodyte,2021-05-14T19:27:35Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,25

Divergent wasn’t a bad book series. It was even somewhat enjoyable while reading. But honestly, after reading it I kinda never wanted to read another YA dystopian story again. Never *needed* to read another one. Not because it was extraordinary. But because it was so... Man I don’t have words to describe what I’m trying to say lol.

It kinda just killed the genre.

7p4khi_1,7p4khi,"My favorite review of Divergent, courtesy of Alex Falcone on Amazon.

>If you liked Hunger Games but thought it needed more rules, you're going to love Divergent!

>The debut novel from Veronica Roth, Divergent imagines a future after a great war. The only way to restore peace is to divide humanity up into 5 Death Frats named after SAT words. People join them by having only one personality trait: brave people join Dauntless where they jump off trains and punch each other. Smart people join Erudite where they wear glasses. Amish people join Abnegation where they don't eat hamburgers. And the other two are both Hufflepuff.

>In the EXTREMELY RARE situation where somebody has two personality traits (""I have glasses AND don't eat hamburgers!"" -or- ""I play baseball AND football"") they are ""divergent"" (a Latin word meaning ""too cool for school"").

>""But wait,"" you say. ""How do they figure out which frat to join?"" I'm glad you asked. Pledge week in Dystopian Chicago consists of a hallucination where you have to choose between a knife and cheese with no other instructions. Then a dog attacks you. If you choose the knife, you are Dauntless. If you choose the cheese, you're not. Isn't that cool? That's all it takes.

Trix is one-dimensional, and so is every other character. And while you could argue that The Hunger Games doesn't win any awards for character development/building, they are unique and fleshed out. Katniss isn't a blank slate, we know what she looks like, what her interests are, why she is motivated to do what she does. The rest of the characters are good too. Trix, whatever her boyfriend's name is, I can't remember anything unique about them except that Trix excels and everything and is the most special person in her world for having more than one personality trait.

Just like any genre, the are authors who are better at it than others. Plenty of stories follow a Hero’s Journey. And among these books, some are definitely better than the rest even if they follow the same story structure. It’s not confusing or inconsistent to criticize the poorer versions while praising the better ones.

 Prose isn’t everything (I’d say it’s merely not one of Sanderson’s strengths rather than a weakness) and some people actually to like that type of prose.

But six of crows gets a lot of praise by the cynics in r/fantasy. People critique the fact the characters are too young for the story, but it’s generally well enjoyed. Skyward is YA, but it reads more mature that a lot. There isn’t the love triangle or the love story that YA usually has. Mistborn is adult (I’ve heard that in europe, it is marketed as YA so regional dependent). That could be a big factor. Sanderson’s other YA works tend to not be looked at too fondly, whereas as Mistborn and skyward are just quality works. There’s other YA books that get a lot of praise as well. His dark materials gets constantly put on Top 100 book lists. Some people will hate on all YA, just because it’s YA. But I’ve noticed more often that not, it’s usually commenting the fact the same tropes get used over and over or the writing isn’t that great. But people do the same thing for romances, mystery thrillers, etc. I like YA because we get more diverse stories of queer people and POC’s, even if sometimes it’s filled with YA tropes and could’ve had another edit.",jenh6,2021-06-22T19:25:47Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,3

o5mubw_6,o5mubw,"Mistborn is pretty much considered YA on the r/fantasy subreddit at least. I usually hear it classified as YA. 

People look down on YA because they think it makes them look more intelligent. Divergent and Grishaverse were hugely popular and successful YA series so naturally people must go out of their way to hate on them because they 

A. Were super popular for a time 

B. Were YA 

And in many cases there's a lot of misogyny involved in the hate of YA. Female authors are often placed into a YA category even if it wasn't how they intended their book to be written. And female authors tend to dominate the YA genre. The perception that YA is girly definitely plays into some people's unnecessary hate and condemnation of the genre. 

That Mistborn isn't considered YA probably had a lot to do with the fact that Brandon Sanderson is a man and therefore is given more legitimacy behind his work and not because his books avoided tropes and features characteristic to YA. 

There is also a perception that direct prose is indicative of bad writing. YA books are not designed to be written poorly, they are designed to be written directly and sometimes more literally than adult novels.

Sanderson has the mediocre writing and minimal character development down down but he's fantastic at writing worlds and hard magic systems. His magic is the fantasy equivalent of hard SF, and his plots are good. His worldbuilding isn't up there with a Bakker or a Tolkien or an Erikson, but it's still top  flight.

1l6oxu_1,1l6oxu,"So, I LOVED Hunger Games and Gemma Doyle both. I think what you're getting at is that people are grouping together a whole bunch of different types of books under the YA category. Which is, ultimately, not a terrible thing, you just have to be able to read between the lines about them.

The difference between Hunger Games and Twilight/Mortal Instruments is the role that romance/sex plays into them. With Hunger Games, the love triangle is a plot point. With Mortal Instruments, the love thing (I don't remember what the situation was exactly- kind of lost interest) is central. The story becomes very weak without it. This second type are essentially a repackaging of romance novels for a younger generation. Repackaged to included vampires or whatever because that's what's ""in"" right now- True Blood style world with whole bunches of creatures. These ones also tend to be written more like fanfiction and only count as page turners because there's nothing challenging in the entire thing.

You want more adventure books. (Me too)

Divergent was really good. Not 100% out of the fanfic style, but still there's enough there that you can really escape into them.

My recommendations:

- Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs: the second book in this series is coming out soon. It's a fascinating setup and the movie (rumor says) is in the works and I thiiiiiink Tim Burton is directing (90% sure. will regoogle and check in a minute). I'm about to re-reread it.

- The Maze Runner Series by James Dashner: Incredible. Confusing. Challenging (subject matter-wise) Has elements of Lord of the Flies and Hunger Games and Enders Game. Plus now a prequel! (read that last)

- Partials by Dan Wells: There are 2 books in this series out. It's a dystopian future and, while in parts it dragged a bit for me, It's a pretty fascinating scenario. Not the omg bestever, but still something I'd reread.

- The Bloody Jack Series: these are a little bit younger, but they're all adventure and page-turning for the right reasons. These were a side-along obsession when I was really into the Gemma Doyle series, so they might be worth a glance. (plus there's kind of a lot of them now- going to have to grab some of the new ones!)

- Graceling by Kristin Cashore: These are a little more on the fantasy side. There are overtones of Game of Thrones, but they really create a world that I want to know more about. They also really deal with some difficult issues, especially in Bitterblue. (there may be triggers for people healing from abuse of any kind- be careful. it's dealt with well, but could still be a risk.)There are 3 books set in this world now and, from the endings, there are definitely more to come.

Also Game of Thrones. Not technically YA, but still. Just do it.",greenerskyahead,2013-08-27T18:07:19Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,1

1l6oxu_3,1l6oxu,"I do think you're looking at it from the wrong perspective. YA is not a genre. It's an age classification. Also even within genres you have good and bad books which are mainly based on personal preferences. YA protaganists are generally less mature and moody and where that annoys some readers while others relate to it. And again there are a number of protaganists who are none of that.

I haven't read Mortal Instruments (and don't plan to) but I have read Divergent and I'm not a huge fan, but honestly it's the world building that annoys me most. And in the sequel Insurgent, the author chose not to add in any recap. It had been a while since I read Divergent and I spent most of the book trying to remember what happened.

That all being said my favorite YA include [Speechless](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13069681-speechless), [Dealing with Dragons](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150739.Dealing_with_Dragons), [Tamora Pierce's books](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8596.Tamora_Pierce), [Ender's Game](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game), [Ella Enchanted](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24337.Ella_Enchanted), [If I Stay](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6564365-if-i-stay), [Unwind](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/764347.Unwind), [Eon](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2986865-eon), and [Angelfall](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11500217-angelfall)",celeschere13,2013-08-28T18:34:07Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,3

I think I preferred Enclave more than Divergent.

I loved Kenneth Oppel's Airborn series (steampunk) but it skews a bit younger than HG.   I also liked the Septimus Heap books - again they skew younger than HG.  

I love Hugh Howey's Molly Fyde series - space opera books.  And of course Ender's Game. 

The Lorien books from Pittacus Lor are very entertaining.

Of course none of these qualify as ""literature"", but they're well written and fun to read.

1l6oxu_7,1l6oxu,"Twenty-three year old male and I've read both, I'm slightly ashamed to say. I tried to stop reading YA when I turned 20..fought the good fight for about two months before giving in. I think what makes it easier for me than you is that I don't take them too seriously - when I need to defragment I like to sink into the simpler, adventurous stories and the worlds they create. Still, it's even better to find *good* Young Adult fiction. Oh man..

Divergent is alright, Mortal Instruments is *alright* (to my credit, I read those when I was actually still a teenager). I recommend the old-school young adult fiction if you're looking for something worth reading. *Shade's Children* by Card is great, and *The Last Book in the Universe* by Philbrick is one of my all time favorites. Curiously enough, they're one-shot (non-series) books. Can't help but think there is often a correlation between quality and series length..but regardless, happy reading.

35eoy8_1,35eoy8,"It's a young adult novel, and as the trend has been going, these very weak novels that are highly accessible due to a lack of depth and difficulty, will continue to wreak havoc. I read Twilight, and to be honest, Stephanie Meyer still wrote a strong book, despite what people will generally say. However, I think Divergent and the Hunger Games are very weak and vague, lacking general storytelling and world building, and also having weak character development. But, they are highly accessible so they can be gobbled up by those that find reading a difficult activity or by those that need quick entertainment fixes. They are also set in believable worlds, so that makes a person who usually finds fantasy or sci-fi too jarring to be a little more comfortable. 

That said, the Hunger Games movies add an element to the story because they are imaginative and descriptive of the world. Collins just doesn't deliver a world. If she did, the movies would be weaker in comparison. As it stands, the books suck.

9cwgyk_1,9cwgyk,"Hmmm I'm sure the inconsistency can be chalked up to Tris mishearing and really doesn't matter in the long run, and a big part of the plot of Divergent was Four teaching Tris how to manipulate/discipline their minds so that her divergent behavior doesn't show up in the fear landscape, and Tris being from Abnegation (God these words) was taught young to hide or at least divert her emotions.

Plus, the fear landscape is kinda abstract in its construction, fear of Divergence could be deconstructed as a sum of fears of individual punishments.

I think the bigger question is that the book has shown that everyone has multiple ""faction"" traits (lots of the dauntless are smart/cunning, loyal, selfless, hardworking etc) to the point that Divergence is pretty much a label, so why persecute divergence? It only makes sense if the book is commenting on scapegoating, but even then what made Tris divergent in the first place?",10vernothin,2018-09-04T15:56:22Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,1

'Few people who are born into Abnegation choose to leave it. When they do, we remember. Two years ago, Marcus's son, Tobias, left us for the Dauntless, and Marcus was devastated.

As for Divergents being hunted, it's as the book explains toward the end. The factions lost touch with what they claim as virtues and turned them into rules so as to control the members. But Erudite obviously took it way too far, and realised Divergents cannot be controlled and so they pose a threat to the bigger picture. They are the only ones truly capable of defying the norm and therefore rebelling against it. 

Remember at the start, most people don't know that divergents exist. So it isn't really a label. 

As for what makes her divergent... I haven't read book 3 as I said so I can't say for sure. But since most divergents are born in Abnegation it's my guess that the ""selfish"" ones really don't fit in at all and that's what wakes them up for lack of a better term. Like, the other factions don't try to seperate themselves from their ego. Abnegation does. So this self-awareness in Abnegation could be what triggers it.

It's not horrible - but it's no HG.  A book in the same genre that I actually liked more was Enclave by Ann Aguirre. ",onerandomday,2013-08-31T12:54:15Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,2

Divergent just tries to many things at once, some ideas are bad (e.g. jumping on moving trains), it isn't focused and keeps jumping from one point to another every three pages or so, and it's key central point of dividing a population based on their characteristics sound nice in general but really isn't (that in its self spawns some sort of personality racism).

1lfuf7_4,1lfuf7,"I hated Divergent, loved the Hunger Games, and do not feel they should be compared.

Hunger Games is awesome, because Suzanne Collins builds a world, then uses it as a tool to make a point. Comparing Veronica Roth to Collins bastardizes everything Collins does right.

Veronica Roth creates this awesome world with amazing potential. But she forgoes doing anything with it to shove a pointless, cliched romance into the center of the plot. 

The writing and structure are amateurish at best, and the characters are expected, flat and awkward. Yes, it is mildly entertaining, and written about as well as 90% of the other YA books out there right now,  (which is not saying very much) but it's extremely overrated.

If you want something light and easy to flip through over a weekend, read it. You'll be able to talk about it with other people, the third book hits in a few weeks, and the movie's coming out next spring. Just don't expect it to blow your mind or make you any smarter. It's passable for what it is, but it's not being advertised from the best angle. Go in with low expectations, think of it as nothing more than a silly teen romance, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",obsolete16,2013-08-31T07:11:41Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,4

The world was interesting but didn't make a lot of sense (I'm still trying to wrap my head around how many people there are in each faction).](/spoiler)",sophie106,2014-03-16T01:33:06Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,3

20hws7_5,20hws7,"Veronica Roth built such an interesting world in Divergent. She wrote it so beautifully, as you said, but especially for a science fiction book. If she rewrote the second and third books using the same world and following Divergent, I'm sure it would be a great trilogy. 

I'm not a huge fan of the cast. The effects, setting, and expressions of the actors all look forced in the trailer, but I'm waiting for the actual movie to prove me wrong. ",stilalol,2014-03-15T21:56:30Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,5
20hws7_6,20hws7,"I completely agree. If they were all written in the same sense as Divergent, it would have been a mind blowing set.
Also, I agree the film looks forced. The trailers just don't look as fluid and natural (as natural as acting can be, anyway) as I would like them to. I know a good movie much the same as I know a good book: it draws me in without me having to really try, and I subconsciously begin to believe it's real on some level.
I'll be horrified if the movie ruins the book.. We don't need another Twilight fiasco.
Edit: Sorry to those of you who loved the Twilight movies.. I just feel the first ones were a little forced and almost made fun of the books. Although I do think they got better towards the end - the last one being the best. I still love the books.",dysfunctionaldarling,2014-03-15T23:44:42Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,6
1si7n7_1,1si7n7,I think the sequels are worse :( I liked 'Divergent' even though I'll admit it's flawed. But the next two books....augh. I'm reading them because I want to know how it ends but they are pretty bad. ,Inukiii,2013-12-10T01:12:58Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,1
2prd3h_1,2prd3h,"I wouldn't recommend it. I feel like Roth took the easy way out with the ending, and there were many unresolved plot lines that kept snowballing throughout the series. The duo point of view wasn't executed very well either, and I was genuinely disappointed because I loved Divergent and although Insurgent wasn't as good as the first one, the revealing of the social experiment was interesting. 

If you're going for a dystopian theme, I recommend **Ready Player One** or the **Unwind Dystology**. All the best for your future lessons! ",hopstepjump_,2014-12-19T06:54:30Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,1
2prd3h_2,2prd3h,"I read the Divergent series. I thought the first book was pretty good, the second OK, but honestly I don't think I even finished Allegiant (and I was excited to pick it up after putting it on hold at my library and waiting several weeks).

I just completely lost interest in it. Even though these were characters I originally was interested in.

So the short answer is no, I wouldn't recommend it. But out of curiosity, what kind of students do you have? Have they read the first two books? It seems a little odd to me to assign reading the third book without the context of the first two. 

Just one reader's impression. ",GinaZaneburritos,2014-12-19T05:22:16Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,2

I thought of doing the same with Divergent, but I don't know that there is any value to it after the first book. I think I'd rather do Divergent,then The Giver, and maybe a classic like 1984, to stay within the theme. ",MiddleKid,2014-12-19T05:26:46Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,3
2prd3h_4,2prd3h,"Thanks. Sorry I didn't read your post very carefully, or I would have seen you had no intention of assigning Allegiant on its own.

I think Divergent, The Giver, and another book sounds good. Or maybe you could do Hunger Games again if it worked so well? They're still quite popular.",GinaZaneburritos,2014-12-19T06:22:38Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,4
2sdqd3_1,2sdqd3,I don't remember many flaws in Divergent itself. The series ending really let me down. But I'm hoping that you knew that before starting to read. ,jesn08,2015-01-14T08:55:13Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,1
2sdqd3_2,2sdqd3,"I had trouble with the idea that so many humans could fall for such a structured society that clearly should not work.  The real problem, here, is that only people who are mentally ill would NOT be divergent.  Every healthy person has empathy for others, has bravery, has intellect, to varying degrees.

In my mind, I was waiting for the ""factualness"" to rise up and take over.",deck_hand,2015-01-14T13:53:14Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,2

Agree. That said, I enjoyed reading *Divergent* and even went on to binge-read the trilogy, but did find myself thinking the whole time 'this is pretty derivative'. More of a 3/5 star trilogy for me. 

OP, you'll find the other two books good if you liked book one :)",kmcg2375,2015-01-14T18:13:49Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,3
hi7ec_1,hi7ec,"I liked *Divergent*, and I think it's the first book I've read targeted ""for fans of *Hunger Games*"" that I think actually will appeal to many fans of *Hunger Games*. Very quickly, though, it has not stopped bothering me since I read it that [spoiler](/s ""so, the Dauntless sometimes like to get tattoos and facial piercings, yes? But there's never attention to the fact that fresh tattoos in a fight would hurt like anything, and facial piercings are begging to be ripped out in a fight or any ""daring"" Dauntless activity. I mean, I was even thinking about what hair length and styling would do in a fight--I grew up on Tamora Pierce, who had her long-haired heroine Beka braid leather spiked straps into her hair in order to reverse a potential weakness in a fight."")

I'm going to read *Mazerunner* relatively soon, which I've heard great things about. I'm also interested in reading *Battle Royale*.

1ri9fc_1,1ri9fc,"That was a fascinating story, thanks for linking it!  I've been meaning to read more Asimov.

In answer to your question... The premise of Divergent is kind of similar, in that the protagonist has some extraordinary brain quirk that differs them from their regimented society.  But honestly, they're nothing alike beyond that.  

And if you were asking the unspoken, ""Do you recommend Divergent?"" I would say, ""Not really, unless you like YA fiction already.""  It's a quick read and has some good action scenes, but I found it shallow and kind of dumb. ",hawsil30500,2013-11-26T21:18:27Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Divergent,1

I really hope someone comes on here and says the two are different. I never read the Hunger Games because I feel like the series is just a rip off of the movie Battle Royale.
