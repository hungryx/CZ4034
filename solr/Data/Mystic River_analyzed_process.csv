17ozqfi_2,17ozqfi,I haven’t read Mystic River but I will now. I really enjoyed Shutter Island. The film is very disappointing,johnsgrove,2023-11-06T11:00:27Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Mystic River,2

17ozqfi_4,17ozqfi,"I had mixed feelings about Mystic River.  It was the first book by Dennis Lehane that I read.  I was awed by his skill, I read a lot of thrillers so have read a lot of crap.  But I felt really wrecked by the time I finished it, it's a very depressing book.  I would still recommend it.",Lollc,2023-11-08T05:27:06Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Mystic River,4
17ozqfi_5,17ozqfi,"I liked Shutter Island (book) better than Mystic River, but both are excellent. You should read MR, because you’ll probably love it.",FilthyDaemon,2023-11-07T16:54:02Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Mystic River,5
17ozqfi_6,17ozqfi,"After Mystic River becoming one of my all-time favorites, I've read 4/6 of Kezie & Gennaro series, and it became one of my favorite detective series. He is really good. Now I really want to watch The Wire, because he wrote it.",,2023-11-06T14:24:07Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Mystic River,6
mo4oyq_1,mo4oyq,"Mystic River and Shutter Island are two of my favorite mystery novels. 

I'd also recommend The Given Day by him, which is a bit different since it's more historical fiction than a crime novel, but still great.",allmilhouse,2021-04-10T16:56:10Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Mystic River,1
jv2xa5_1,jv2xa5,"Mystic River is the best book I have read in ages. As others have commented, Dennis is one of the more insightful writers of our time; he just connects s certain way. I have read all of his books multiple times and highly recommend them all (Since We Fell was OK and Moonlight Mile is a continuation in the Kenzie Genarro series but anyway....)

Before you read Live by Night or World Gone By, read the first of the three called The Given Day. Dennis takes a fictional narrative and weaves in many factual events brilliantly. I won't spoil it but the character story of Luther is extremely engaging. Reading it now for the 4th time.

Shutter Island is so much better than the movie and all of the Kenzie Genarro novels are first rate, especially Gone Baby Gone which again, is way better than the movie it was made in to. (read these in order first)

Again, MR is his best in my opinion but also The Drop is Boston Crime Noir at its finest and there is another short of his called Until Gwen that fucking slays.

Dennis rules. I have no idea what the train reference is though...",PALM_ARE,2021-03-06T04:36:59Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Mystic River,1
