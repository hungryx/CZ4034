kb4ws8_2,kb4ws8,"It's surely the best book to be based on the question 'What if Just William was literally the Antichrist?""

I loved it when I first read it, years ago. When I re-read it after the TV adaptation came out, I still loved it, but I noticed a few things that would need a bit of tweaking if it was published today (most of which are tweaked in the TV version, but there's still the fridge-logic realisation that Anathema has known all her life not only that Armageddon will happen soon, but that >!some rando will have a car accident in the middle of it and be brought to her door, and that they're destined to promptly - ahem - *'reach out to one another'*.!< It's a good thing she's such a well-grounded person).

Thematically, the Discworld book closest to Good Omens is Sourcery (and its follow-up, ~~Faust~~ Eric), which is IMO are the best stories to feature Rincewind, Pratchett's fabulously incompetent wizard.",Velinder,2020-12-11T18:11:57Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,2
kb4ws8_3,kb4ws8,"I love Good Omens. I read it first when I was pregnant and the scene where Sister Mary Loquacious is trying to name the babies had me in fits of giggles. It was a running joke that that we were going to go with Wormwood. Or Damien, that’s a very nice name. Or Warlock! 

Got lots of weird looks but for the one or two that instantly got the joke, it was worth the stammering “oh. Why *that* name? Is it a family name?” As a bonus, I found a few of my friends were definitely Gaiman fans lol.",TheBeneGesseritWitch,2020-12-12T05:46:12Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,3

kb4ws8_12,kb4ws8,"I loved it. I bought it last year, the day after I finished the show, and in less than a week I had devoured it.

It was the first book written (at least partially) by Terry Pratchett, and it made me immediately fall in love with his writing. In fact, it took some time for me to finally get around and do this, mainly because I looked for it in Italian then I realized it didn't exist etc., but this year I actually started reading the Discworld series! (I've started out with Guards! Guards! and now I'm within the first 100 pages of Men At Arms)

So yeah, I love Good Omens. It's funny and witty just like you said, and it has its own theatrical atmosphere (very *British*) that I really enjoyed. It made me think of the R.E.M. song ""It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)"".

Pratchett's Discworld books that are set in Ankh-Morpork tend to use a lot of references to London-y things. But I would recommend Small Gods if you like religious satire. It's more like a parallel to Christianity and how they went from crusades to knocking on doors ""spreading the word"". Great stuff.

Edit: The beginning of Good Omens may feel a little disjointed coz they've written it kinda like intro scenes to a movie with a massive cast. It comes together in a bit, builds up to a pretty great book.",,2020-12-11T17:53:41Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,25

18l9j5p_1,18l9j5p,"Both Good Omens & Hitchhikers Guide are *very* rooted in specifically British culture in the 1980s-90s, because that's the culture that all three authors (Pratchett, Gaiman & Adams) were intimately familiar with.

The passage from GO you picked out is poking fun at places that offer activities for ""corporate retreats"", such as paintball, that try to make themselves seem more interesting by pointing out the history of the building that the activity happens in - even though its irrelevant to the activity.",rheasilva,2023-12-18T14:19:42Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,1
18l9j5p_2,18l9j5p,"It's satire. Prachett and Adams used it for the basis of their comedy. However, satire only works if you know the thing being mocked. For most of Prachett it helps to know a bit of British history, culture, and politics. Good Omens plays with Christianity, the Church, and a certain kind of middle class idealism.

If you read Discworld it will be fantasy tropes, politics, culture, and some English lit.  

I think that you might not be ready for satire in English.",Smooth-Review-2614,2023-12-18T14:21:16Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,2
18l9j5p_3,18l9j5p,"As a huge fan of Terry Pratchett, this style of writing is typical of his books because it's heavy satire. In particular, he likes to insert whole paragraphs worth of asides to make a point about general society that's related to the main plot being talked about. So you have to be ready for a lot of non sequiturs and convoluted sentence structure, which is definitely tough as a non-native speakers.

I will say that the humor from Good Omens is particularly tough for me even though I love the book, because so much of the satire requires you to know some specific things about 80s British culture and I'm neither British enough nor old enough to know those references. If you want to try similar satirical writing that might be less based in a culture you don't know, the Discworld books might be a good place to start. Especially if you've read a good amount of sci-fi or fantasy, much of the satire is around the tropes of those genres.",frisbeescientist,2023-12-18T14:57:52Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,3

But I cannot verse Pratchett well in English at all. There are so many humorous references, wordplays, things steeped in English culture - it’s difficult. I have resorted to reading him in my native langue. Recently I reread a book in English and it was a treat, because some things are just not very translatable. But I was able to focus on them because I had familiarity with the book. 
Can you pick up Good Omens in your native language? If it’s your style of humor it’s a great read. Super chaotic storyline though. 😂",Tintenklex,2023-12-18T14:32:30Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,5
18l9j5p_6,18l9j5p,"As other people have mentioned, Good Omens and Hitchhikers Guide are deeply rooted in Satire, which is one of the most sophisticated uses of any language. Not only must you be fluent, you must also have a deep knowledge base of things that are culturally important, and equally, taken for granted by the culture of the writers.

If you want sci-fi that might be more approachable, I recommend the Expanse books, the TV series can help clarify what might be confusing. Also Ursula K Le Guin’s Left Hand of Darkness and Dispossessed utilize clear language to describe what is happening. 

If you want a good and interesting time travel book, Doomsday Book by Connie Willis is a good read. A lot of “Britishism” but more approachable than Pratchett for folks who have had less exposure to Brit Cultural Norms.

Frank Herbert’s Dune is a fantastic slow burn that has a glossary in the back. A wonderful critique on Feudalism with an exiting sci-fi setting. 

I don’t recommend Neil Gaiman to newer English readers  because he’s not interested in plot as a writer, he’s stated multiple times he’s more into mood and setting. This can leave folks without all of the implied context on hand feeling like the work is overly thin and nonsensical.

I would suggest, perhaps, trying to read some of his young adult stuff. The Graveyard Book, for example, is aimed more at children, but it's still a fantastic story with some excellent ideas. It's an exciting fantasy, and has a lot of the same kind of supernatural mystery and weirdness as his more adult books do, but the writing is a lot more understandable.

That might serve as a good way for you to ease your way into his writing style, but with something a bit more manageable to begin with.",QuerulousPanda,2023-12-18T18:22:41Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,8
18l9j5p_9,18l9j5p,"I disagree with the people saying you need a specific knowledge of British culture in order to enjoy *Good Omens*. I think it’s a matter of reading style. Pratchett (and sometimes Gaiman) writes with a very colloquial style so you can’t just flatly read the words on the page but you need to sort of imagine their “delivery” in order to get the most meaning out of them.

Remember the kids in school who would read out loud very monotonously? The. Fork. Ran. Away. With. The. Spoon. Each word was siloed and its meaning/interpretation stands alone. But that’s not really how words work in conversations. Now imagine how David Tennant would say the same thing: The fork *ran away* with the **spoon**.

I guess what I’m saying is your comprehension will improve dramatically if you imagine a bit of dramatic narration in your head as you’re reading. 😉",SophiaofPrussia,2023-12-18T15:29:18Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,9
18l9j5p_10,18l9j5p,"I really think it’s because English isn’t your first language, especially if you would call your proficiency level “beginner reader.” Both Good Omens and Hitchhiker’s Guide have this quirky and extremely British style of language. What’s fun and interesting about the book is not just the story and characters but in the way they play around with the language, and that kind of play is very hard for someone who isn’t fully fluent in a language to access and appreciate. My family on my dad’s side is from the Netherlands, and I know just a little bit of Dutch, and those of my paternal family who are most proficient in English have all agreed that puns and jokes that rely on playing-on-words were the *very last* thing to click into place when they became fluent in English. It’s high-level stuff!

I think it’s really impressive to have any kind of proficiency in more than one language (I hope to get there with Dutch one day, for family reasons, and Spanish also, for its usefulness in the U.S.!). And there’s no shame at all to me in finding it difficult, especially when you’re going for a book that’s more complex in the language - either because it’s a not-totally-modern form of English (eg Jane Austen’s work, she lived and wrote in the Regency period) or because it’s a particular voice/style from a particular region (Good Omens, Hitchhiker’s Guide). I hope this experience doesn’t discourage you - maybe keep these books to try again later?

18l9j5p_12,18l9j5p,"You are missing the second dash there that separates out a chunk of this sentence. The punctuation is very important because it's what makes this sentence readable for a native speaker.

*First piece of information set off by a comma:* [Sometimes this sort of leaflet had a little historical bit],

*Second piece of information:* because the kind of companies that hired places like this for a weekend [. . .] liked to feel that they were strategically interacting in the very building [. . .] that some Elizabethan financier had endowed as a plague hospital.

*Humorous detail:* of Interactive Personnel Analysis or A Conference on the Strategic Marketing Dynamic

*Humorous detail:* —give or take a couple of complete rebuildings, a civil war, and two major fires—

This sentence is not really meant to be easily readable on the first go; native speakers may have to break it down mentally like above. Many will not understand the full thought just reading it once. They would be more likely to have it ""click"" right away hearing it read out loud, but in a book they may have to read it through twice to understand what the pacing and tone of each part is supposed to be. This is not a flaw in this type of satirical writing style, but a feature. The need to reread it and the feeling you get when it clicks for you is often what makes the joke really funny. Hitchhiker's Guide and Good Omens are also full of much simpler sentences that are likewise intended for rereading because what they say is simply so unexpected.

This type of book is not meant to be fluid; reading it is more like being told a story by a comedian, keeping in mind that someone telling a story verbally will use tone, pacing, and pauses to help but a book cannot do this. It's okay for it not to flow and it's okay to have to think hard about it, because it's overly complicated and a bit rambling on purpose. There are not a lot of authors who write in this specific way and it's very advanced for a non-native speaker, and that's okay because they're not always easy books for native speakers either. The audiobooks may be significantly easier for you to follow.

Hitchhiker's Guide and Good Omens are my two favourite books and have been since childhood. My dad gave me Hitchhiker's Guide to read when I was nine because I'd grown up loving watching Monty Python's Flying Circus and other British comedies with him (although we are not British). I was a highly advanced and voracious reader and had been primed with lots of media with a similar sense of humour, but Hitchhiker's Guide *blew my mind*. It was completely different in tone and language than anything I'd ever read before, and it had a far more profound impact on my sense of humour and writing style than anything else I've ever read. It is *very, very different* from almost anything else you will ever come across, and honestly many native speakers have never read anything like it in their lives. So do not worry about it being difficult.",alloutofbees,2023-12-18T20:26:33Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,12
18l9j5p_13,18l9j5p,"It's strange, because I love Good Omens/HHGTTG/Discworld novels for exactly the same reasons that the OP hates them.

Personally, I felt that Gaiman & Pratchett were intentionally channelling Adams's style of writing when they wrote Good Omens, and Adams was heavily into satirizing British culture. This is exactly what Gaiman & Pratchett did in Good Omens. 

The humour in these books is very distinct. It is very Pythonesque. I think, when I first watched Monty Python, I didn't 'get it' either. I was either too young, or hadn't developed a sense of the absurd. - The Ministry of Silly Walks? The Dead Parrot? Spam? The Larch? - What was all of this nonsense?? It was a bunch of short surreal sketches that sometimes didn't have a punchline, and didn't make much sense. 

As I grew a bit older, and more aware that the world was an absurd place, I realised what Monty Python was trying to do, and revisiting those episodes with a different perspective. I had that epiphany. 

Exactly the same thing with HHGTTG - The book was funny in parts when I first read it when I was about 11 or 12, but I was confused by some of it. I didn't have an awareness of Schrodinger or Einstein's scientific principles, for example. Reading lines like ""The ships hung in the sky the way that brick's don't"", on the other hand, didn't need any of that. It was just a funny joke.

With Good Omens, though, I recognised the style of humour straight away, and had the awareness of what the authors were poking fun at. From the Edward Bulwer-Lytton alternative, through the paradoxical nature of the Bible, the cheesy Omen movies, Enid Blyton books, religious ideologies through the centuries, the Inferno, witchcraft, British sensibilities and the ideas that Good and Evil are not set in stone, I did not have the same struggles, and for me, it was a treasure trove of jokes and sharp observations.",trelloskilos,2023-12-19T07:50:31Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,13

Go and get a book written by Dick Francis. He wrote good detective stories, highly successful page-turners. And they are \*very\* easy to read by people that are learning English and are starting to read in English to improve the language. I was in the same position as you. I started with ""simplified editions"" - books in English that are re-written to use simple vocabulary and grammar. There are many levels of difficulty. After I finished all the simplified editions for English learners our library had, I took home a bunch of books and had to return them unread. In desperation I saw a Dick Francis book and borrowed it. I have read most of his books in translation and I knew he writes page-turners. I breezed through the book, once I sorted out the horse-racing vocabulary. But that is only a small hurdle.

Honestly, it's exhausting. I didn't really enjoy Good Omens when I read it, perhaps because of dense writing like this that kept pulling me out of the story.

2. Both books are very conversational, so every sentence, not just dialog, are written how people speak, with a lot of asides, conversational short cuts  off set by conversational ramblings.

3. Both books have a ""back story"" that they just jump back and forth between story events and ""historical or technological explanations"" of why things are the way they are. Good Omens actually has 2 ""back stories"" they jump around in - The angel/demon historical activity & the Angness Nutter prophecies. It can be very confusing.

4. Both are setup in a universe w/ a bunch of different rules, so their are extra words and concepts that get explained in English, but don't have any actual real world reference and therfore the explanations may not make sense if you are translating them in your head to something you are farmilar with.

I would start with some more linear, non-satirical fiction to get your feet wet as a beginner.

Pro-tip: Once you are ready to tackle Good Omens again, either watch ""The Omen"" (1976, or 2006 remake) or read the book first. A healthy portion of the book is making fun of the tropes in ""The Omen"".",Corpuscular_Ocelot,2023-12-18T20:49:15Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,29

I always recommend Agatha Christie if you’re looking for a classic that is part of the culture but also “easy,” meaning that you can just jump in and enjoy a good high quality story! If you were not bored by Jane Austen, you may prefer historical fiction over science fiction or fantasy.

I do not like this style of writing myself, just not enjoyable to me at all normally. Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker's guide) is another one who ""goes off"" on soliloquies or gets sidetracked all the time but his work I greatly enjoy.

But the book I read just wasn't very good. I've not even been interested to give any other of his books a try if they're going to be similar. So it might be an unpopular opinion, but I'm not sure if the TV writing translates all that well to book writing.

Second, these are very hard to read.  Hard in a way that is deceptive. They are not big words you can look up in a dictionary, they are big concepts that make sense to adults who grew up in the culture the book is from. Humor is always the hardest thing to grasp in a new language, and this is advanced humor. I had to stop reading Good Omens to my daughter because I was explaining every sentence. She is a native English speaker but she never lived in Britain and she has never worked an office job. Those points of reference are important.

Heck, even some native English speakers might struggle if they're not from the UK.

Basically you're just missing a lot of context. Both language context and cultural context. If that makes any sense.

Colloquialisms are words that have different meanings to different locations. For example a boot in America is tall and heavy footwear, but in Britain it's the storage area in the back of a car (trunk, in America).",Arvandor,2023-12-19T02:44:29Z,0,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,66

Gaiman and Pratchett are very similar in many ways, but Gaiman's approach is somewhat more *surreal.* Neverwhere is spectacular.  

Honestly, reading any Discworld book and  Gaiman's Neverwhere and you pretty much instantly can form the ideas behind Good Omens in one's head. The satire, the humor, the clever wordplay is almost all Pratchett.

For people who want to get into English lit, I strongly agree that good YA novels are a great starting point, as they're aimed at less context-aware humans who won't get meta jokes about corporate retreats yet.

jsc81f_8,jsc81f,"So here's something to consider. Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.

Terry Pratchett's development as an author is one who mastered people, at least fictional people. His characters feel real in the way they act and respond to their environment.

Neil Gaiman is a man that is obsessed with story, in a meta sense. He loves stories about stories, stories about how we make stories and how these stories outlive their origins and grow to become something more (see American Gods, ""Dream"" comic book series etc.)

In Good Omens, these two things come together really, REALLY fucking well.

The mythology aspects of the apocalypse are really well done by Gaiman, who probably worked on the settings and plot.

The characters of Crowley, Aziraphale and Adam are probably in large part, products of Pratchett. Crowley and Aziraphale are stranded adversaries, who find that, to be really honest, the people above them have no idea about their day to day. Ever had a boss who didn't understand your job and was only interested in the outcomes. The Angels and Devils and all the metaphysical forces see the world as their chessboard, but its real to Crowley and Aziraphale. They love it and will defend it. When it's threatened, the act accordingly, like real people would. They try to do their best to minimise the threat of the antichrist while risking as little exposure as possible to themselves. When the story starts, they're cowards. The stakes have to rise more and more to get them to act in a non-conservative manner. This escalates throughout the book. Adam is the best character in the book. He is a child. A precocious one, but one nonetheless. Outside, of any angelic or infernal influence, he becomes the epitome of the very centre between the two. Absolutely Human, with a capital H.

The culmination of the book is that very fact.

The journey there is what the book wants to show you about yourself. It's kind of a love letter to the human race, at least that's how I see it.   

That, and its execution makes it a classic for me.

Maybe you have to be more familiar with Discworld and Gaimans work to have a greater appreciation it.",the_stickiest_one,2020-11-11T20:42:06Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,8

Pratchett's signature is the juxtaposition of the mundane and the fantastic, be it for humourous or for dramatic effect (he pulls off either at different time). Gaiman's signature is that he creates fascinating tableaus that you enjoy exploring in great detail, even if not all that much happens (a little bit like Wes Anderson movies).  

Combining the two runs the risk of creating a tableau of the mundane, which is why some readers find Good Omens quite ponderous. If you find Crowley and Aziraphale to be incredibly interesting and cool then you will revel in all the time spent digging into their back-story and relationship, while the plot kind of meanders along in the background as an afterthought.

The TV miniseries was a bit more fun, mostly due to the strong cast I think, but overall the story still didn’t do much for me.

If you enjoyed The Graveyard Book, try more of Neil Gaiman; don’t let Good Omens put you off. Coraline or Stardust are similar, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a little stranger, or American Gods is much bigger and darker. All well worth a look.

The fact that it became such a huge success was not only a surprise to readers but to the authors themselves. 

If you haven't seen the Amazon series, you should watch it. Gaiman was in almost complete control of the production so alot of the humor that Pratchett wrote into the story transferred over to the show. Which makes it easier to understand.

It doesn't have the dark sort of fairy-tale brooding of Gaiman's stuff that I like and the Pratchett influence just sort of feels like a muted version of his usual writing if any of that makes sense. Like you can definitely see the influences of both authors, but reading it to me just felt like something that ended up being somehow less than the sum of its parts.

I fully understand this is heresy to a lot of people, but I've also met a lot of people who have read Good Omens and loved it, but never read much of either authors' other works other than, maybe, American Gods.

As a fiction writer he hadn’t found his style yet and I think that shows by the book as a whole feeling very much to be Pratchett’s voice. 

Secondly, the story structure is that of a parallel narrative, with many equally weighted storylines, each with their own protagonists. In Good Omens these protagonists move inexorably towards the final climax when they all come together at a single place and time. Parallel narratives can often feel messy and be a bit challenging to follow. I’ve found it can help to focus on how the characters are being moved to that final meeting, the journey often revealing their importance, rather than trying to suss out who they are as soon as they appear.",endophage,2020-11-12T02:22:42Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,103

I think Pratchett's plot writing is a lot easier to see *in retrospect* than in the moment. He loves to write endings that call back to all the small interactions you thought were just window dressing, but fit perfectly with the themes of the main conflict. Granny Weatherwax is the epitome of this - it's really hard to understand her ""clever practical solutions *are* magic"" point of view, until you get to the climax of the story, and you see that all of her small errands lead to a perfect logical solution to the problem. Going Postal is another great example of this kind of plot-by-worldbuilding, and it has one of my favorite endings in all of fantasy, besides the Bartimaeus trilogy and LotR.",Greaserpirate,2020-11-12T03:25:47Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,112

jsc81f_120,jsc81f,"Good Omens is a collaboration work between Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. 

It feels so much more like a Terry Pratchett book to me. The personification of famine, war, pestilence/pollution, and death are nearly straight out of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. 

I think Neil Gaimen may be responsible for some of the character work. But its so much more a Pratchett book to me. 

It also IS more scattered than Pratchett AND Gaimens other work. Its a flaw. Basically tbe scattered nature comes from not understanding that a scene has changed and thst these seemingly unrelated scenes are connected. It always seemed to me that it was written as if it was a screenplay not a novel. Hence tbe heavy reliance on numerous scenes and transitions. 

Even with its flaws It is a great book. I've read it twice. Its a parody of tbe 1980 and 1990 Omen demon antichrist child horror movies of that Era. 

Pratchett is a satirist. Every character he ever made was satirical. Pratchett is a philosopher as well with a positive eworld outlook.

It is too scattered. It does come to a point later but it probably just isn't the kind of book I would like.
 The whole book is too 'wordy'. I see where the authors are trying to be funny but it's just like reading words and words, not an actual story. 

I like the characters of Aziraphale, Crowley, Pepper, Adam etc. But it's just so weird and pointless. The whole book was like a wild goose chase, literally. All these characters looking for Adam. 

Most of the characters were just standing on the stage crowding it with absolutely no contribution at all. The whole 'witchfinder' thing. The annoying character of the sergeant, that Madame Truffey. 
What were they even doing? Pulsifier and even Anathema Device. They had a role just for the sake of it. Oh and even the four 'horsemen' not to talk about the completely unnecessary bar scene  and the other four 'horsemen'
Only Crowley, Aziraphale seemed to have an actual role and contribution to the plot of the story.",Ok_Impression_8145,2023-03-28T05:56:12Z,0,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,137

If you like more linear storytelling, I'd strongly recommend Gaiman's *American Gods* before you throw the towel in. Having read several of Pratchett's Discworld books and most of Gaimen's works, I have to admit that *Good Omens*, while I appreciate it, is not my favorite from either author. I'm an American in my 30's and miss a lot of the references, try as I might.

jsc81f_140,jsc81f,"I have an old (mid 1990's) interview with Neil Gaiman where he points out that Good Omens was written by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett trying to make each other laugh. Most of the aspects you mention follow from that: the off-the-wall humor, the footnotes, the copying each others' styles, the 'hey, look, another cool thing' tempo of the book.

And after 300-odd pages of faffing about, they sent the whole thing to a publisher, it somehow got greenlit and became a cult hit, and here we are. Gaiman himself mentions in that interview that they had no interest in doing a sequel because of the weight of expectations. I believe he quipped in typical Gaiman-esque fashion that 'men with very serious briefcases and very thin watches have to have several meetings before Terry and I are allowed in the same room'.

So Good Omens is what it is: two talented, off-beat writers jamming on a typewriter. It resonated because there wasn't anything like it at the time, it helped launch two lauded careers (and this helped the book stay in the spotlights), and it's eminently quotable. But there's not any *more* to it than that: there's no hidden code, no perspective-switching realisation, no volumes of literary analysis. There's nothing to *get*: it's a clever funny fantasy book, and if it's not for you, that's perfectly okay.",,2020-11-11T23:33:58Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,140

It's not at all representative of Gaiman's writing, but it's hard to put Neil Gaiman in an exact box (he did write *Don't Panic* about HHGTTG, after all, very much in that style).

Good Omens is one of my favorite books and Pratchett and Gaiman are two of my favorite writers, but Good Omens does feel like a Pratchett novel based on a Gaiman premise with some Gaiman writing splashed in. Which makes sense, Pratchett was a much more established writer at the time it was written while Gaiman had less published works.

hlbsxy_16,hlbsxy,"If you like multiple narratives converging, the interesting, humorous way things are described, and Death himself, that's Pratchett's part of GO. The heart of why Adam acts the way he does, little boy idyllics, the warm relationships, and the ineffable themes running through is Gaiman's part.

Discworld keeps Pratchett's themes, and Gaiman carries those themes in his writing. For Gaiman, if you like Adam's story line or the Witch and that fella, read The Ocean at the End of the Lane. If you like the 4 horsemen, read Mort (Pratchett) or American Gods (Gaiman).

I think it's a fantastic book, but I think you should be aware that Gaimen's writing can vary a lot from book to book. AG is slow-paced, thoughtful, and weird and for a lot of it nothing much seems to be happening. If you're in the right mood for it, AG is amazing. If you're not, it's boring.

hlbsxy_20,hlbsxy,"Honestly I think that Pratchett wasn't as good at narrative in the early Discworld books.  I think that he had a tendency to make so many aside jokes (as footnotes) that it disrupted his ability to build a cohesive narrative.  

I've always thought that Good Omens stands on its own so well because it was Pratchett's ability to ridiculously reinterpret of a lot of scenes that would have otherwise been pretty standard reined in by Gaiman's stronger control of the narrative.  The first two books in the Discworld series suffered from a weak narrative and you can watch his writing style mature as the Discworld books progress.",jux589,2020-07-05T11:38:26Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,20

Good Omens though, the soul of it hinges very much on the tone of the narration, you can't just leave it out, and an actuall narrator (like with A Series of Unfortunate Events) would probably be a bit cringey (YMMV).

Funny enough, American Gods is my standout favorite book (ha!

I read The Sandman in it's entirety around 2005 and was absolutely blown away by. It really got me back into comics. Covering the rest of Gaiman's work actually led me to Pratchett by way of Good Omens. Probably my favorite of his works, besides The Sandman, is Anansi Boys. I really liked American Gods, and Anansi was my favorite character from it so the follow up title really resonated with me, actually hit close to home.

Good Omens hit home. Every page was full of little UK idiosyncrasies and littered with mentions and references to those obscure places you’d only really know about if you’ve lived in the UK or visited enough to have stepped outside the typical tourist itinerary. It made me laugh because I felt it was making fun of me.

I loved the quirkiness, the wit, the sincerity with which it spoke. Honestly one of my favourite books. I can’t even compare it to any of Neil or Sir Terry’s other works because this book reigns its own category.",outstorm,2019-04-06T16:11:31Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,9

I would recommend The Bromeliad Trilogy if you want to stick with Pratchett. They're actually kids books, but they're great fun to read and don't really feel like kids books. I reread all three often, once every year and a half or so, and I enjoy them just as much each time as I did the first.

As for how to get into reading, I would start by looking at the TV shows and movies you like and try to figure out why you like them. For example, if you like the Marvel movies, maybe you enjoy adventure stories with a hero's journey and a redemption arc, witty dialogue, and a low level of fantasy or futurism. Or, if you enjoy The Devil Wears Prada, it might be for the subtle social commentary, sharp dialogue, and luxurious atmosphere.

Ok, so, after you make a list of two or three specific movies or shows and the elements you like in them, take that list to your local library. Go to the information desk or checkout desk, tell them you're wanting to start reading more. Give them your list. They will help you find a book or two, and will probably give you a list of others to try when you're done with those.

I absolutely loved Good Omens, and I've been on a bit of a humor kick so I recommend a lot of the discworld books. ""Equal Rites"" is one of my recent reads, can't recommend it enough. I've noticed Pratchett seems to have this third quarter of the book pattern where the humor dies down a bit but he's setting up an absolutely wild finish so if you're like me you might have to really push to get through that third quarter, or risk putting it down for a while. Also ""Small Gods"" was good.

If you want a satire kind of humor I really liked Catch-22. Now, it's about war so parts of it are really, really rough. Couple of passages I had to just kinda sit there and recover after reading. But, very good.

I just finished reading Good Omens
It is too scattered. It does come to a point later but it probably just isn't the kind of book I would like.
 The whole book is too 'wordy'. I see where the authors are trying to be funny but it's just like reading words and words, not an actual story. 

I like the characters of Aziraphale, Crowley, Pepper, Adam etc. But it's just so weird and pointless. The whole book was like a wild goose chase, literally. All these characters looking for Adam. 

Most of the characters were just standing on the stage crowding it with absolutely no contribution at all. The whole 'witchfinder' thing. The annoying character of the sergeant, that Madame Truffey. 
What were they even doing? Pulsifier and even Anathema Device. They had a role just for the sake of it. Oh and even the four 'horsemen' not to talk about the completely unnecessary bar scene  and the 'other four horsemen'. 

Only Crowley, Aziraphale seemed to have an actual role and contribution to the plot of the story.",Ok_Impression_8145,2023-03-28T06:04:25Z,0,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,13

The adaptations of the works of Terry Pratchett have been surprisingly inoffensive. Not like incredible, groundbreaking artistry, but very solid and entertaining. Captured surprising amounts of that Pratchett-magic. I have hope that Good Omens won't suck, but it could honestly go any which way at this point. 

I think the most likely scenario is that it will be ""pretty alright"", with fans of the book being divided between the group that could never be satisfied and the group that is so blinded by love that they don't care about whether the actual show is good.

The TV series did an amazing job of bringing it to the screen.

The authors complemented each other very well.

I think it's important to stress how much the story is a humanist tale. A repeating theme is the simarity between angels and demons and ,for the most part, their indifference to humanity.

Of course with the exception of 2 of the main characters who have become more human and grown closer to each other  after thousands of years on earth.

If you read pratchetts discworld stories you'll see similar themes with The Auditors representing the forces of a cold and indifferent universe keen to grind humanity into dust while the 4 (5) horsemen have grown closer to humanity.

In good omens most of the machinations of heaven, hell and even the main characters turn out to be almost irrelevant. They're just spinning their wheels for the most part.

Discworld is wonderful, I think a lot of people may discount it because it appears at first glance a bit ""dungeons and dragons"" but the writing style and the characters are FAR more modern and incredibly well crafted, more like characters from Sci-Fi than Lord of The Rings, and with a fantastic sense of humour (think Douglas Adams) in the narration, world-building and overall writing.

I'd really recommend everyone suspend their scepticism about fantasy for at least one Terry Pratchett book just to give it a try - Night Watch is one that comes very highly recommended, as do the entire *Watch* series.

It's *almost* a shame that most of the Discworld stuff is so fantastic that it's almost impossible to adapt to the screen. Good Omens managed the job incredibly well but that world is very similar to our own.",JCDU,2023-08-21T13:00:43Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,5

Sometime in grade school we had to write a book report on a book of our choosing.

Good Omens would have made for a more accessible book report.

Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (2016) was another good adaptation. I thought the first season was special & the Men of the Machine was a rich enough idea to justify a spinoff

At first they used it to swap into animal bodies as a spiritual experience>!, but soon realized they could use it for material gains too.

Oh! I've got it! Keanu Reeves as Crowley and Angelina Jolie as Aziraphale! Make the movie all about them, and turn it into a love story.

Either way, I agree on their looks for those roles, and your reasoning! Benedict playing angry as Sherlock was quite terrifying, looked very inhuman at points in A Study In Pink even, so him as Crowley would be fantastic.

The thing of which I spoke:

Okay, so Benedict was/is in Frankenstein onstage. Well, in the US at least, they are showing, in select theaters, two recordings of this show on two different nights. One of the nights, Benedict plays Dr. Frankenstein, and someone else plays the monster. The OTHER night, Benedict plays the monster, and the actor who previously played the monster now plays Dr. Frankenstein.

I've also had an academic/outsider interest in Christianity without being a follower of any religion.

Anyway, all the British humor works for me, the pop culture references hit for me, the treatment of Christian religion hits for me.  Humor is always going to be one of those things that either works or doesn't for each person. Written humor is also more complicated than live-action.

Part of why it feels weird to read is that you've two very different senses of very odd and slightly whacky humor, and there could be some overall cross-Pond culture shock.

My friend, an American with American parents and family, got a different read than I did (dual citizenship, with more than half my family in the UK). Our different lives gave us different takes, which was kinda neat and you don't see that super often.

Neverwhere is probably my favorite Gaiman book and it's actually way more linear. I'd give it a try, it might work better for what you want.

ppl4p1_16,ppl4p1,"Yeah, good catch, OP wasn’t asking about foot notes, OP was saying that they find the elaborate exposition of Good Omens makes the narrative difficult to follow because it distracts them from whatever is happening. 

I want to add that, while Gaiman doesn’t typically go on for nested exposition like how we see in Good Omens, he does tend to juggle topics or narratives in his writing. One of the most recognizable examples of this would be in American Gods, where throughout the book there are little “Coming to America” segments, where things are happening that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but they do serve to immerse the reader in the setting. 
Another example would be in Neverwhere, where the narrative often breaks away to give the reader insight on what Croup and Vandemar are up to, or some little scheme the Marquis de Carabas is working on behind the scenes. 
Sandman is probably, however, the most prolific example, where you sometimes get lengthy stretches where the narrative switches completely to another character (The Corinthian, for example) or where a whole short story unfolds where Dream only appears as a peripheral character or doesn’t appear at all and it’s only after the short story the narrative goes back to whatever Dream is doing (example: the famous Midsummer Night’s Dream bit). These seem like distractions but they always become relevant later on. 

Just wanted to point that out because a lot of people in this thread are casually saying that it’s not typical of Gaiman‘a writing style and that’s partly true, but if OP finds the exposition in Good Omens taxing to read, then they might also find the layered narrative of some (not all) of Gaiman’s works to be equally unpleasant.",AfraidOfTechnology,2021-09-17T00:19:31Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,16

Terry Pratchett books are great for re-reading because he gives you part A and part C, but you have to work out part B yourself.  I find new things each time I re-read them.

c6vxa3_2,c6vxa3,"It's hard for Doctor Who fans to realize that it's not for everyone. My advice would be to start with the Christopher Eccleston season (even though I'm not a fan of his Doctor) because it really makes the transition to Tennant that much sweeter and you see the enormous growth between him and Rose. The first bit of Matt Smith's run is good, but it gets cute pretty quick and I'll admit I lost interest. Peter Capaldi brought it back with a gruff and surly portrayal and I'll also admit that I need to catch up and watch all of his episodes because I really did get derailed by the second Matt Smith season and so on. I've watched a bit of Jodie Whittaker's show and I really do like it. It's a big change that the show needed and I'd like to get back on track. That all being said, I think the Tennant seasons just have a really special place in the hearts of any modern Doctor Who fan. It's not the rage it once was (well, not outside of England at least) but there were moments during that first season with Tennant that were some of the best in television history. It's a shame that Russell T. Davies had to leave.

Tennant has a magic about him that is intoxicating. You just can't help but feel like you'd jump off a building if he got excited about it and made it seem compelling. I'm the worst person to ask for advice for as far as Good Omens goes because I've really only seen a bit of it as a result of the fiasco with it. I do enjoy Neil Gaiman and what I've seen of the show has been pretty good, but perhaps not everything with mass appeal is going to scratch the itch for everyone. My advice would be to go to the original source as sometimes that can inspire a drive to get to know something better. Gaiman is a very talented writer (let alone Pratchett) and I know he's very proud of the show, so that's gotta say something for it, right?",funkalici0us,2019-06-29T07:46:41Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,2

9erzc5_1,9erzc5,"Good Omens always feels like it's much more a Terry Pratchett book,  than it is a Neil Gaiman book, in my opinion. The humour is more like Pratchett's, and the subject matter, as well as the inversion of the Antichrist story. This book has a little of Gaiman's darker edged cynicism, but it's mostly Pratchett.

I always really loved that Adam has the power of the Antichrist, but because he's been brought up as a normal boy, with a healthy group of family and friends, he instead chooses to live that quiet, idyllic life that we see in Tom Sawyer, or in the work of Enid Blyton and the Just William stories. He fashions the world into what he wants it to be.

Aziraphale and Crowley are a great double act, and I agree that the idea of this angel and this demon being friends, because they're just two working stiffs, and banding together to foil Crowley's boss, is a really great take on the angel/demon archetypes. Michael Sheen and David Tennant are going to have so much fun with this dynamic in the TV adaptation.

You should definitely try the Discworld books, because a lot of the themes in Good Omens are developed more there. I'd recommend starting with *Guards!

Also, if you're going to start with The Witches stream, I'd probably skip the first book, Equal Rites. One of my least favorites. I thought Pratchett dealt with women's rights / feminism in a really heavy-handed way in that book, and there just weren't a lot of laughs compared to his other works.

I thought this was a great read and gave a nice inside look at the collaboration between Gaiman and the late Pratchett, RIP.  ",TwigInTheDeepwoods,2017-08-16T12:34:24Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,1

53wmiw_2,53wmiw,"Well, I love Pratchett and Gaiman each on their own, and Good Omens is one of my all-time favorite books. 

Gaiman, I suppose, is not usually so overtly absurd or in your face about how ridiculous humanity is (he can be though - Stardust is very smartly silly).

Anyways, it's probably the subject matter - I mean, you can't really write humorously about The Anti-Christ without being really crazy :)

I think you should definitely give Pratchett a shot though - maybe Guards! Guards!

Good Omens, Neverwhere, Radio Four, stuff…
Many of you are probably as excited as I am that GOOD OMENS starts on BBC Radio 4 on Monday. 

Some of you are probably also going “Yes, but how do I listen to a foreign country’s RADIO? Argh!” 

(Some of you went through this last year with Neverwhere, and are old hands, and smiling vaguely at the group of puzzled people.)

So here is a way to get into practice. Andrew O’Neill has just done a show on the BBC about Gender. (He’s a transvestite heavy metal Doctor Who fan comedian.) Why don’t you listen to that?

The link is at http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04v3950. It will play on computers, but not on mobile devices. For those you’ll need an app, like TuneIn Radio…",248_RPA,2014-12-22T12:36:13Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Good Omens,1

15zra9w_2,15zra9w,"I wholeheartedly agree with your points.

For me the best example of good and gone-wrong adaptations is the ""The Secret Garden"":

The 1980s version is way too faithful to the book, following every plot point exactly, which makes it seem kinda stiff because it's missing context/atmosphere which is not conveyed through just the plot itself and doesn't connect the different scenes as would be necessary for a smooth experience.

The 1993 adaptation of the book is perfect. Every change made adds something important and they cut away scenes which are a bit repetitive, irrelevant or only work in a book. Plus, the cast, soundtrack and cinematography are just amazing. In my opinion it's really a masterclass in adaptation. The movie doesn't only keep the spirit/meaning of the book, but even enhances and expands on it.

And the 2020 version is just any mediocre children's movie with a dog (that doesn't exist in the book, but is somehow the most important thing in that movie), which they called ""The Secret Garden"" despite there not even being emphasis on any kind of secret garden.

&#x200B;

An honorable mention is ""Whale Rider"". It's mostly faithful to the book, but changes one thing that wouldn't have worked due to the different format. Incredible movie for a good book in my opinion.
