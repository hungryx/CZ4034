ubjymo_2,ubjymo,"Funny that you mention The Last Wish and The Witcher seires in general; one of my biggest author quirks is when they involve so many places and characters that I get lost and confused as to who is actually involved in the overall story line and who isn't. You may not have run into this problem so far, as The Last Wish isn't part of the actual Witcher series, but I ran into it a lot afterwords.

ubjymo_4,ubjymo,"Maybe it is, but it can still be trite. I haven't read the Last Wish myself so I can't say one way or the other.

Even in a serial repeating the same things over and over to your reader is bad writing. Arthur Conan Doyle doesn't start off every Sherlock story by telling you Sherlock is very smart. He will *show* you Sherlock is very smart, analytical, quirky, etc. but he does it in different ways, so that the character feels real and dynamic.

If the point is to say that Yennifer cares about her appearance, or to contrast her sensitivities with Geralt, there are countless ways to do it without reminding us what perfume she uses every time she's within smelling distance.",Dragon_Fisting,2022-04-25T18:28:57Z,2,2.0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,4

g2sfg0_1,g2sfg0,"Personally The Last Wish was my second favourite Witcher book. But I agree that one of the big weaknesses in the book were the portrayal of women...it's worse than the norm for 90s books imo. Largely the women are all carbon copies of one another with very little personality beyond coming off as extremely immature, constantly having temper tantrums and turning their noses up in the air (like Sapkowski's version of braid tugging imo). Only one that seemed to somewhat break that mould was Milva (you won't see her until Blood of Elves). 

Anyway personally I never had any issue with the prose. Actually quite liked the style of it. Can't say I ever found it confusing. But have heard people complain about prose before, some putting it down to translation (English translator changed afterwards).",D3athRider,2020-04-17T04:53:33Z,0,2.0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,1

These books tell a continuous story, while the last wish was just a reacount of short stories (if i remember correctly) which i also didn't find very immersive. 
There is also a prequel called ""zeit des sturms"" in german (time of the storm). This was my favourite of the books, but i couldn't find a english version of it online so i don't know if it has been translated yet.",ThomasTheTankAndGin,2022-01-30T14:37:49Z,2,2.0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,1

I'm Polish and I've read it as it was published.
Years later I picked up an English version of The Last Wish. I was curious how good was the translation. It's fine but it looses something in translation - maybe a bit of literary style or turn of the phrase. For me original was a joy to read while English version was quite dull. 

It works both ways. For example, Polish translations of Terry Pratchett's books are never as good as the English original.

The best analogy I can think of is a difference between an oli painting of the landscape and a perfect photo of exactly the same landscape. An oil painting is somehow nicer than a photo.",Felis1977,2023-09-06T18:55:04Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,11

My big gripe about the show is not keeping in some scenes that really give people a clue about Geralt in general. The scenes they left out when hunting the Dragon, for instance, would have provided some comedy (the dwarves), the lethality of monster hunting (Sir Ike fighting the dragon), and Geralt's code of ethics (refusing to kill it because its sentient) without bogging things down in the stupid love triangle of dumbassery that the writers want to push. 

The most interesting thing about Geralt of Rivia isn't that he's banging Yennifer.

75x6j1_1,75x6j1,"The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny are two collections of short stories. They are easily the best since both Sapkowski and the concept of the Witcher universe works best in that setting and short form. Witcher was conceived as a episodic format of stories published in fantasy magazines and then it was pulled together in Sword of Destiny with an overarching narrative in the form of an intertwined story.

Then it became huge in Poland which at the time was breaking out of communist bloc and had barely any western fantasy (except Tolkien, LeGuin and a few others) and the published wanted more so Sapkowski decided to write a saga.

The saga has 5 volumes plus the 6th rip-off after the games revived the character but it not nearly as good. Kind of  a slog and by the last two books you can get bored. Unless you like it.

I ended up switching to the audiobooks because of all the dialogue and world-building. Reading the books was bad per se but they can really can drag on. Seasons of Storms has been a low point in the series for me. The Last Wish was awesome.

I will say that playing the video games and watching the Netflix series prior to reading the books has probably lowered my expectations of the books. I’m quite invested in the Witcher world at this point and the books are supplementing my previous exposure to all the characters, places, and events.

3ki7p1_1,3ki7p1,"As a native speaker of the original language I had the chance to read the books as they were being published in the early 90s.  While the saga is a standalone story the writer assumed that most of the people who bought it were already familiar with the stories as they were the second biggest thing in Poland after Tolkien where fantasy was concerned.   So the truth is many details, flavours and other small things might escape you if you didn't read the stories because Sapkowski was writing it largely on his own without much help from the publisher as the modern popular markets in Poland were only starting at the time. So there was no ""last time on the Witcher"" put into the saga - very few explanations and many characters or events are given on the go. They don't prevent you from enjoying the series even if you might feel a bit confused but if you read the books chronologically then you get a much better picture. There are two books ""The Sword of Destiny"" and ""The Last Wish"" (published 1992 and 1993 but the The Last Wish tells earlier stories narration-wise ) and I do recommend that you read them before starting the series.   Many things might get lost in the translation if its not up to par but you'll still be better prepared.

But then again some people like to explore the world, some don't.. take your pick.

EDIT: Oh and the series has many hidden political and social undertones. Most of them should be clear for a westerner but the saga is set in a world that makes some nods towards Polish history in XX century. I recommend you read a quick overview of what happened and then you might pick up interesting or funny details. 
The games were a bit too overt with some things but they are a different medium. And for fans of the books it was actually pretty funny to see those things realized.",pharmaceus,2015-09-11T08:28:17Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,1

There are two books before Blood of Elves: The Last Wish, and the Sword of Destiny. Both are semi-connected short story collections which set up the events for books 3-7, which are one long story. You should read both of them, since they are the best books in the series. You don't need to read them chronologically, but you really should, since you will miss out on a lot of funny moments, character introductions, and the main ""a-ha"" twist at the end of the entire series if you skip the short stories. Just read them.

Recommended reading order:

1. The Last Wish
2. Sword of Destiny
3. Blood of Elves
4. Time of Contempt
5. Baptism of Fire
6. Tower of the Swallow (fan translation only)
7. Lady of the Lake (fan translation only)

The fan translations read exactly like the official English releases, minus some spelling/grammar errors (more in book 7 than book 6), and can be found over at /r/thewitcher. ",theadamvine,2015-09-11T09:57:45Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,2
3ki7p1_3,3ki7p1,"No, go ahead with BoE. IIRC, there's just one short story from The Last Wish set in Cintra explaining Ciri's mother's history which you can probably read online. The rest of the short stories in the book are deconstructions of popular fairy tales. 

Happy reading, you're in for a helluva good time with the Witcher series.",Magodo,2015-09-11T06:23:36Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,3
3ki7p1_4,3ki7p1,The Last Wish is just a collection of short stories that have Geralt as the main character. I started with Blood of Elves and just recently read The Last Wish and I don't think you'll miss anything.,,2015-09-11T06:24:24Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,4
3ki7p1_5,3ki7p1,"I forgot to read the Sword of Destiny until I read every other book in the series and played all the games. You might pull your hair out with frustration to do it in that order. Pretty rare for me to lose sleep over a book out of frustration but reading this book last did it for me. That said, I might even read it in that order if I had to do it all over again TBH. 

The Last Wish isn't so bad to read out of order.",toofine,2015-09-11T09:03:26Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,5
3ki7p1_6,3ki7p1,"The last wish is to the Witcher series what the Hobbit is to Lord of the Rings.

Quite a few characters carry through, and it marks the first appearances of many characters from the games and books, but all in all there is no need to have read it.

That said, I really, really liked the short stories. It is WELL worth the read, but you can get to it anytime. I found it easier to digest than the denser story of BoE.",,2015-09-11T15:24:31Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,6

3ki7p1_9,3ki7p1,"Was there any reason they were relased in this order in English?

People here give good advice to read them chronologically, which means: The Last Wish, Sword of Destiny, and then the main Saga.

However it's not a major issue if you read Sword of Destiny later, whatever will be most fun for you.",BruceWayneShepard,2015-09-16T14:34:09Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,9
3ki7p1_10,3ki7p1,"Right, but since you already know Dandelion, Zoltan, Triss, Sabrina from the games, you're set for the books. The Last Wish is still worth reading. But if you're in a hurry, you can start BoE.",Magodo,2015-09-11T08:44:10Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,10

ewap1n_1,ewap1n,"I really liked The Last Wish, but it does have a different feel to the writing - maybe because it's been translated or because it's a series of short stories spliced together into a novel. There's more distance between reader and Geralt, but I think that's on purpose because he's supposed to be that kind of character - sort of mysterious and cold on the outside and it doesn't get too deep into his feelings. As the series goes on, you get to know him better.",serralinda73,2020-01-30T20:00:11Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,1
leg6c2_1,leg6c2,"Sadly I've yet to come across anything that captures the vibe of The Last Wish in the way that I'd like. I've found its vibe to be unfortunately kind of unique. After Sword of Destiny even the Witcher series changes a fair bit (morphs into epic fantasy). One thought is that you might want to try some old school sword & sorcery like Elric of Melbinone, Conan etc. Part of me also wonders if you'd be into something like The Curse of Chalion by Lois McMaster Bujold. It's not a very long book, is single pov involving curses/demons in a medieval setting, although not s&s or about a monster hunter. 

As far as the Witcher series itself, for me it was a mixed bag. I loved The Last Wish and Baptism of Fire because they were the most Geralt heavy. I loved Geralt as a character and wished more of the series had actually focused on him. Most of the other books were 3.5-4 star vicinity for me, although I wasn't a fan of the last book Lady of the Lake.",D3athRider,2021-02-07T06:02:01Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,1

ejxbbo_1,ejxbbo,"I just started The Last Wish two days ago and I’m in love! Not at first though... the narrator (on audible drove me nuts but I ended up liking him about 2 hrs into it. And, I was seriously confused at how it was arranged, but I saw an interview with the book author and the tv show runner where the author talked about how no one would buy the story so he made several short stories and the found a way to combine it all. 

So there’s 1 book (The Voice of Reason chapters) and several short stories bracketing them. You can almost think of them as flashbacks bc they’re all different events which lead Geralt to where he is. Now, I think it’s a fascinating way to give you just enough of the world and the characters to want to know more, but not so much you’re thinking yea yea yea ... skiiiip. 

It’s also the first book in the omniscient viewpoint I’ve both read and liked in a while. I think we’re all so used to 3rd person and 1st person these days that it can throw some for a loop.",IneptSage,2020-01-04T19:07:34Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,1
ejxbbo_2,ejxbbo,"I've been wanting to give the books another shot. I read about half of The Last Wish. It felt disjointed. I didn't know going into it that it would be short stories. I've never been a fantasy reader and the lack of a centralized story threw me off.

It's a shame that Sword of Destiny wasn't officially translated and released in English because it introduces some important characters. The fan translation is pretty good though.",i_am_only_an_egg,2013-06-25T01:07:22Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,1
1gka9l_2,1gka9l,"I would highly recommend the two short story collections. I'm only just starting Blood of Elves myself, but a lot of the big characters (Dandilion, Ciri, Yennefer, etc) are introduced and fleshed out in the short stories so you're missing out on a lot of back story.

The Last Wish is consistently awesome throughout but I found the last two stories in The Sword of Destiny to be much better and more important than the four that preceded it.",i_am_only_an_egg,2013-06-28T04:56:32Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,2
2ukvih_1,2ukvih,"They're really really really really not video game related. The first game came later, by at least 10 years. The game series has 'flavoured' the marketing of the earlier books (and the US releases), but it hasn't had much of an effect except arguably be the catalyst for the UK releases (The Last Wish released roughly alongside The Witcher 1).

The translations aren't perfect, they're certainly not on the level of, say, a Murakami novel, but they're pretty readable. I haven't yet read the most recent translation (Baptism of Fire) through to completion, but it's pretty typical of the series. 

It's worth noting that the actual second book, Sword of Destiny, is due for release (at least in the UK) in May, with the rest of the series (except the latest book, the translation of which is yet to be confirmed IIRC) to follow in time. It was skipped for some reason but one or two of the stories are important as they lead into the novel series.

Oh, I didn't explain. The Witcher series is two anthologies and then a series of books. The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny come first, and they're collections of shorter works, and then the series starts properly with Blood of Elves.",,2015-02-03T08:56:40Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Last Wish,1
