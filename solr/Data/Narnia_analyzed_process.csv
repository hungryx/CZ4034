ercxjc_1,ercxjc,"I am 44 and read them all in intended (not chronological by year published) and ""enjoyed"" them. They were a fun, fairly quick read - probably about the same time it would take me to get through Fellowship of the Ring and maybe half of The Two Towers.

This is where I drop the ""but"": I wish I read these books when I was in my early teens. When I read through the Tales of Prydain. After Prydain I discovered Stephen King and (shudder) Clive Cussler. I didn't wind-up reading LoTR until I was in college and, even then, wish I had read THOSE books sooner, too.

Personally, I prefer Tolkein to Lewis but, like I said, I read them first in college and - as an English Lit major - there is SO much depth that LoTR keeps me coming back over and over again. Maybe I was looking too hard for the same thing in the Chronicles of Narnia.

Maybe 40-something is a bit too old but, for all of that, the books did engross me. The story and settings kept me immersed. And, after it all, I went back and re-watched the ""original"" cartoon of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (from 1979) with my daughters.",huxley75,2020-01-20T19:53:25Z,1,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,1

I enjoyed the first 3 books (The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, & Voyage of the Dawn Treader).  However, after that the series kinda fell apart for me.  I read them all, but I don't see myself likely to re-read any but the first 3.  & as for the religious references, they only started to bother me in the last book (The Last Battle) & that's because Lewis is basically beating the reader over the head w/ the references there.",DBRY98,2020-01-21T16:24:53Z,2,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,3

ercxjc_5,ercxjc,"I enjoy the Chronicles of Narnia, but in a similar vein (but more adult, definitely) is the His Dark Materials series, by Phillip Pullman. It has a similar ""otherworldly"" aspect to it, while also plunging further into that, as well as much deeper themes and darker moments, all without the ""childishness"" that seems to peep through Chronicles of Narnia's writing.

There are also religious themes, but rather than being about the substance of the religion itself, it's more about the practice and commentary on organized religion. However, I think it's better incorporated into the story, and is less prominent than in Narnia. 

The first book is the Golden Compass, or Northern Lights in the UK, and it recently got made into an HBO series.",Goyf4Prez2020,2020-01-21T03:25:21Z,1,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,5

ercxjc_8,ercxjc,"Once you read them pick up The Magicians books by Lev Grossman, which are a reimagining of The Chronicles of Narnia as a present day sequel through modern eyes, written for adults. Narnia is transparently known as Fillory in these books, and the main characters are essentially responding to The Chronicles of Narnia as historical text in the context of magic being real and underground in our world, requiring people to go to college to learn it. (So there's an element of responding to Harry Potter here too.)

The TV series based upon The  Magicians books is also one of the few book to series adaptations which is even better than the books.

ercxjc_12,ercxjc,"Lewis' theology in the Chronicles of Narnia can be incredibly heavy-handed, it's basically fantasy Gospels for kids.  And his grasp of theology is certainly quite flawed, especially since he once lost a formal debate with a woman (""A **learned** woman?  in the 1940s?  good gracious!"") over the subject.  According to some of his associates, the event was so humiliating that Lewis chose to shift his focus towards evangelizing through children's literature instead, which is how the Chronicles of Narnia was born.

It's still a fun ride, though.  If you're in it for the fun adventure, go ahead.  Don't let anyone tell you it's too immature for you, just don't take the messaging too seriously.

xtebta_3,xtebta,"Hey was definitely just  trying to avoid losing rank in the literary community. The most famous allegory at the time was Pilgrim’s Progress, and it was disgustingly simple, preachy, and patronizing. I know this because it used to be one of my favorite books as a young Christian, and most early 20th century Christians were raised on it as a collection of moral fables. Yet another forceful extension of Christian inculcation. I love the Chronicles of Narnia, but there’s no denying C.S. Lewis was very preachy in it. His concern about its reception makes sense as he achieved a higher level of fame when he started debating atheists and pandering to the Christian community, which risked him losing status among his peers during the scientific revolution. He was doubtlessly influenced by Pilgrim’s Progress himself. His literary idol was George MacDonald whose family performed plays inspired by it, and Lewis himself went on to write Pilgrim’s Regress, a very direct and intentional allegory explicitly alluding to Pilgrim’s Progress. Lewis was trying to save Chronicles from the same death that was already arriving for Pilgrim’s Progress, and he partially succeeded I think. Mere Christianity is a ever-weakening attempt to bolster 1st Century stories and is already mostly forgotten, but some of his fiction will probably stand the test of time because he was more faithful in it to his expertise in literary mythos which typically departs more or less from prosaic moralizing.",Hailifiknow,2022-10-02T14:28:59Z,2,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,3

xtebta_7,xtebta,"That Aslan is Jesus even Lewis does not deny.

That the Chronicles of Narnia are an allegory he does, and that is because as a series, it is not an allegory.

Certainly you are right that the death and resurrection scenes are parallel to Christ's own: But no one in Narnia is saved because of that, except for Edmund, and it is not mentioned again nor is it a requirement for following Aslan. It's simply in the nature of Christ to die for one in need, in their place, even when they are guilty, and that is simply in the one book. It is a ""What if Jesus were a lion in another world"" story more than the series itself is an allegory.

So I could agree with you that Aslan himself is an allegorical figure for Christ. But that the Chronicles of Narnia is an allegory? No.",FergusCragson,2022-10-02T09:15:05Z,2,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,7

Narnia has an oddly rapid and magical connection to Earth that centers not only around Aslan, but also the Pevensies and the people closest to them. Digory Kirk's ""magician"" of an uncle is a madman to have discovered and harnessed the powers that transport us from world to world.

6ax8r9_1,6ax8r9,"Whole-hearted agreement.  The Chronicles of Narnia might be the only series I have read more than twice.  Every. Single. Time.  I become enamored with the world, the characters and the story.  To this day when I picture the end of all things and the transition I picture the running through fields of green and over hills without tiredness or fatigue.  Freedom and Joy.  I only get sad because the stories are over.  But they'll be there again when I re-read them in a few years.  

P.S. I recommend to others the original reading/written order: Leaving the Magician's Nephew as the 2nd to last book, and not reading it ""chronologically correct"" as the 1st book.  The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is very much meant to be the first book.  Edit in: The stories mostly stand on their own, and so it's not a necessity to read them in *any* specific order.  I like the order in which I originally read them.  If you haven't read them, they're pretty straight forward easy reads, but in a timeless way.

So I saved my pocket money and bought three of the others through the school book club, leaving only one to collect. Then when I was twelve I won a drawing competition at school and as the teacher knew I was missing one more book, he got me a hard cover of The Last Battle as the prize. I was so happy!

Those books, three still charred, three book club soft covers, and one hard cover are safely tucked in the cupboard to this day.

But it definitely is weird reading them now - so many things that wooshed right by me as a kid.

6ax8r9_3,6ax8r9,"The Chronicles of Narnia are some of my all time favorite books. When I was very young and still learning how to read, my mom read the LWW to me and my brothers, and I listened to the [Focus on the Family Radio Theatre](http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Battle_(Focus_of_the_Family_Radio_Theatre)) version millions of times. I can still remember many of the quotes word for word in the various actor's voices. It really fed my desire to learn how to read and understand the world around me, seen or unseen.

When I got older I read the books, and it sparked my appetite for books and reading for the rest of my life. Once in a while, I'll reread them and notice things that resonate within me in a way they hadn't before or just appreciate how lyrical and smooth Lewis's storytelling is even years later. CS Lewis has a way of putting complex concepts and thoughts into words in a way that easy to understand, yet completely summarizes everything that it is in within the boundary of a few words.

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is my favorite book of the series as it has the atmosphere of adventure and mystery while simultaneously giving the melancholy feeling of reading both an ending and a beginning. Reepicheep's final goodbye and journey into Aslan's Country gets me right in the feels every time I read it. 

The Horse and His Boy is my second favorite as I was an avid horse lover when I was younger, but also because I loved that it how it was the perfect story with a good ending. ",SassySesi,2017-05-13T22:11:56Z,1,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,3

As some have said, Lewis was a better academic than he was a writer, but in his writing I find incredible ideas and images, and it's in these settings and possibilities that I love to go back to again and again.  The Magician's Nephew is a lovely creation-story, but it's not my favorite overall, which is probably the Horse and His Boy.  As for the Dawn Treader, I love that because of the characters we meet--specifically the final character, the star who was banished to Narnia for misdeeds and must grow younger everyday by eating berries picked from the high mountains.  And who can forget Reepicheep, one of my favorite characters in all the series?

Just remember, these were written a long time ago.  They were ground-breaking then, and the fact that so many still cherish these stories goes to show that there are many universal ideas presented in a boiled-down way that resonates with a lot of people.

kuobvs_1,kuobvs,"I remember reading ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" in fourth grade, but I hadn't read any of the others. When I was moving into a new apartment mid December I found a collection of the Chronicles of Narnia in one of the boxes that I had forgotten about and read through one of the books every evening instead of surfing the web. They were nice. My grandfather passed away this past year so I won't deny crying when a certain character appeared at the end of the final book.",Sivy17,2021-01-11T14:44:08Z,1,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,1

10k8anm_1,10k8anm,"Pre-Christianity on the British Isles included a Celtic otherworld of eternal youth, beauty and joy. It was called Tír na nÓg in Ireland, Annwn in Wales and Avalon in England. So when Christianity, which has its own promised afterlife, was brought to the islands, it cleaved to the ideas and concepts that already existed.

A lot of these stories you mentioned draw very heavily on Celtic traditions specifically, with the authors (like Tolkien and Lewis) Christianity also playing a very heavy role. The Chronicles of Narnia are barely concealed Biblical allegory.",,2023-01-24T16:59:53Z,2,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,1

However, there are some staple books that I find myself returning to time and time again, such as Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and the Chronicles of Narnia.

f27002_1,f27002,"In no particular order:

* The Chronicles of Prydain - The series that introduced me to High Fantasy. And until this day, I maintain, has one of the best coming of age stories written. Fantasy is still by far my favorite genre.

* Harry Potter - I grew up on Harry Potter like most 90s kids. At the time like a lot of them, I was obsessed about it. This got me into collecting memorabilia and buying multiple editions of the same book because of the cover. 

* The Chronicles of Narnia - The Horse and His Boy was my favorite title from the series. It didn't really age well. And I felt that the allusions to religion and Christianity got really in your face as the story was ending. I didn't really know it then, but maybe those were already signs pointing towards me being Agnostic.

* Shadow Children - As a kid, I thought this was a pretty dark story. Whereas I was used to knights, monsters and triumphing over evil, this was the most grounded book series I read at the time. Even in the first book, the event near the end was pretty shocking to me. I may not be a ride or die activist but I'm pretty outspoken about topics to push for equality and acceptance. 

* The Count of Monte Cristo - The very first book I ever read by myself. This was the book that started my love affair with reading. I was 9 and confined to bed rest after a head injury with nothing much to do. This book kept me company. 

+Bonus: As an adult -

* Mistborn Trilogy - my first foray into adult fantasy and introduced me to hard magic systems which I adore. Rediscovered my love of reading after several years of being in a rut.",kaysn,2020-02-11T12:32:23Z,1,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,1
am6g7v_1,am6g7v,"I don't know about the antithesis of The Chronicles of Narnia, but that is an interesting way of looking at it. But I do know that the author, Phillip Pullman, is a huge fan of Milton's Paradise Lost, and that was part of the inspiration of his writing the His Dark Materials trilogy.  I enjoyed the books. It's basically a coming of age story, with some religious references, but nothing that strong, more of a certain type of cultural point.

Just so you know, there is a new trilogy that he is working on set in this world that touches on this one. There are also some other shorter works in the world.

There is also an older movie based on the story, staring Nicole Kidman, that was so so. ",kimiller83,2019-02-02T15:37:50Z,1,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,1

The Chronicles of Narnia have some weak spots, but generally, is a wonderful fantasy series and Christian allegory.  The Screwtape Letters are pretty funny, too.  Man can write is what it comes down to.",,2012-08-23T16:34:33Z,2,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,1

8ll95e_1,8ll95e,"I think my favourite book in The Chronicles of Narnia is either Prince Caspian or The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Prince Caspian is (arguably) a lot more interesting because of the realpolitik aspects and that the Telmarines were basically just like the Pevensies in that they came to Narnia and stayed. However... The Telmarines decided that it'd be better to try and dominate pre-existing being in Narnia as opposed to working with them.

I don't really like The Last Battle because of the ending. Long story.",HappyMike91,2018-05-23T20:18:23Z,2,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,1
8ll95e_2,8ll95e,"The Magician's Nephew and The Horse and His Boy each have unique flavors from the rest of the series. There's something so infinite about The Magician's Nephew, I always tried to imagine the various worlds beyond the doors. I have memories of reading The Horse and His Boy in a stable while waiting for my sister to be done with her horseback riding lessons.

I see TLTW&TW, Prince Caspian, and Dawn Treader as the meat of the series; they're very actiony with the strongest sense of continuity among them. Dawn Treader, being the 3rd written, makes the transition to exploring the edges of Lewis's world literally and figuratively. I was fascinated by this aspect and especially invested in Reepicheep. I'm glad that Silver Chair is getting a lot of love in this thread, it's one of my favorites. Puddleglum is a great character, and I liked seeing Eustace's character development.

The Last Battle is for me, like many others, the least favorite. Lewis gave in to his worst instincts with the apocalyptic themes here.

I think, looking back, that the Chronicles of Narnia cultivates a sense of transience and nostalgia. Lewis shows us moments of great beauty and great horror, then snatches them away. He taps into the fear of growing up, and he hints at mysteries never solved and tales never told. It makes Narnia feel so much bigger and more alive than what is actually revealed to us.",,2018-05-24T13:59:10Z,1,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,2

It's been years since I read the Chronicles of Narnia (I'm definitely due for a re-read), but I am certain it would have been a very different and less enchanting experience to first read the books in Narnian chronological order. The way that world unfolds in publication order is magical and mysterious. My brother had the box set growing up and so I was never given one. When I finally bought one for myself, I had to find a used one on Ebay because I was so frustrated with new editions being reordered. ",con_moto,2018-08-19T16:39:36Z,1,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,1
463mef_1,463mef,"For the longest time, literary scholars wondered why CS Lewis wrote the Chronicles of Narnia in the manner in which he did and knew there was an underlying theme.  Fifty years later, author Michael Ward, working on the expanse of Lewis literature has a brain storm that the Chronicles of Narnia have an underlying allegory of planetary symbolism within medieval cosmology.  He wrote a book about his research titled *Planet Narnia :The Seven Heavens In The Imagination Of CS Lewis*. ",,2016-02-16T20:56:02Z,2,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,Narnia,1
