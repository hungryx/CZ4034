10y8b19_1,10y8b19,"When I was 10 years old, my 4th grade teacher began reading our class the Princess Bride each day, one chapter at a time. 

I loved it so much, I started sneaking back into our classroom every day during recess so I could read ahead. 

When she finally caught me, my teacher said I could take it home and finish it over the weekend, just so long as I didn’t spoil any of it for the class!

That was 25 years ago. 

It is still my favorite book of all time, and I can’t wait to share it with my own children.",Equal_Position7219,2023-02-10T05:34:35Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,1
10y8b19_2,10y8b19,"Once Upon a Time someone (it might be me) had two copies of The Princess Bride on their bookshelf. They had no idea how the books got there but they often went to library sales and thrift shops and grabbed boxes of books. 

They were a bit of a Science Fiction nerd, and didn't like fantasy at all. A book with ""princess"" in the title had to be fantasy, right? So the book sat there, year after year, passed over for other books. 

One day, we may never know how it happened, but the Princess Bride wound up in the hands of the SF reader. And within one sentence, they knew it would be one of their favorite books, ever.

I started reading lots of books to my kids before watching the movie, like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda and such. I started in on The Princess Bride, and all the stuff about him working in Hollywood and nearly cheating on his wife with a starlet just baffled my 8 year old, and me. ""No, I'm serious,"" I said. ""This is a good book."" And I had to skip to the book-within-a-book part to make it good for him.

10y8b19_8,10y8b19,"I think it's a testament to what a great, canny, writer Goldman was. Books and movies make different demands of writers and audiences. Successfully adapting a book into a movie requires real finesse. 

This is a perfect example. This scene is hilarious but it would feel overwrought in a movie. Awkward, too long, detracting from the flow. It's easy to imagine the exchange but hard to imagine even great actors delivering it without sounding clunky. 

I always felt you could build a whole class just around the Princess Bride and how masterfully Goldman streamlined it, adapting a great book into a great movie. In a sense, the movie is the good parts version of the good parts version of Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure. 

But that's just fun to say.  They both take every advantage of their form.  The movie doesn't feel weighed down by devotion to the source (check out Roger Ebert's review of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Movies. And, for my money, most of the Harry Potter films failed to capture the spirit of the books because they tried so hard to just film the books methodically scene for scene). And, of course, the book is really a book; it doesn't feel like the author wanted to make a movie but didn't have the means.  I've read a few books like that; they feel like the author was just publishing a story synopsis so they could sell the film rights. 

Anyway, I love them both for their unique and medium specific merits.",,2023-02-10T01:43:48Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,8

10y8b19_11,10y8b19,"The movie or the book?  I mean, the answer is basically the same in either case, just with a slight alteration.

Big picture, it's a story that both pokes fun at, and relishes the trappings of swashbuckling adventures.  It's a parody that feels like it genuinely loves the subject it's parodying.  I guess the best comparison I can make is the way Tarantino makes movies that are clearly inspired by and tribute to spaghetti westerns and asian cinema, and in the process creates something that's like a heightened dream version of those stories, only *The Princess Bride* is doing the same thing for stories that are more whimsical and optimistic.  The book is a *little* more cynical and the movie a *little* more sweet.

In the more small-scale side of it, the characters are fantastic broad-strokes types with just enough nuance to make them feel alive within their type.  The dialogue is masterful.  Speaking of the movie specifically, I don't know if I've ever seen dialogue done better, in that it can be both *really* clever in turn-of-phrase, while still being completely accessible and just as fun for a child.",sdwoodchuck,2023-02-10T08:46:53Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,11

10y8b19_15,10y8b19,"Marvel was the example he gave. I fucking love the Marvel movies but you are of course correct, they aren’t the same caliber of film as The Princess Bride. So let’s compare two films that are. In the last year, we’ve had two: Everything Everywhere All At Once and Weird: The Al Yankovic story. Those two films could go toe-to-toe with TPB or any other comedic action movie from any decade. 

Film is in a genuine renaissance. In horror we have received masterpieces like Midsommar. We got Dune in the epic science fiction category. Even Marvel films compare favorably to the ultra-cheesey superhero films of decades past. Only Tim Burton’s Batman is in the same league.

Without them, it’s a heartwarming satirical adventure story. With them, it is also about how the things you read as a child shape who you’re gonna be—stories move us and change us. Sure, the fictionalized Goldman is a jerk, but the parts of him that are good are largely due to someone reading to him as a kid and opening that door to loving True Love and High Adventure. He might be bitter and cynical now, but he believed in that once, and wants others to believe the same even though he himself has lost faith. An entire adult life of bitter cynicism isn’t enough to undo the fact that the story of The Princess Bride is rooted deeply inside him and part of who he is.",IndytheIntrepid,2021-07-14T13:27:45Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,1
ok1x4u_2,ok1x4u,"I love just how long they kept up the ruse for the “reunion scene.” It used to be you had to write in for it, and they’d send you a letter about the new advancements in the legal battle. They literally kept it up for decades, even after they switched to an email format. In case anyone is curious for an additional read:

> Dear Reader,

> Thank you for sending in and no, this is not the reunion scene, because of a certain roadblock named Kermit Shog.

> As soon as bound books were ready, I got a call from my lawyer, Charley--(you may not remember, but Charley's the one I called from California to go down in the blizzard and buy _The Princess Bride_ from the used-book dealer). Anyway, he usually begins with Talmudic humor, wisdom jokes, only this time he just says ""Bill, I think you better get down here,"" and before I'm even allowed to say a 'why?' he adds, ""Right away if you can.""

> Panicked, I zoom down, wondering who could have died, did I flunk my tax audit, what? His secretary lets me into his office and Charley says, ""This is Mr. Shog, Bill.""

> And there he is, sitting in the corner, hands on his briefcase, looking exactly like an oily version of Peter Lorre. I really expected him to say, ""Give me the Falcon, you must, or I'll be forced to keeel you.""

> ""Mr. Shog is a lawyer,"" Charley goes on. And this next was said underlined: _""He represents the Morgenstern estate.""_

> Who knew? Who could have dreamed such a thing existed, an estate of a man dead at least a million years that no one ever heard of over here anyway? ""Perhaps you will give me the Falcon now,"" Mr. Shog said. That's not true. What he said was, ""Perhaps you will like a few words with your client alone now,"" and Charley nodded and out he went and once he was gone I said, ""Charley, my God, I never figured--"" and he said, ""Did Harcourt?"" and I said, ""Not that they ever mentioned"" and he said, ""Ooch,"" the grunting sound lawyers make when they know they've backed a loser. ""What does he want?"" I said. ""A meeting with Mr. Jovanovich,"" Charley answered.

> Now, William Jovanovich is a pretty busy fella, but it's amazing when you're confronted with a potential multibillion-dollar lawsuit how fast you can wedge in a meeting. We trooped over.

> All the Harcourt Brass was there, I'm there, Charley; Mr. Shog, who would sweat in an igloo he's so swarthy, is streaming. Harcourt's lawyer started things: ""We're terribly terribly sorry, Mr. Shog. It's an unforgivable oversight, and please accept our sincerest apologies."" Mr. Shog said, ""That's a beginning, since all you did was defame and ridicule the greatest modern master of Florinese prose who also happened to be for many years a friend of my family.""  Then the business head of Harcourt said, ""All right, how much do you want?""

> Biiiig mistake. _""Money?""_ Mr. Shog cried. ""You think this is petty blackmail that brings us together? _Resurrection_ is the issue, sir. Morgenstern must be undefiled. You will publish the original version."" And now a look at me. ""In the _unabridged_ form.""

> I said, ""I'm done with it, I swear. True, there's just the reunion scene business we printed up, but there's not liable to be a rush on that, so it's all past as far as I'm concerned."" But Mr. Shog wasn't done with me: ""_You,_ who _dared_ to _defame_ a master's characters are now going to put your words in their mouths? Nossir. No, I say."" ""It's just a little thing,"" I tried; ""a couple pages only.""

> Then Mr. Jovanovich started talking softly. ""Bill, I think we might skip sending out the reunion scene just now, don't you think?"" I made a nod. Then he turned to Mr. Shog. ""We'll print the unabridged. You're a man who is interested in immortality for his client, and there aren't as many of you around in publishing as there used to be. You're a gentleman, sir.""  ""Thank you,"" from Mr. Shog; ""I like to think I am, at least on occasion."" For the first time, he smiled. We all smiled. Very buddy-buddy now. Then, an addendum from Mr. Shog: ""Oh, yes. Your first printing of the unabridged will be 100,000 copies.""

> * * * *

> So far, there are thirteen lawsuits, only eleven involving me directly. Charley promises nothing will come to court and that eventually Harcourt will publish the unabridged. But legal maneuvering takes time. The copyright on Morgenstern runs out in early '78, and all of you who wrote in are having your names put alphabetically on computer, so whichever happens first, the settlement or the year, you'll get your copy.

> The last I was told, Kermit Shog was willing to come down on his first printing provided Harcourt agreed to publish the sequel to _The Princess Bride,_ which hasn't been translated into English yet, much less published here. The title of the sequel is: _Buttercup's Baby: S. Morgenstern's Glorious Examination of Courage Matched Against the Death of the Heart._

> I'd never heard of it, naturally, but there's a Ph.D. candidate in Florinese Lit up at Columbia who's going through it now. I'm kind of interested in what he has to say.

> --William Goldman

> P.S.

> I'm really sorry about this, but you know the story that ends, ""disregard previous wire, letter follows?"" Well, you've got to disregard the business about the Morgenstern copyright running out in '78. That was a definite boo-boo but Mr. Shog, being Florinese, has trouble, naturally, with our numbering system. The copyright runs out in '87, not '78.

> Worse, he died. Mr. Shog I mean. (Don't ask how could you tell. It was easy. One morning he just stopped sweating, so there it was.) What makes it worse is that the whole affair is now in the hands of his kid, named--wait for it--Mandrake Shog. Mandrake moves with all the verve and speed of a lizard flaked out on a riverbank.

> The only good thing that's happened in this whole mess is I finally got a shot at reading _Buttercup's Baby._ Up at Columbia they feel it's definitely superior to _The Princess Bride_ in satirical content. Personally, I don't have the emotional attachment to it, but it's a helluva story, no question.

> Give it a look-see when you have a chance.

> --August, 1978

> P.P.S.

> This is getting humiliating. Have you been reading in the papers about the trade problems America is having with Japan? Well, maddening as this may be, since it reflects on the reunion scene, we're also having trade problems with Florin, which, it turns out, is our leading supplier of Cadminium, which, it also turns out, NASA is panting for.

> So all Florinese-American litigation, which includes the thirteen law suits, has officially been put on hold.

> What this means is that the reunion scene, for now, is caught between our need for Cadminium and diplomatic relations between the two countries.

> But at least the movie got made. Mandrake Shog was shown it, and word reached me he even smiled once or twice. Hope springs eternal.

> --May, 1987

ok1x4u_5,ok1x4u,"I like the book, but actually think The Princess Bride is an example of the movie being better than the book. The issue for me is the contrasting framing devices used. In the book it's what you mentioned, the author occasionally breaking the 4th wall to point out how much better his version of the story is compared to the fictional uncut version he is adapting from. It's a gag that gets old during your first read of the book and just seems to get in the way during subsequent reads. 

Contrast that to the movie, where the framing device is a kindly grandfather reading the story to his sick grandson. It is an endearing addition to an already wonderful story that holds up well no matter how many times you see the movie.",Greypilgram,2021-07-14T15:35:05Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,5

I never considered that it was based on a real book - I thought it was just a grandpa reading a fictional book to his sick grandkid. I wouldn't have been surprised to find out that a book based on the fictional book in the movie came \*after\* the movie's success.

But, I was also born way before the book - and the first time I ever heard of it was when the movie came out - which at the time - a children's fairy-tale book like this would have been known WELL before the book if that was the order it came in.

I wonder how many people who believe it is the other way - came to be AFTER the movie.  


Just realized this is Rob Reiner and there is a Spinal Tap tie-in to all of this.   


Interestingly, I had a metalhead friend who absolutely believed that Spinal Tap was a real band in the 80s when we were 14 or 15... and it took me a lot of effort to convince him, as a punk - that it wasn't a real band, a real album, or real rock-stars.

*The Princess Bride* is a very meta satirical novel. It is not purely about being a light-hearted fantasy adventure story. It’s about how we, as adults, remember the stories that stuck with us as children. Goldman-the-narrator (because he’s also a made-up character) is a cynical adult who is unhappy despite the fact that he, on paper, has everything he wants. He finds that he desperately wants to reconstruct this fantasy story that his father told him as a child, and is horrified to find that the story itself was a reconstruction. So he desperately tries to re-reconstruct it for you, the reader. This leads to the darkest, funniest, and deepest parts of the entire book.

So you *can* enjoy it purely as a light hearted fantasy adventure, but if you are, you are enjoying it on a much more shallow level than it is intended to be enjoyed.",MaichenM,2021-07-14T14:26:47Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,13

http://www.rukkola.hu/konyvek/24086-the_princess_bride

So many questions- why is she naked?  Why does she have a bird on her head?  Why does she have tentacle-snake legs which seem to be raping her?  

And WHO IS SHE since there's NOTHING LIKE THIS in the book?

Here's the mind-blowing part which takes a minute to really grasp:

The whole ""S. Morgenstern's *The Princess Bride* book"" in the extensive preface?  It's fiction.  Not that he's remaking a fictional, twisted remake of a book of fiction.  That's not it.  Go deeper...

There was never any author by that name, no book by the name of *The Princess Bride* existed before William Goldman's book, and no book or fairy tale significantly resembled what Goldman described.  Goldman made up the part about recalling this book from his childhood.

The whole chapter-long preface and ongoing annotations about the story ARE part of the story.  He didn't just give an autobiographical account of his making up a remake of a story, he made a story about making a remake of a thing which is also made-up.

Goldman wrote the screenplay too, which couldn't convey that element well.  It would be a boring-as-fuck opening 15 min if it were onscreen.

4e46v0_4,4e46v0,"My favorite film of all time 

(And I'm a filmmaker and devout film lover so I do not give that title out lightly)

I first saw it when I was a little boy and it was one of the movies that made me fall in love with movies. 
I've watched it more times than I can count and it's one of the few, if not only, movies I could quote every single word of every single scene.

The book is amazing too. I think it's a damn shame the ""sequel"" never got finished. The copy of the book I bought came with a few pages of the unfinished sequel  ""buttercups baby""

Ps: speaking of which, for years I bought Goldman's plot device/ruse that the princess bride was an abridged version of a much older story; it turns out that was all just a lie and basically just a plot device (like when Tolkein claimed the lord of the rings was just a translation of a story he found)

In reality Goldman wrote the whole thing himself

oo8ffv_3,oo8ffv,"I tried to like the book, but I just couldn't. I hated the book Goldman, I hated Westley and Buttercup. I liked the idea of the translated old masterpiece in theory, but in practice it got annoying pretty fast. Parts were fun, I mostly enjoyed Inigo and Fezzik's sections. But it was a chore to finish the book, full of flat unlikable characters from a flat unlikable framing story. It didn't lead me to think critically about the genre, it led me to just hate the book. 

I'm not at all against satire that pokes at the fairytale/fantasy tropes and I don't think main characters all need to be likable. The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle is an excellent example of a book that satirizes the genre while still respecting the good parts about it and still being nice to read.

The book contains an autobiographical frame story about the author, William Goldman. He talks about how his father, who was an immigrant from Florin, used to read him his favorite book when he was a kid: ""The Princess Bride"", by S. Morgenstern. Now a father himself, Goldman wants to find a copy of this book to read to his own kid. 

He finally tracks down an English translation, only to discover it's basically a very dense, very dull history book and not at all what he remembers. He realizes his father left out the boring stuff and only read ""the good parts"". So Goldman decides that's the story he wants to pass along to his kid.

The full title of William Goldman's book is ""The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure (The ""Good Parts"" Version)"". It's an abridgement of the original Florinese classic, plus the frame story.

... only that's all made up. There is no such place as Florin. There is no S. Morgenstern. There is no original version of ""The Princess Bride"". The book really makes you believe Goldman's backstory (he supplements the lie with a lot of details from his real life), but it's all fiction.

akoxx9_2,akoxx9,"Here's my take. I agree with what a few other people pointed out, that it manages to skewer fantasy tropes while also telling a great fantasy story. But what makes it truly great has nothing to do with genre. It's that Goldman just put so goddamn much into the story. Inigo isn't just a great swordsman; he's a great swordsman who's an obstacle for our hero, he's got a tragic, sympathetic history that is itself a great story. Westley isn't just kidnapped by the Dread Pirate Roberts, he takes over from Roberts in a clever twist that is itself a great story.

The whole book/movie is a story that's *full of other great stories*, and there's so much specificity to all of it. Why is the guy in the Pit of Despair an albino? Why is the bishop such a hilariously bad public speaker? Why did Vizzini find Fezzig unemployed in Greenland of all places? It's because Goldman thought through every single detail in the story, and packed it with as much incident and color as he possibly could.

There are so many inventive details. The Cliffs of Insanity. The Fire Swamps. The Six-Fingered Man. The Machine. 

And then, of course, the dialogue. Has there ever been a more quotable movie? A few years ago I was on a road trip with my kids, but not my wife. So it was left to me to entertain them, and I downloaded an audio book and it wouldn't play. So we had a 7-hour drive ahead of us with nothing to do. So I recounted the entire story of The Princess Bride, and found I could recite virtually the whole movie from memory. (Buttercup's about the only one in the film who doesn't say something immediately memorable every time she opens her mouth)

It's like that story about the college professor filling a jar with golf balls and asking if it was full. And then when the class said yes, filling the space in between with ball bearings. And then filling the space in between those with sand. And then pouring a beer into the sand. There's always room for more, and Goldman didn't stop with his story until he had filled it to the top four times over.

tl;dr: Goldman packs ever square inch of his story with something memorable.",mikevago,2019-01-28T19:43:33Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,2

akoxx9_4,akoxx9,"Wait... the book and movie aren't similar at all! I love both, but they're so different. 

The book is a satire of a satire- Goldman makes fun of a fake book by S Morgenstern which in itself is written as a satire of the typical ""princess story."" To me, it's like the inverse of the typical heroic story- usually the main characters are fleshed out and meet one-dimensional villains, but in The Princess Bride the main characters are relatively one-dimensional (Buttercup is super ditzy and annoying, Westley is just Mr Perfect) and it's the side characters who are fleshed out. And a MAJOR part of the rest of the story is Goldman's narration. He sometimes lays it on a bit thick, but overall he does a really good job making it seem like he's taking a relatively lame hero story and turning it into something sparkling and magical- kind of rescuing it from itself. 

The movie is more of a straightforward humorous twist on the typical hero story- just extremely well done, very funny, and with great acting. It doesn't have the satirical bent so much as making all of the stereotypical elements of a fairy tale about 200% sillier. I absolutely love it, and also absolutely love the grandfather/grandson framing device, and I'm glad that it's not the same as the book because that would never possibly have worked as a straight up adaptation.

akoxx9_8,akoxx9,"It has the perfect pacing, imagery, and dialogue for children (it is a story being told to a child, after all...), so naturally we all fell in love with it.

Kidnapping, giants, swordsmen trying to avenge their fathers, dread pirates, resurrection, deceit, parting, reunion, need I go on?

It paints a world of adult conflict in a way that is accessible (i.e: *not horrific*) to children. We're able to enjoy the high stakes plot without feeling the anxiety or discomfort that is usually associated with life and death plots.

For example, the calm and collected confidence (and excellence) of Westley, the main character, can be felt by the audience (hence we don't think he might fall, or lose, or die). Something about Andre the Giant and Wallace Shawn being paired together is also quite comforting (being each-other's physical and moral *foil*). 

The Princess Bride just seems to take a certain element of uncertainty out of itself, as if the viewer knows all along that everything will work out. For instance, when we are confronted with the determination and passion of Inigo Montoya, we *just know* that he is indeed going to have his revenge against the six fingered man.

The common tropes had a satirist twinge to them (I.e. the Giant, the master swordsman, the magic potions). It is a movie about love or revenge, or so we think (revenge in the novella is highlighted). In the film the love is shallow because first and foremost ""The Princess Bride"" is a comedy. Like Shakespeare you can divide the vast work (for the most part) into tragedy and comedy. A comedy is when they get married at the end. This film is withstanding because it didn't take itself seriously, had defined characters, and a good dose of laughter (not iocane powder).

And I think that still holds true, because prequel and post-original trilogy Star Wars is plagued with CGI and scene cuts. The Princess Bride is elegantly simple and nuanced at the same time. It’s such a unique scene considering the context. The viewers learn via the rope being cut and then re-lowered that neither Wesley nor Inigo are idiots and that they are both forces to be reckoned with and act with honor. Then, when the dueling begins, you can tell that both men are so skilled and you wonder who will win and at the same time, both men are hedging their bets faking to be left handed. It’s so absurd and campy with their dialogue, but the sword play is done quite well.

2chbpn_2,2chbpn,"I could not disagree more. The first person narration is what grounds the story and separates it from merely being another high fantasy yarn with some witty dialogue. The Princess Bride isn't just about ""fencing, fighting, torture, poison, true love, hate, revenge"", but also family, storytelling, and reconciliation with and redemption of the mundanity and disappointments of life. Although I'm certainly biased - my dad read the book to me when I was young (life imitating art), and I didn't see the movie until much later.

Also, some things that are lost from the main narrative:

* The Zoo of Death. Easily one of my favorite parts of the book

* Character backstories. Most are either excised (Fezzik) or reduced to the bare bones (Inigo wants to avenge his father, Wesley spent some time with pirates).

* Suspension of disbelief. The book describes characters and situations which stretch the limits of reality - the most beautiful woman in the world, the greatest fencer(s) in the world, the strongest man in the world, a menagerie of the most dangerous creatures in the world - not to mention enormous carnivorous rats. Portraying all of that on film stretched the capabilities of 80's filmmaking (and the acting capabilities of Andre the Giant).

* Pacing and suspense. Goldman does a great job controlling narrative flow, and puncutates action sequences in a way that's difficult to capture on film.

2chbpn_3,2chbpn,"I find the very idea of an ""incompetent reader"" absurd, snobbish, and frankly, insulting to literature. Part of the core beauty of any ""art"" is that it can be interpreted by the audience.

***SPOILER***: The rest of this comment cannot avoid spoiling the book. I assume that anybody who's gotten here has been spoiled already due to the ""incompetent commenters"" ;-) above. When they place spoiler tags on their comments, I'll follow suit.

Beyond that, a story can be framed in history, and that history can be factual or fictional. Furthermore, it *is* actually possible to write truthfully about a fictional story, while including the story. In honor of Gilbert Godfried's AMA yesterday, my example of that would be the documentary, *The Aristocrats*. But there are tons of examples of all of these types of stories.

Of course, most people will strongly suspect that the parts of *The Princess Bride* from the author's perspective are fictional from the get go, but just because the story is framed does not mean that you know the framing is fictional. But when your suspicions are 100% confirmed due to the author finally misstating a fact that you know, or due to your looking up a very doubtful fact on the internet, or due to you directly looking up the answer as to whether it's factual on the internet, you get a feeling of, ""Aha, I knew it!"".

This ""Eureka Moment"" is a part of the book, and it is not something that I recommend removing from the reader's experience just because you think you're smarter than them.",kamichama,2014-08-03T20:14:44Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,3

31duv1_5,31duv1,"fun random personal story about this book. 

I was at the outdoor flea market with my mom, looking at a table full of $1 books. It was really hot out and starting to rain, and we could see a storm starting to roll in. It started to sprinkle, and I asked my mom if I could just get a book, go sit in the car and read.

I saw a copy of The Princess Bride and grabbed it, because I love the movie but had never read it, and hey, it was a buck. I start back towards the car, and the sky just opens up. I shoved the book under my shirt and ran for it. I get to the car and the book is unharmed, maybe a little damp. 

My mom makes it to the car about 30 seconds later, drenched. We're sitting there drying in the air conditioning, I'm showing her what I got. And I notice it's a first edition. I had been reading the Dark Tower series, and thanks to Calvin Tower I knew first editions of some books were valuable. Took it home and googled, long story less long, sold it on Ebay for $700 and funded my first trip to Vegas. :D 

tl:dr - saved a first edition Princess Bride from a downpour, funded some sin.

7oy5o5_4,7oy5o5,"It reminded me of the play with narration and narrative in early English-language novels. For example, the use of interpolation and interruption delays reader gratification, à la Henry Fielding's *Tom Jones* or Laurence Sterne's *Tristram Shandy*, and in some ways, the frame is a forceful reminder that you are at the mercy of a capricious author (as a reader, you have dues to pay—you must be vigilant and almost seem to be asked to outwit the author as he proves to be ever more unreliable. You are constantly reminded at critical junctures of plot that you have been drawn in and made unwary, compelled to follow, as it were, manipulated into suspending disbelief and into emotional/personal investment). Frames often emphasize the constructedness of the tale, even if such bracketing aims to provide credibility to the narrator. 

In *The Princess Bride*, the frame accomplishes the same thing in delaying reader pleasure in the narrative. We become like the narrator's wife, demanding instead that the narrator attend to the story. We see him at leisure so we will understand that he is forgoing his own pleasure to deliver us this tale. In some ways, it establishes the bond between narrator and audience, underscores the duty to finish a tale in good faith, but at the same time, it keeps the audience aware of its demands and expectations.

Edit: *Also*, the interpolations, interruptions, and frames are tools that encourage active reading, rather than passive receiving of the text. Just asking why the author/implied author/narrator does this in TPB brings you into the realm of reading critically, that is, analytically. In my opinion, that's a good thing, despite how frustrating some of the effects may be. ",LadyFromTheMountain,2018-01-08T16:23:52Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,4

2tjkxq_1,2tjkxq,"I love them both. The Princess Bride is by far my favorite movie ever. I watch it several times a year, I play rhyming games with my son, my desktop background is usually related to the movie. I like the book a lot. It's great, probably in my top 100, but it holds nowhere near the place in my heart that the movie does.

In some ways, it's more complete. The relationship between Inigo and Fezzik is beautiful, Fezzik himself so incredibly tragic. Humperdinck is so much more vile. Count Rugen is actually scary. The torture - if you haven't reached it yet - reading the book's account of the torture is heartbreaking, and it makes the movie's version heartbreaking, too.

The tone of the book, though - especially it's position regarding the existence of true love - is so completely different from the movie. The movie is so hopeful, so positively playful. The book is so cynical, and the interjections that /u/leowr seems to dislike so much are a big part of what make it that way. The 'author' is in a meh marriage, not able to relate to his son, and finds out that this wonderful memory from his childhood is a political tract with adventure in the margins. The whole time he's presenting this story in ways that make it clear the people within aren't quite so happy.

I'll give what I think is a perfect example of the cynicism of the book, but it's a spoiler. If you haven't yet read past the Fire Swamp, go no farther because I don't want to spoil the emotional umph.

In the film, when Buttercup goes back with the prince, she says ""I thought you were dead once and it almost destroyed me. I could not bear it if you died again, not when I could save you."" I don't have the novel in front of me, but she says something like ""I lived without you once before,"" or ""I thought you were dead before and I made it through.""

It's full of things like that. Everything from the discussion of who's the most beautiful woman in the world to the fact that Buttercup only falls in love with Westley when Rugen's wife wants to sleep with him is so much more cynical than what is essentially an optimistic, happy movie.",eurocatisamerican,2015-01-24T21:56:13Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,1

The 30th anniversary edition was 2003, so Goldman having difficulties supersedes the ""promise"" to have it completed by 2023 (think how many times Rothfuss and Martin have promised a book would be released by a particular date, for example).

I'm not a fan of his style of writing, nor of his characterizations, but he has intriguing plots that translate well to movie format. Even his arguably best book IMO -- The Shining -- was still better as a movie.

wvy7sv_1,wvy7sv,"I've noticed I tend to prefer whichever I consumed first. Having loved The Princess Bride for years I was bit ""meh"" on the book when I read it a couple years ago, because I already had a firm idea of what the story ""should"" be, based on what I'd already been exposed to.

Additionally, the thing about books is the author gets a lot more opportunity to explain things to the reader outright. Granted there are some well-loved books that are known for dropping the reader in the middle of a world without much exposition, but it's certainly not the popular choice. It's difficult to do that in a film or series without a character outright explaining a lot of things, which is pretty heavy-handed and can make viewers feel as though the story is being dumbed down for them. An author has the benefit of just telling the reader outright whereas visual media becomes very long-winded if someone tries to explain too much. This leads to things like a character taking a simpler but perhaps out-of-character action as a sort of shortcut to get to the next plot point because the real reasons are too complex to display succinctly. Then the people who enjoy the book get upset about their expectations being subverted in those ways.

The subject matter may be identical but the media in which it is being presented is wholly unique unto itself and warrants a completely different approach to presenting the material than is required in black and white text with (occasional) 2D illustrations.  We should not be judging film or tv book adaptations based upon how perfectly they are able to mimic the writing, but rather by how the acting was done, how the characters were presented, whether or not we enjoyed the audio, the background of the world, the music, the cinematography, and the story-telling.  Some film and tv adaptations of literature is just not that good, but others are amazing!  (Like you said with The Shining, The Princess Bride, and Jurassic Park)  An example of this is that my favorite book of all time is the Odyssey.  It has been written and rewritten dozens if not hundreds of times and reimagined in film and tv also dozens if not hundreds of times.  Some of the book adaptations are hot garbage and so are the films, but some of the book rewrites are deep and emotional and engaging as are some of their film and tv counterparts.

I felt that the complaint wasn't that stories (in general) get made into films, but more about the often times disappointing adaptations of specific stories - often from well known, well loved books (though the OP's use of *The Princess Bride* does strengthen Bitruders comment as I think it is a great adaptation - as do many).

I know you see them as separate, Bitruder, but to me there is obvious overlap between a novel and the film adaptation of said novel, and criticism and comparisons are inevitable, and even warranted.

That said, I have seen movies that improved books - most recently *The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo* movie was superior to the novel (though I have to give that perhaps the novel is a bit clunky due to the translation (I still enjoyed the story - mostly...))

I hear your critique, Bitruder, and I think you are right that there are often times a self-righteous, ""the book is better"" attitudes that come out whenever a film adapts a popular novel. And I also don't like when such sentiments are merely knee jerk reactions making the unfounded assumption that the written word is superior to visual mediums.

obbavu_3,obbavu,"You know of The Princess Bride? The original work is being withheld by the original author's (S. Morgenstern) estate and the only version available to the average reader is the abridged version by William Goldman. It's nearly impossible to find an unabridged version!

The only good thing to come from this is the abridged version details Goldman's experiences dealing with the Morgenstern estate. It's quite the story!",spankymcjiggleswurth,2021-07-01T16:46:08Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,3

a4mvva_1,a4mvva,I was good friends with a girl who refused to read *The Princess Bride* until she found an unabridged copy. I told her that it didn’t exist and it was just made up for the book but she was convinced and nothing I said could convince her otherwise. I don’t know if she ever accepted the truth but if she did she is the type of person to deny that she ever thought differently.,ssilvernail,2018-12-10T00:17:35Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,1
a4mvva_2,a4mvva,"1. Goldman based the story off a book by s. Morganstern...

a4mvva_3,a4mvva,"I was thinking that! *The Princess Bride* is set in the time those novels were published, no? Maybe Goldman was unconsciously using a device popular among authors in that time, giving it a greater authenticity.

7q61t6_1,7q61t6,I haven't had a book that stopped me from reading but I also really disliked The Princess Bride. You could try reading a book that's completely different or maybe go back to one of your favourites and see if you can get back into reading by finishing that? ,PensiveProjection,2018-01-13T18:10:18Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,1
7q61t6_2,7q61t6,"I agree with you OP...Reading the Princess Bride was a chore. I only stuck through it for the character back stories and the Zoo of Death chapter. 
  The book is painfully slow as he takes way too long to tell how he found the book, etc . and then to add insult to injury...once the fair tale narrative FINALLY begins...he fucking stops every third paragraph to tell the reader what he cut out of the “original story”. The story has no flow because he constantly interrupts and he even acknowledges said fact by saying “If you haven’t thrown the book at the wall yet”.

It's a fun film that people remember fondly for its execution of great scenes and characters from the novel, but as a technical piece of filmmaking it's really nothing special at all, while the novel had some really neat tricks up its sleeve with the 'S Morgenstern' framing device.

fgmvg_2,fgmvg,"I'd definitely recommend Od Magic by Patricia Mckillip. It's a very fairy tale-esk book that bowled me over with a sense of wonder. There's less physical traveling involved than in The Hobbit, but the aforementioned wonder more than makes up for it, IMO.

Sabriel by Garth Nix is also worth a shot. It's a YA fantasy about a Necromancer in a world with a brilliant magic system, and the book contained many scenes that have stuck in my mind.

Also, Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones is shear brilliance.

I also second the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (waaay better than than the movie), The Princess Bride (do NOT let the cover or title put you off), and Watership Down (it's about rabbits!)",Escheria,2011-02-07T07:33:31Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Princess Bride,2

>I'd absolutely love to offer a Princess Bride or Brave New World design.  The issue is that they are still under copyright, so it's a bit of a process to license them from the publisher and estate.  One of our goals for 2014 is to pick up the rate that we're licensing contemporary works, and these books are near the top of our list.

Over 9 years later here’s a link to all the Princess Bride items.

I was looking for more Sci Fi Beat authors rn, but I believe I’ll be buying me  something Vonnegut, HG wells, and between either  novel -or- screenplay
