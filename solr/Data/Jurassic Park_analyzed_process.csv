Her character in the movie was way spazzy, but if you look at the world from the point of view of a pre-teen girl suddenly shoved into a world with real dinos, I think it kinda makes sense. 

I know if I was 12 or 13 and dropped into Jurassic Park where a T-Rex and Raptors were trying to eat my faceoff, I'd be annoying too.",Rainbow_Colored_Fox,2021-04-24T03:18:34Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,4
mx6h2k_5,mx6h2k,Jurassic Park’s one of the few books where I strongly prefer the movie. There are some cool extra stuff in the book then the movie however Chriton’s technophobia had always grated on me and the books mean spiritedness ultimately made the book unpleasant compared to the movie which despite everything had awe and hopefulness.,_Fun_Employed_,2021-04-24T09:08:06Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,5

Genaro sees them arrive and freaks out for a reason, this is no place for a 5 year old and Hammond is a lunatic for using his grand kids. She’s a plot device.

Edit: also really, really glad to see Jurassic Park and Crichton in general getting some love here. He wrote some great spec fiction/sc-fi along with some awesome adventure novels. Eaters of the Dead needs more attention, along with the Great Train Robbery. Andromeda Strain, the original Westworld movie, etc.

Aside from The Great Train Robbery and Andromeda Strain (maybe), the books are universally better than the film adaptations. Even Congo is fun book with some depth.",AdmiralRed13,2021-04-23T23:42:02Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,15

mx6h2k_20,mx6h2k,"That scene was super weird, in fact, because all the control systems in Jurassic Park are all SGI workstations and servers and they all run IRIX.

Lex is using IRIX's 3D File Browser, which makes this shit all the more ridiculous because:

1) She would have to have access to an SGI workstation - the cheapest configurations in 1993 were around $15,000. I get she comes from a rich family **that spares no expense**, but I can't imagine even wealthy parents throwing a $15,000+ computer *that's literally marketed to visual effects professionals, oil & gas simulations, and university-level computation and visualization* at a 10/11 year old girl, but whatever... it still leads us into *this* problem...

2) If she had actually used IRIX and its 3D File Browser before, why didn't she just say, ""It's an IRIX system, I know this!"" instead? The average person watching the movie would know just as much about IRIX in 1993 as they would have known about UNIX.

3) Even amongst those people who owned or had access to SGI machines, they rarely used the 3D File Browser since it was really just superfluous showing off of SGI workstation capabilities.",Rathadin,2021-04-24T06:28:06Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,20

mx6h2k_25,mx6h2k,"That's the plot of pretty much every science fiction story ever written. That basically is the genre. I think it comes from the victorian era and early 20th century when science began to regularly clash with religion and stories were written as cautionary tales about not abandoning the ways of God. 

Most science fiction has an underlying anti-progress message, like ""Look how the hubris of man made him forget his place in the world and try to play God! See how his lack of humility was his undoing!""

From that perspective, Jurassic Park has a very traditional sci-fi message, but I think that's forgivable as it is basically a genre thriller, albeit a very creative and well- presented one.",99thLuftballon,2021-04-24T07:58:09Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,25

Spielberg was very impressed with him, but Mazzello was just too young for a role at the time. When it came time to cast for Jurassic Park Spielberg knew he wanted Mazzello to play Timmy. He decided to switch the characters ages since Mazzello was still too young to fit the ""computer wiz"" part so instead he just split up BookTim's personality between the two siblings.

471tk1_3,471tk1,"There were tons of differences between the movie and the novel, many of which I wish had been incorporated into the movies more thoroughly.

- A compy kills a baby and attacks a girl on a beach at the beginning, which starts an overarching subplot where the Costa Rican government is very concerned with what Hammond has created on Isla Nublar.
- Far more detailed discussion of how InGen gathered the dinosaur DNA and how they managed to make a living dinosaur with it
- Malcolm's character in the book has a very interesting part where he shows the flaws in how they've accounted for the dinosaurs with an automated system.  When they change the number they were looking for they realize that their animals are breeding.
- Gennaro is way less of a weasel in the book than in the movie.  He ends up being very capable and brave in the book
- The character of Ed Regis is entirely missing in the movie, he gets killed by a juvenile tyrannosaur.  This character has aspects of his personality that were used for the assistant chick in Jurassic World
- Muldoon shoots raptors with a freakin rocket launcher in the book, it's pretty cool
- the aviary sequence in Jurassic World and JP3 were pretty much lifted from the novel for Jurassic Park
- Henry Wu gets killed by a raptor in the novel
- They discover the raptor nest in the book, Raptors behaved like migratory birds
- much more in depth discussion of the surprising behaviors of the animals
- the sick Triceratops mystery is discovered as the Triceratops sometimes needed to eat small stones for aid in digestion and in so doing was eating West Indian Lilac and getting sick
- the Tyrannosaur was very elusive and prone to sun burn in the book, hence why the tour idea was a bad idea to begin with
- Hammond dies in the book, killed by compies
- the Costa Rican government completely destroys everything on Isla Nublar, including the animals and the facilities.  They cover everything up so as not to cause a panic among the public. Ingen has to file for Chapter 11 protection because of the massive loss of assets and intellectual property.
- Malcolm dies in the book, killed by wounds sustained during the tyrannosaur attack

471tk1_30,471tk1,"GOD. YES. 
Ok so lemme point out that Jurassic Park is still one of my favorite novels, and one of two I make sure to reread yearly (the other is The Last Unicorn). And I bring that up because Lex is more enraging than Haggard's insufferable rants on objectification and the meanings of happiness. It is quite possibly one of the only times I vastly preferred that the plot was altered for the film (also my favorite movie.) 
Both are wonderful storylines that change hugely based on the portrayal of Hammond, Wu, and the kids - one made very dark and thrilling and menacing, and the other full of hard lessons of idealism and strength through teamwork. Idk, I know at this point I'm definitely rambling, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that I have a lot of love for this story, and the differences (mostly) strengthened that. 
Also, I would give The Lost World a peek. It's pretty awful, and at this point it's basically Darker and Edgier Jurassic Park with Ian Malcolm limping his way in Dr Grant's place. Also the villain is a whiny rich bone-obsessed pissbaby heir to a toy company who's tone is comparable to Dandy Mott or a young Draco Malfoy.

471tk1_33,471tk1,"I have read Jurassic Park probably 15 times over the last 20 years and I absolutely love every word. Lex in the book is a younger version of the Lex we see in the movie. I prefer the book version more because she is a more realistic version of a young, spoiled rich girl. The Lex from the movie is whiny and a liability but when Spielberg switched their ages he did a real disservice to the character of Tim.

In the novel Tim is the capable one with all the answers looking after his younger sister. In the movie he is still capable but his abilities seem less real because he is the younger of the two siblings. Don't get me wrong I take any chance I can get to watch the movei and was the only one of my friends or family who saw it when it was re-released in 3D (even though i despise 3D). I was alone in the theater quoting every word... I digress.

Lex is supposed to be whiny and a liability because she is a child and a child, especially at her age, would not understand the consequences of her actions. Spielberg's decision to make her older and less of a liability caters to this delusion in Hollywood that children are just tiny versions of adults. That their brains are fully developed and they can rationalize things and make smart choices. I don't know about you but I have worked with children and even the smartest of kids at that age have trouble rationalizing things.

I went off on that whole thing to finish by saying that they are almost two separate entities for me and each one of them has positives and negatives but in truth I enjoy Lex's character in both for different reasons.",cirignanon,2016-02-23T06:58:39Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,33

The other nice thing about Crichton in general that doesn't carry over into movies is the plots are backed up with some fairly in-depth technical background. He obviously does his research, and even though I'm sure he takes a lot of liberties with science and technology it makes the fantastic premises of his stories almost plausible. That background is obviously hard to convey in a 2 hour movie and gets completely glossed over or omitted, although Jurassic Park did a pretty good job with that short cartoon the characters watched (which was obviously meant more for the viewers).",we_are_all_stupid,2016-02-23T01:51:43Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,41

471tk1_46,471tk1,"Some of this is embellished, especially at the very end, but most of it is based off of the books plot and my own personal experience with non-programmers and bad contracts.

Imagine that a group of scientists, biologists to be exact, come up with an idea for how to manipulate DNA on a micro scale. It works perfectly. Now they want to scale up. Automate it, make it more refined. They also have invented dozens of advanced computational analysis devices besides. Advanced chemistry and the like. Pause.

Imagine another group of scientists, zoologists this time, want to make a zoo. But the animals are so unknown that they can only really guess at how best to keep them alive. In order to do that, they must keep track of all of their vitals and movements constantly. They need to be recorded visually in case there's any change in behavior or damage to their enclosure that needs to be fixed. There's hundreds of specimens of three dozen species across a couple hundred square miles. Pause.

Imagine a third group, but these guys are engineers of the theme-park variety. This is going to be the most advanced theme park in history. Everything is automated. Nothing can EVER break down, everything must be tracked, all the rides (which don't exist anywhere else in the world), all the guests, etc. If anyone's needs aren't immediately met there will be hell to pay. Pause.

Enter Hammond. He's not a nice grandfatherly figure like in the movie. He's an immoral unscrupulous business man. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He has a history of throwing money and lawyers at situations until they disappear as well as doing his damnedest to beat the competition at any and every level. He's told everyone he will spare no expense, so those guys above? They go HAM! Anything and everything they want, they get.

Except none of them are programmers. None of them are IT. 

Enter Dennis Nedry. Hammond calls him up and says ""I got this project. It's just like a zoo theme park thing. Should be no big deal right?""

But it was a big deal. Like, a HUGE FUCKING DEAL. Nedry was in so far over his head. He had to build a zoo, a theme park, a hotel, and this crazy science bullshit from scratch! This isn't what he signed up for! He's dealing with eight  super computers which are about seven and a half times more than what exist in any other single location, physical storage in terms of petabytes or 1000s of terabytes, and data throughput that dwarfed the entire internet at the time. He's dealing with literally thousands of audio-video inputs and phone lines and radios. He's dealing with scientific equipment that he doesn't have the qualifications to even observe let alone operate or maintain. He's dealing with live animals that don't exist anywhere else and have no equivalents to fall back on. 

Windows XP rang in at over 45 million lines of code and over 10,000 contributors. That's just for the operating system. Nedry's small team did that, and more. Literally everything they did was groundbreaking, like Nobel Prize ground breaking. They've dropped everything in their lives to move to South America and work over 80 hours a week for months, even years.  And to top it all off he and his team are scared out their god damned minds because they're doing this on an island that is actively trying to kill them, as evidenced by the hastily reinforced windows and fences. 

But Hammond is a typical CEO. He's above computer problems, IT problems. He doesn't understand them. It's not like you have models you have to stress test like in engineering. So why can't you just press a button and make it work? He's sick and tired throwing money at it. Clearly they're just bad at their jobs. It must work, yet he's also out of money. He can see the physical results of building the cages and the hotel and the rides and the docks. He can't see lines of code. That's money that's just disappearing into thin air. It must be Nedry's fault. He knew what he was getting into, it says so right here in his contract!

Nedry is depressed. As fuck, even. He's a nerd, dinosaurs are cool, and cloning is fucking bonkers insanely awesome. If he were just a visitor, he'd think this island is the coolest thing since Star Wars. As an employee, he wants it to succeed. Holy shit, having your name on JURASSIC PARK? That's a ticket to any project you could ever want. He'd be the next Wozniak and Gates. But he just isn't physically capable of working within the parameters he was given. His team slaves over these computers for months and months, yet there were still problems. Now he's addicted to caffeine and cigarettes which he can't afford, he's gained 100 pounds because he sits and stresses at his computer 14 hours a day. He's reached his breaking point. He's signed and NDA and a contract so he can't talk to anyone and if he breaks the contract InGEN will have him penniless so fast he might as well have just killed himself. And he can't do that because the contract wasn't with a company he ran, it was with him and each individual employee. He's not a lawyer, he didn't know how much that would fuck them. He can't get help, so he's lost and burnt out.

He gets drunk one night, and messages his buddy back home. Word gets around, quietly and slowly, that he's unhappy, and that what they're doing is so amazing but just can't work the way Hammond wants it. Somehow, another company hears of it, and offers Nedry something he can't refuse: salvation. Fuck the contract, here's enough money that you won't have to work ever again. There's enough there for you and every one of your coworkers. Just get us the samples. Nedry built every system there, he has the power to do that and delete all the evidence.

So he does. ",,2016-02-23T10:06:42Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,46

I loved it when it first read it, after having been gifted it for Christmas and knowing nothing about what to expect from it, and it lead to me reading all the Crichton I could find. Memories of some of the death scenes >!in particular, Wu and Hammond!< remain burned into my mind. A book where it's a good toss up as to whether or not the book or the movie is better, and the movie is hella good. I like the themes, and how well Crichton does to have them sort of reinforced by the action, and the procedural puzzle solving moments are very satisfying. Even just typing it out now I'm reminded of how many little things that I remember from it, like Ellen thinking about inappropriate plants.

That said, Ian Malcom.

*Jurassic Park* is the sort of literary equivalent for me of pictures of me as a Juggalo. It's attitude of insufferable intellectual superiority, largely voiced through the patron saint of Redditors everywhere Ian Malcom as he lies on a morphine drip and Author Filibuster on an enormous amount of topics that, now, seem borderline ridiculous, but at the time was the coolest thing ever and who I wanted to be. There's a lot of old science fiction that has bad science in it that feels excusable, but with *Jurassic Park*, it's the worst because of how much it doubles down on that sort of thing as part of a quasi-political but definitely moralistic message. And just Not Okay because it binds it up in sort of rhetoric about science and reason that would come to dominate argumentation, all 'facts don't care about your feelings' and what not. And I feel particularly bummed out about that sort of thing, which makes it hard even as a guilty read.

snmjb8_27,snmjb8,"I wouldn't rate it very low, but as an engineer I wouldn't rate it very high either.

The problem that Jurassic Park has is that Chrichton is trying to explain ""Complex systems fail in complex ways."", which is very true. But at it's core, Jurassic Park isn't a complex system failing at all. The way Chrichton describes it, was DESIGNED to fail.

There's no possible way that Jurassic Park as described in the book could have been constructed, EVERY single aspect of the park is designed to fail in as fail-deadly a methodology as possible. And that's ignoring the impossibility of a lot of the stated aspects of it.

**Programming**

In the book, the reason that Nedry is pissed off at Hammond and engaging in Industrial Espionage is because Nedry's company bid for Hammond's ""Automated Amusement Park"" contract, which had almost zero further information provided to bidders. That right there is a red flag right there, no matter how ""good for it"" you seem and no matter how actually military-classified a construction project is, there's still a mountain of information provided to the contractors for bidding purposes because otherwise they'd have zero idea how much to bid. Is this amusement park just a tiny side-show attraction and a million is hugely too much? Is this amusement park the largest on the planet and a million wouldn't even cover the cost of setting up your own server environment to code in?

After winning the contract, Nedry asks for more information...and is told no. His company is required to build the software to run every single aspect of one of the larger amusement parks on the planet with literally no information. Even the number of rides, much less the specific electrical/mechanical equipment involved was information he wasn't allowed to have. So Nedry in a fit of sanity said he was backing out. But then Hammond threatens that he's got the world's billionaires behind him and he'll make sure that Nedry and everyone who works for him will never get another job of any kind for the rest of their lives if he backs out.

So Nedry makes the deal that he's going to move to the island and be isolated till the park opens and will SINGLEHANDEDLY code the entire park on-site. Now, that alone is an impossible feat all on its own, but this boils down to one aspect about how the park worked. To keep track of the population of dinosaurs, there are cameras (with insanely good image recognition, but I digress) that you ask ""Is there X number of Y breed of dinosaurs?"". In effect, this was written as ""If there are at LEAST X number of Y breed of dinosaurs, say yes."". I do not know a single programmer alive that would program a system like that even accidentally. WORST case, you have the counting system finish counting, and ask ""Is X == numberOfDinos?"". And BEST case, given that the system in question was a goddamn command-line interface, your actual output would be ""Number of Dinos Found: X, Number of Dinos Sought: Y."" with maybe an additional yes/no declaration somewhere.

In any sane world, the only possible way that any single human could have possibly programmed the park to the depth required would have been to have used automated methods for your code writing...and then just never actually go back and fix the INEVITABLE bugs or lack of tuning.

Which means the park should have been falling apart before Grant and the others even showed up.

**Electrical**

Later on in the book the park has actually entirely recovered. The T-rex is tranqed as are the raptors and such, they are mending fences, etc. But the park still fails because...main power shut down and the backup system had no method of informing ANYONE that it was active until it was only a few minutes away from shutting down.

And the main power system? According to Hammond ""We never wrote down how to turn it on, because it was never supposed to be turned off."".

Fucking WHAT?!

There's not a contractor on the planet that would be capable of building the sort of power plant systems Jurassic Park needed that would just install the system and then leave without handing you the documentation to the system they just built for you. The liability it opens them up to is just mindbogglingly huge. They wouldn't ALLOW you to refuse the documentation.

Not to mention that systems are built to standards, codes, etc. Even if you pointed out to your contractor ""Hey! We're our own autonomous island, you don't need to do any of that!"", guess what? They'll still do most of it by the book (they way they do it on all the other projects) simply because it would take more effort for them to NOT to. Power systems are something taken very seriously by the quality of company capable of setting up a park like that.

Because again, if Hammond ACTUALLY got someone willing to just throw the book away, the park would have been falling apart before the events of the book.

There's more, but it's been like 8 years since I last read the book so I've forgotten a fair number of issues.

What can be done better? Look at the below post to see!

He tries to sweep the horrific death of one of his workers under the rug. He's trying to get the park approved by the insurance companies by rushing some experts through.

And he constantly risks people's lives for his benefit. After the storm, pretty much everyone is safe. Grant and the kids are in a safe bit of the park and the rest of the people are in the bunker.

His own staff implore him to use the lysine contingency to let the dinosaurs die while they wait it out in safety. But Hammond uses a sob story about his kids (who are perfectly safe) to get Arnold and Muldoon to go out there and risk their lives to reset the fences and save Hammond's expensive dinosaurs.

mprzio_4,mprzio,"I have recently read Jurassic Park I can't say either is superior to the other. They are definitely different beasts though dinosaurs are treated like genuine animals and the theme of ""playing god"" with nature is omnipresent in both the movie and the book. They go more in-depth on the chaos theory which I enormously appreciate. It is sad that the concept is either explained poorly in the movie or completely dismissed as Ian's self-indulgent math babble. Ultimately, it is integral to the premise of the park itself.  


There are awesome scenes in the book that don't make the appearance in the movie but I think it was due to technological limitations - like the T-Rex chase scene by the river. 

Also I thank goodness they made Lex older in the movie and less annoying. I literally wanted Lex to get eaten by a first dinosaur she encountered in the book. She is easily the most insufferable character in th ebook, and utterly useless and dumb even for such a young child. 

  
I think Tim from the book was split into two characters Lex and Tim in the movie. The character traits Tim possesses in the book are given to the kids like Tim's knowledge of dinosaurs and craftiness, and Lex's computer expertise. They just made Tim from the book be two characters which is a good idea and I approve of that change by Spilberg.

I think it fits the movie better to be honest. The concept of Jurassic Park is something that a lot of people would enjoy, regardless of seeing the movies and we're right there with the group as they're all shocked at the lake scene reveal. I guarantee a lot of people who walk out of Jurassic Park would 100% buy tickets if the real thing existed.

And then the cracks start to creep in slowly. Dinosaurs don't behave like robots and show up whenever you want them. The triceratops enclosure isn't an adequate environment and they get sick eating berries by accident. T-rex isn't big on an easy snack to entice the patrons. Then it turns out Hammond has got the park so automated it puts critical infrastructure under the control of a programmer who regrets his low bid and lack of respect. The park completely breaks down and his own grand kids are put at risk, and the dinos are breeding, etc. Conversations like the one he has with Ellie while in the dining room with the melted ice cream are more interesting from a cinematic perspective than portraying him as a know nothing borderline conman. Also, film Hammond fits much better when you remove Crichton's screeds from the books.

I think they're two sides of the same coin, just that a misguided dreamer who didn't respect the power he was playing with fits what the movie was going for better.",Hail_Britannia,2021-04-13T06:23:54Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,7

The Lord of the Rings is one of my favourite books, but  a warning: Lord of the Rings is a slow action novel, is like a travel book. If you expect a lot of action (as the movies),    
you will be disappointed. An example: the battle on the second film (about 1/3 or 1/4 of the film's footage) lasts 10 pages of 500 ( approximately ).

mprzio_12,mprzio,"> And a praise for Michael Crichton: I just came from reading Jeff Vandermeer's Area X trilogy. Vandermeer has a way of slowing down reading with heavy diction and over explainations

Yeah one of his books in that trilogy was like 90% paperwork and slow investigation, followed by all of the action and immediately ending.  If the ratios were flipped I would have loved that book so much, but instead it was a shockingly boring slog that felt like the author was on his last page of paper to write on to jot down all the interesting bits when it ends.

A lot of the problems with a slower paced, explanation heavy book would have been problems with a Jurassic Park movie that filled in more dinosaurs, and more touring of the park.  Think Ready Player One but instead of pop culture references, it's dinosaurs.  I can't really fault the movie for these kinds of creative decisions.",Autarch_Kade,2021-04-13T06:02:37Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,12

How they made it into a Mattel/ Burger King friendly franchise, with a target audience of 7 year-olds is truly beyond me.

But what just clicked for me is probably a big reason why, it’s the way it’s written. That same approach is why I love Jodi Picoult books. Each chapter is from 1 characters perspective which helps the story feel more rounded and her research on the related topic is so thorough I always come out learning something valuable even if the main character stories are all fiction.

mprzio_22,mprzio,"I am a MASSIVE Crichton fan, and like you, *Jurassic Park* was my first introduction.

Obviously, I would recommend *The Lost World*. It is similarly different than the movie, although you'll find some of the cinematic differences in *Jurassic Park* are cribed from the *Lost World* book.

However, based on your response, I would recommend Crichton's complete body of work. They are all similarly organized, technical, and thrilling. Another Crichton easter egg (at least in print) each chapter header has some graphic or nugget which parallels the novel's progression. IIRC in *Jurassic Park*, it's a relatively simple fractal which spirals out of control in an analogy between Malcolm's favorite Chaos thory and the quickly unraveling structure of the park.

Uniquely, the movie adaptions of Crichton's books are generally pretty good. *13th Warrior* is one of my favorite movies and *Eaters of the Dead* is one of my favorite novels.

Congo is an amazing novel. While the plot is centered around computers( well, one of the characters' motivations.) It is hidden within an amazing adventure. The tech stuff is extremely outdated now,( think late 80's tech) but is sidelined by where the characters end up. The movie was a quick cash grab using Chrichton's name after Jurassic Park.

I said “screw this let’s restart the level” and gave up running. Then those jaws came down around me. I’m 39 now lol.

A word of advice before reading The Lord of the Rings, read The Hobbit, if you haven't already. LOTR can be a bit cumbersome to someone who isn't expecting the number of songs and poems that are strewn throughout it, or doesn't know that Tolkien was a linguist who spoke nearly 17 languages and loves to celebrate the art of syntax. Some of the songs and cultural references in it will make a good deal more sense, historically, if you read The Simarillion someday.",AuctorLibri,2021-04-13T13:48:54Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,82
mprzio_83,mprzio,"The way Crichton writes makes everything seem a lot more chilling vs onscreen. Screen version of Jurassic Park is there for the large spectacle; Chrichton’s Jurassic Park shows horror and terror without the need for spectacle. For example, my favorite passage in the book is Nedry’s death. In the movie, he runs screaming away from the little venom dinosaurs; in the book, there’s a passage about Nedry coming upon the dinosaurs, being inquisitive, and then realizing something warm was coming out of his stomach; he looks down and it’s his intestines. 

So subtle and chilling!

You're right that they flipped the children, making the girl older and boy younger (but still making the girl the fraidy-cat - lame). They also left out the whole subplot of the dinosaurs on the boat heading to the mainland, and that ending with the T-Rex saving the day.... uuggghhh.

Look, the book the way it was written was in no shape to be made directly into a movie - and movies by necessity of time constraints can only do so much if they want something to be impactful. I really enjoyed the book, but I was also just so enamored with how they were able to take that story and turn it into something as fun and epic as Jurassic Park turned out to be. The movie is incredible, and ill never forget seeing it in theaters for the first time. The book had more science, the kids were beyond annoying, and Malcom was even starting to get on my nerves towards the end. I thought they balanced those things really well in the film and were able to make the kids identifiable and relatable. You cared for those kids. In the book, i dont think I would have cared if they died honestly, the way they were written.

I wouldnt mind a re-imagining of the first one taking elements from the book that werent used, of which there are many. I do however think that the film was done extremely well even if it didnt exactly mirror the book.",aliveandwellthanks,2021-04-13T15:42:14Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,99

mprzio_127,mprzio,"This is one of the differences I like in the book - Genaro represents investors in the park, but even though he/his firm have a lot to gain from the park, he's fully on the ""burn it to the ground"" train.  I do like that the movie took different routes with some characters - after all, you have less time to set up a large cast of interesting characters in a 2 hour movie than a 400 page book.  They simplified the cast somewhat, and I think some of the character changes (ie Hammond being much more personable) were in part to make them fit the actors who were cast.  I think that's something that book-to-film adaptations have to work with that we can overlook.  Finding someone to perfectly fit a book character as-written is tough.  Sometimes, you can really NAIL it, but not always - I think Hammond was a case where they opted to go the jollier route for that reason.  

Uh yeah this got ramble-y didn't it - they're great and I like talking about them!  Jurassic Park remains a 10 for me, both the movie and the book.",Ardis_Kurita,2021-04-13T06:22:26Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,127

86ekk3_10,86ekk3,"Jurassic Park was one of my favorite books in High School...I had decided to read it after the movie came out and was impressed at how much more I liked the story.  I've often found that the greatest barrier for many people to enjoy reading is (surprise) finding a book they actually enjoy reading.  So often we grow up with books thrust upon us that we may not have any interest in yet or might not captivate us; sometimes just because we don't know what flavor of books we like yet.

One of the books I always recommend to my friends when they just want an entertaining read is *Villa Incognito* by Tom Robbins.  It's wacky, it's thought-provoking, it has an intricate story that many find fascinating, and it's just a damned fun book.

Clearly this thread has blown up at this stage, but if you're ever in the mood to read a book that might make you laugh while also engaging your brain.

I *love* the movie, I enjoyed reading The Sphere, and I really enjoyed the start of the book... however, the anti-science rants he has Ian Malcolm go on really killed it for me. He used Malcolm as a mouthpiece for a budding hatred of the scientific community. After reading Jurassic Park I realized that resentment towards the scientific community was a continuing theme in his later works, and he ultimately went on to oppose climate change prevention. It all kind of killed my ability to enjoy his writing.

Also, as other people have mentioned, I feel like a lot of his characters are incredibly flat.

EDIT: OP, this isn’t to disparage your enjoyment of the book. I think Crichton is excellent at writing exciting and compelling stories, and I’m honestly very sad that I feel like I can’t enjoy his work anymore. I’m happy you’re getting into reading.

When he died I honestly felt like I lost a friend, his books have been a huge influence on me over the years.

And for anyone else who misses him as much as I do, you might want to check out the following two books:

Mayday by Thomas Block and Nelson DeMille - fans of Airframe especially

The Flock by James Robert Smith - very Crichtonesque, more natural horror than technothriller but so, so worth it. I am eternally sad he hasn't written anything else yet.",Cymas,2018-03-23T12:23:55Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,66

Other Crichton books are pretty solid though from the pure enjoyment measure.  I would also recommend Lois McMaster Bujold for that same quality - of books that are simply written (but not dumbed down at all), where the story if first, second, and last, and the author has little ambition but to tell the most engaging story they can.",hippydipster,2018-03-23T13:18:12Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,67
86ekk3_68,86ekk3,"Like others have said, go for The Lost World next, chunks of both books were used to make all three movies. 

Another very interesting book was The Bones of the Earth by Michael Swanwick. It mixes dinosaurs and time travel. Imagine if Paleontologists could go back and actually observe dinosaurs in their natural habitat. 

I haven't read it, but it is on my TBR list, is the Dinosaur Lords series by Victor Milan. It is a cross of Jurassic Park and Game of Thrones. Three book series and I believe all three books are out. The other two are the Dinosaur Knights, and the Dinosaur Princess. The series was getting very good reviews when it release and I am looking forward to it. 

Lastly, Crichton just released a new dinosaur book called the Dragon's Teeth, released posthumously. Again, I haven't read it yet, waiting for a sale to pick it up.

86ekk3_103,86ekk3,"Is it really that much better? I read them in order and I strongly preferred Jurassic Park because of Henry Wu's slow and amazing reveal of how the science behind the dinosaurs worked and how he installed genetic failsafes to keep the park safe, and Ian Malcolm's slow and amazing dismantling of every single one of his postulates (for example searching for a higher # of dinosaurs on the computer, the normally distributed poisson graph compared to the 3 humps graph that it should have been due to releasing the compys in batches, etc) 

In contrast in The Lost World, I might not have read carefully but first of all the guys weren't even too surprised to see the dinosaurs (when did Malcolm tell them?). There was a lot more emphasis on nesting behavior and territory marking instead of the amazing Henry Wu-Ian Malcolm interactions, but it sounded kind of weird that the T rex just sat on the car and marked it... wouldn't 20 tons sitting on the car straight up break the car?

And it's not some gut feeling. He reasons his way through it and has the park staff provide proof in a matter of minutes.

As for his lecturing, the man is a lecturer. I know plenty of people like that. it doesn't make them one-dimensional. Malcolm build a career around warning against exactly the thing he sees in Jurassic Park.

I also think you've kind of missed the point of the story. You seem to think the story is supposed to blame science while in reality it should blame capitalists.

Crichton's / Malcolm's point is that the way science works allows us to learn new knowledge faster than we learn to be responsible for them. The fact that the capitalists pushed a little harder than the scientists wanted to go is irrelevant.

The point is that the way science works is that it's building blocks on building blocks. Nobody has to learn everything from scratch. Everyone just builds on the work of their predecessors. Standing on the shoulders of giants and all that.

And that's how we end up with nearly godlike powers and a child's sense of responsibility. The scientists and capitalists were quibbling over details.

ybsznb_20,ybsznb,"Ha. Glad to see another Crichton fan (albeit a critical one). Hes always been a favorite author of mine.

I reread Jurassic Park for the third or fourth time in June. I loved it, as I did the times before. 

But, you’re 100% right. I caught myself, as I do frequently in many Crichton books, thinking “there is no way that a character would EVER speak this way, outside of a lecture or presentation.” It’s mostly attributable to Malcolm in JP, because he’s the guy Crichton used as a mouthpiece for his own opinions… but Grant and Ellie do it a few times too on paleontological issues. And there are numerous examples of it in his other books.. 

It’s something I’ve always chalked up to poetic license with Crichton, because he has a very specific formula to his techno-thrillers (and because they’re so entertaining)... He finds some new technology (cloning animals/dinosaurs… or quantum computing.. or whatever), weaves in a big picture scientific idea (chaos theory.. time travel.. the computer as an analogue for a human brain.. etc), then finds a thriller out of it.

And in order for him to explain his concepts, he needs a LOT of exposition. Like, over and over and over again. And he usually either does it by either 1) having long excerpts that sound like they’re lifted straight from a textbook or 2) he throws it into dialogue… You can go into any Crichton book and count the number of times he has one character throw a softball question to another character.. JUST so that character can respond with a mini-lecture.

Noone actually speaks like the characters do in his books. By now, I don’t even really expect them to. I read those long diatribes like they’re narrators in a documentary.",tysontysontyson1,2022-10-24T16:35:23Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,20

I took his main point to be less about the age/experience of scientists or anybody in particular, and more about the nature of the scientific field in general. There's a section where he talks about how the focus on accomplishment leads scientists to continue to exploit and prod at the natural world even when there's no real reason to do so beyond the fact that they can.

""Discovery is always a rape of the natural world. Always. The scientists want it that way. They have to stick their instruments in. They have to leave their mark. They can't just watch.

ybsznb_26,ybsznb,"Malcom wasn't saying that at all.  Chaos theory by itself is just about predictability, nothing to do with humans and psychology.  It was just combined with his conjecture about Chaos Theory being combined with arrogant scientists and leaders.   

Chaos Theory is saying you cannot predict things you do not understand (taking data, assuming you have all the data or dismissing the flaw that you don't and then drawing a conclusion).  If making something incredibly complicated like Jurassic Park, you will be having to make millions of decisions on incomplete or estimated data.  You may even think it perfect but you also do not know what you do not know so there are thousands of other micro variables that will interact and after iteration the divergence from predictable is actually a given.  

The experience level of scientists is actually contributor, and this is where human nature interacts with chaos theory and blows up all predictions.   If you are a young scientist you make snappy dumb decisions and don't see the harm in estimating and have no caution because you'll react and adapt quickly, so this leads to arrogance and dismissal that anything can go out of control, but if you are an old codger like Hammond then you have years of experience and that gives you false confidence that everything will be fine because you've seen it before and lived to tell the tale before.  This again breeds arrogance and eventually you will misapply your confidence on something you know nothing about or think that spending more money on more experts will get you what you want when it just digs you deeper and puts the blinders on more.

Jurassic Park was a philosophy book and everybody wants it to be Clive Cussler action adventure without any deep thought, just good guys bad guys and planes and helicopters and action.

The Terminal Man did scary things with computers and microchips in 1972 when computers were a strange and alien thing to people.

It's not coincidental that Jurassic Park was released around the time the public first started to learn what genetic engineering is.

1. While Nedry was told what systems he was working with, he was never allowed actual physical contact with the machines. He had to create the programs and have the programs sent over for installation.
2. They never actually told him what he was designing programs *for*. Instead of ""we need this system to record how much the theropods are eating in a day"" they told him ""we need parameters designed to record."" For *every automated system*.
3. Threatened to sue him for violating his original contract with the company if he didn't fly out and administer to the inevitable glitches first hand.
4. Strong armed him into flying outside his country, with *none* of his typical tools, with no accommodations for his stay (the others got rooms in the resort; Nedry was told to bunk by the computers), and to do this *without pay or financial compensation*.

17x1dxt_18,17x1dxt,"I actually prefer the changes the movie makes to the story in many cases, as do many from what I've heard. 

Jurassic Park is one of those instances where I think a valid argument can be made that the film is better, but I appreciate both quite a bit for different reasons. 

I think Malcolm is kinda insufferable in the book version as he's obviously a mouthpiece for Crichton's somewhat luddite fears of scientific development. There's like a 10 page rant that's just pure Crichton spiel under the guise of Malcolm rambling while on morphine or whatever. He's got none of the charisma and swagger Goldblum imbues the character with in the film. You can kinda see the anti-science mentality Crichton had begun to develop emerge in novel Malcolm's rambling, and well Crichton's move into right wing alarmism and climate denialism is pretty well known. Film Malcolm instead spares the rants and condenses it down to a few punchy lines that don't make science out to be a foolish endeavor, but rather technological recklessness and corporate greed. 

I also think John Hammond is infinitely more interesting as a genuinely well intentioned but ultimately short-sighted overseer of the park instead of the fairly generic greedy corporate bastard he is in the novel. 

Overall, I prefer the character dynamics in the film script by a long shot. Lex in the novel is literally the most insufferable child character I think I've ever endured. Aging her up in the script was a great choice. 

Alan Grant gets a character arc in the film whereas he doesn't really have one in the novel. 

On the other hand I think the novel has a lot more cool and terrifying scenes involving the dinosaurs themselves, which I mean, to a degree obviously the book has far more time. Still, the tone of the novel is definitely more horrific overall. 

I think it's certainly worth reading both. I'd say the book has better atmosphere and dinosaur action/horror segments, but the character dynamics of the film are vastly superior. The film also, I feel, induces a much better sense of wonder and awe in the first half whereas the novel is much more horrific in tone. John William's music certainly helps in that regard.",,2023-11-17T16:01:25Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,18

7ua0t2_36,7ua0t2,"I am also reading the book for the first time after being a massive fan of the film for almost 30 years. Lex is literally nothing but a problem factory and by the way he wrote her it suggests to me that Michael Crichton really doesn't know much about kids or writing them. It read like how someone describes their friend's annoying kids.

There are other problems with the book, as well. I can think of half a dozen unnecessary detours (the egg hunt after everything is resolved comes to mind) and Ian Malcolm is insufferable. There is far too much rambling on about chaos theory and the attempts to control nature and how it goes awry. For one, books can communicate their themes without repeated long diatribes by characters who exist simply to spell this out. All that would have been necessary is Ian explaining chaos theory once, expressing his concerns once, and then letting the plot happen thus demonstrating what he says. This is how the film handles it and I think it's an improvement.

I think what you bring up regarding ai is interesting, and many books have been written in this general area (Neuromancer comes to mind). Despite my appreciation of chaos theory and the themes of the novel, I find Jurassic Park veered too much into the anti science area, especially since many of the major failings of the park in the novel are not inherent failures in design but instead characters making absurd errors (Arnold forgetting to switch on main power despite this being literally step one of the restart process).

I also take umbridge with the cynical tone of the book. It looks at nature as pure chaos, something almost destructive. The movie replaces this with wonder at nature, at its beauty and power, and I think that more effectively works with the themes of how egotistical we are to think we could possibly control and contain it.

This has turned into a long ramble about my thoughts on the book, so sorry. I just had these ideas on my mind and your thread prompted me to respond. ",JetJaguar124,2018-01-31T23:15:41Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,36

11yqman_3,11yqman,"I also appreciate how the film specifically takes Hammond's arc and twists it at the end in direct contrast to the book. (Thirty years, yet it's safe to say 'spoilers'.)

Novel Hammond's takeaway from the failure of the park was that things could be tweaked. That it could succeed were it done different. To blame everyone else for that failure, and in his fuming, ultimately meet his demise to the smallest of missteps.

Movie Hammond has the same opening persona. He's a businessman trying to make a buck, and this venture will be his magnum opus. He gleefully snickers at the ""coupon day"" quip. When everything is falling apart and Dr. Sattler talks to him, he tries to pull back into that same doom. That this is just an iteration to be built upon. ""When we have control-!""

Ellie brings him back to what's happening. He gets the human loss element that up until now hadn't risked his direct bloodline. And then from every scene onward we see him stepping back into the frame. Handing lines over. Finally, at the end, instead of saying, ""Next time,"" he agrees with Dr. Grant that Jurassic Park is not worth pursuing.

Since T2 was in post-production and Jurassic Park was in pre-production at the same time, the same shader that was used for the T-1000 was slapped onto the T-Rex to get the wet specular look they were going for. In a weird semi-accurate sense, the T-1000 was draped over the back of the T-Rex to make it look wet. While we did get the waterfall scene in Lost World, I wish we could see the raft scene.

11yqman_22,11yqman,"Hammond already owned and had stakes in various other lucrative ventures including theme parks in Kenya, Costa Rica, and other tropical locations before Jurassic Park. If The Lost World is any indication, we see that he is absolutely fine post Jurassic Park, financially. Sure, he financed and built the team that did something extraordinary, but Malcolm's entire dialogue in the lunch scene describes things best. 

>I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you're using here. It didn't require any discipline to attain it... you read what others had done, and you took the next step. You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunch box, and now you're selling it... your scientists were so preoccupied over whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

Hammond helped do something extraordinary, but it's not fair to give him sole credit. They piggy backed on years of work and research done by various other scientists before them. I don't think it's fair to say they stole it, but there are a lot of blurred lines. Beyond that, I'd argue there's a reason that Hammond went to Costa Rica. If we're bringing real world scenarios into things, I'd wager it's because the government is far less likely to interfere if you start doing genetic work than if they had tried to open the park in San Diego. A country like Costa Rica would likely even help with funding or something wherever they could, if they felt it would drive tourists and bolster the economy. 

At the end of the day, Hammond is a business man, not a scientist, a paleontologist, or in any position to be making logistical decision on something so grand. He did what businessmen do, cut costs to keep revenue high, and ultimately caused the massive chain of events in the film. Worst part is, in a real life scenario, all of this shit would be insured and he'd walk away even richer than before.",Thechosenjon,2023-03-23T16:52:33Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,22

The opening and ending chapter will be a beautifully written piece of sci-fi prose that eloquently establishes the world and characters.  The remainder of it reads like it's one step removed from being a screenplay instead of a novel.

3eprtw_2,3eprtw,"As an avid Crichton reader, I feel that over time there developed a subtle anti-science slant in Crichton's books that ultimately burst into conservative rhetoric like State of Fear. As a (environmental scientist) I also feel that Crichton played fast and loose with the science that he used in his books as well; Jurassic Park and Andromeda Stain are more *based* on science rather than reflective of it, as good as those books are.

A few quick things... Crichton was originally in med school, but then dropped out to start writing books. So that is where a lot of his technical/scientific background comes from. But after that experience, he turned towards the occult and new-age mysticism. You can read about this in his autobiography Travels, if you want to be frustrated. So over the course of his writing career he turned anti-science and, really, if you summarize 90% of his books, they almost all have scientists as the villains or antagonists, with ""we shouldn't have done that"" as the moral. And this culminated in books like Prey and State of Fear which are so anti-science as to feel more like far-right moralizing than his previous books like Jurassic Park. 

Anyway, my point is that I don't think his books have much place in a science classroom. Maybe Andromeda Strain, because it does get CDC containment protocols somewhat accurate. But in that case Hot Zone is better. ",astralkitty2501,2015-07-27T15:31:25Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,2

ynkgxd_1,ynkgxd,"The film flows better because it's a simplification of the book. But that same simplification also means it loses a lot of the refinement of the book.

The movie turns Hammond into a nice old man with bad luck instead of someone who is dead set on exploiting science for profit without any regard for the potential consequences.

Along the same lines, bringing a team of experts to the island had much more impact in the book than in the movie. In the movie they just spout some platitudes while running around. In the book they genuinely acted out of their expertise.

Book Malcolm's already figured out that the dinosaurs are breeding and running free before the tour event started. He reasons his way through all the logic mistakes the park has made that blinded them to realising shit's already fucked from the start in a matter of minutes.

Sattler's immediately noticing the complete lack of respect for the science of what they're doing when she points out they planted very toxic plants all around the resort pool just because it looks good.

Dr. Wu isn't just some mad scientist but someone whose in completely the wrong job. He's a geneticist forced to become a zookeeper. He's maintaining a zoo he completely doesn't understand because he only cares about the genetics, not the resulting animals. And he's happy to point that out to Hammond. Jurassic Park doesn't understand the animals it has because nobody cares about the animals.

Muldoon is the closest they have to someone like that and his advice is to kill them all with extreme prejudice. To the point where he wants heavy weaponry like grenade launchers on hand to do it.

And Hammond himself is so profit driven that all of the mistakes of Jurassic Park make much more sense. He formed the entire project around getting product to market as fast as possible with zero care or interest for obtaining the right expertise for doing it properly.

Even the lawyer is a decent guy as Gennaro sees through all of it and has every intention of shutting the place down as it's just a terrible investment with that many mistakes made.

The movie is fantastic but it's so simplified that everyone involved is just a superficial reflection of their book version, removing all their expert views on Jurassic Park that gave it a bit of depth.

As for Lex, she's a much younger child in the book. Hunger and fear would be the dominant driving force for a child that young. The kids only serve two purposes in the book.

They give Grant a reason traverse a significant part of the park. Grant's a survivalist, without the kids holding him back, he would have crossed the island in no time. The kids provided a lot of opportunity for drama. Grant got invited to the park for his palaeontology expertise but he's really in the story for his survival expertise, he's the character who can survive the island.

The second reason is that after the initial disaster, everyone's save. Grant and the kids are in a safe part of the park. The rest of the people are safe in the bunker. But Hammond doesn't want to lose his expensive animals to the lysine contingency plan. So he uses that fact that manipulate people into shutting down the fences and going into the park to safe them.

If it weren't for the kids, everyone would have told Hammond to fuck off. The dinosaurs would die on their own and the story would be over.",,2022-11-06T10:44:34Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,1
ynkgxd_2,ynkgxd,"Jurassic Park is my favorite novel of all time. I really think it’s perfection and while the movie is a masterpiece of 90’s Hollywood, I wish they could have included some of the missed scenes (which ended up in the Lost World and JP3 movies). Because I saw the movie first I imagine the characters as their screen version but I have some pretty wild visualizations of the events like Genarro and Muldoon riding in a jeep across the open Savannah to blow the leg off the Juvenile Trex with the laser guided rocket launcher (if I remember correctly) the sequence of navigating a small concrete power shed, plus the waterfall and aviary. The river scene really sticks out in my mind with the microceratops in the trees. Plus the iconic scene going underground to the Raptor’s den (which was explored in one of the Sega games I believe) and the bombing of the island. 

The big winner is Crichton’s prose on genetic engineering and biotechnology and while that was written in 1990 it holds up so true today. Genetic engineering is by far one of, if not the greatest technologies we have and it’s up to us to not allow it to spiral out of control. Of course we haven’t seen things like dinosaurs or other created monsters, but biotechnology with genetic manipulation is really at the forefront of a lot of issues today. 

Crichton was really ahead of his time, especially bringing issues like these to readers in the 90’s. Dare I say- he was a genius. Definitely my favorite author.",AngeloSantelli,2022-11-06T13:19:14Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,2
ynkgxd_3,ynkgxd,"I read Jurassic Park when I was 11 years old close to when it first came out then saw the movie when it was  released a year later. I revisited the book, and the sequel, a few weeks ago. My conclusion is that neither of them are good books. The characters are purposely dumb to enable them to make huge mistakes because that’s the only way to make Crichton’s view of human’s carelessness with “genetic power” work. 

The idea behind cloning dinosaurs is great but it’s as fragile as real cloned dinosaurs would be. So he has to create all these “failsafes”, mainly dumb or careless humans, to assure the dinosaurs can get the upper hand on the island. Like the island has no real security team to handle the dinosaurs and not even a doctor for people who get injured? On a remote island? Really? 

I will also still never in my life understand the strategy behind Nedry taking a 10 minute break to drive all the way to the port, during a huge storm. Taking the only gas powered Jeep on site. And somehow getting back without raising suspicion. That’s not even considering he turned off the fences for the animals, adding a level of danger that I’m sure his brilliant mind could have programmed around. That’s also one of the things they carried over from the movie without much alteration, also baffling. 

The movie is actually the better version, imo. It flows better, it’s more believable and the characters are better. Lex especially is far better than the godawful character that Lex in the book is. The Lost World movie is also a huge improvement over the book, which also uses a similar series of stupid mistakes to progress the story and feed into Crichton’s preachings. Crichton had really interesting ideas but I think the execution of those ideas has been hyped far beyond where they actually stand.",dinoroo,2022-11-06T08:50:28Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,3
ynkgxd_4,ynkgxd,"> it was more the actual prose style of his writing that I wasn’t a fan of. He did more telling than showing, which separates me from the realism of the story, and wrote in a passive voice much of the time, which weakens the impact of action.

No offense but this reads like first year university student complaints. Reddit has a hardon for the whole ""show don't tell"" cliche and pushes it far too much. The truth is Jurassic Park has a *ton* of action in it driving both the plot and the character development, so that criticism doesn't ring true at all. As for the passive voice, I don't see that either. If it's there to any extent, it's not significant enough to mention.

ynkgxd_6,ynkgxd,"Whenever I read a book, I don’t think to myself “let’s find some passive voice”. I am not a grammar or prose Nazi, and I have read many books, yet I have never made a post like this before. The passive voice stuck out to me that much while reading Jurassic Park. I’m sorry if you don’t like my criticism, but it is not false. And no, you don’t just rearrange a sentence with the same words to make it active. You find better words, especially better verbs.

Another thing Crichton did a lot was say “he heard” or “she saw”, which separates the reader from the description. Instead of “he heard his heart beating” it should be “his heart thundered in his ears.” See how much better that is? How it shows rather than tells? It brings you into the action as a reader rather than reading like a screenplay.

I’m looking at page 296 (I guess 265 for you) and I see 7 uses of passive voice on that page alone. The writing just isn’t great.

“Grant pulled one of the cubes out onto the dock. It was surprisingly heavy.”

Would sound better as

“Grant pulled one of the cubes onto the dock, his back straining with the weight.”

Anyway, there are a bunch of examples in this text. As for the tension example I gave, you wouldn’t just rearrange the same words, you would use stronger verbs, like the reworded example I gave in my previous comment. I’m not sure why you disregarded that.

It honestly seems like you took my criticism personally and you’re upset with me about it.",idrinkkombucha,2022-11-08T04:28:24Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,6
1372uv2_1,1372uv2,"I like how heavily the book emphasises. Hammond's hubris. The movie kind of glosses over this but in the book, everyone's much clearer on how bad of an idea this is and that makes them much stronger in their own expertise.

Malcolm figures out the dinosaurs have escaped and are reproducing minutes after arriving in the park by figuring out the flaws in the security system's logic.

Grant, Wu, Genaro, Muldoon and some of the others points out that they haven't made dinosaurs. They've taken so many shortcuts and made so many fixes that these creatures are something entirely new. 

I loved the angle that Wu is a geneticist who has lost interest in Jurassic Park because the genetic science challenge is over and now he's just a zookeeper who doesn't care about animals. While Muldoon points out that they're an animal park full of extremely dangerous animals while they can't be bothered to really learn what makes these animals tick. Which is why he wants very heavy weaponry but doesn't get it.

Ellie again points out the sheer disrespect for the power of nature when she discovers they lined the swimming pool area with extremely toxic plants.

The movie, understandably, has to condense the plot a lot. Which is also why Genaro looks so weak in the movie. The book has multiple tough guys wiling to get their hands dirty in Grant, Muldoon, Genaro, Ed Regis and so on. The movie combined Ed and Genero into the missing element, sleazy lawyer who pushed in favour of the park when the other characters were opposed.

And Hammond is so much sleazier in the book. He manipulates everyone. Even after the initial disaster when everyone is save, he uses his own kids to manipulate people into going out into the park to reset the power. Hammond's a massive dick in the book who only cares about money and capitalising on his investment. Very different from movie Hammond who is a dreamer.

And yeah, I also felt like the book should have ended when they got the park under control. The whole part about going out to the raptor nesting area felt like dragging out a story that already found it's ending.

233xtp_12,233xtp,"Here is my Jurassic park story. I was in the fifth grade. This was the first year we started switching classes for different subjects rather than everyone having the exact same classes all day long. I had been placed in the normal reading class. We began every day with silent reading and every kid in the class, it seemed, was reading either the Indian in the cupboard or one of the Fudge books. Up until that point, I was not much of a reader. Those same books had been read and re-read to us I don't know how many times and I was already burnt out on them.  I remember already hating the fudge books by the fourth grade. 

The movie had just come out and when I saw the book in the checkout line of the grocery store, I begged my parents to buy it for me. That book changed my life. It was the first book that ever truly grabbed me. I couldn't put it down and when I had to, I couldn't wait to get back to it. I was blown away to discover it was even better than the movie. I thought of it as the first ""real"" book I had ever read. 

 We had a student teacher at the time who would walk around the classroom to make sure we stayed on task. When she saw what I was reading she stopped and asked to see my book. It turns out she was also reading it. She checked to see how far along I was and then began grilling me on the story. At the time I thought she just wanted to talk about this awesome book but now I realize she was checking my comprehension.  Satisfied, she handed me back my book and went straight to the teacher. They talked for a few minutes and I remember her pointing towards me and both of them looking over at me several times over the next few minutes.  

The very next day, I was moved to the advanced reading class. The entire course of my education changed on that day because of that book and a student teacher who was paying attention. ",dreamingofinnisfree,2014-04-16T16:58:05Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,12

vgukr4_1,vgukr4,"""He probably read the wrong research paper,"" Malcolm said, shaking his head. ""There's been a theory going around that tyrannosaurs can only see movement. A guy named Roxton made casts of rex braincases and concluded that tyrannosaurs had the brain of a frog.""

...

The radio clicked again. ""Roxton,"" Levine said, ""believed that tyrannosaurs had a visual system like an amphibian: like a frog. A frog sees motion but doesn't see stillness. But it is quite impossible that a predator such as a tyrannosaur would have a visual system that worked that way. Quite impossible. Because the most common defense of prey animals is to freeze. A deer or something like that, it senses danger, and it freezes. A predator has to be able to see them anyway. And of course a tyrannosaur could.""

Over the radio, Levine snorted with disgust. ""It's just like the other idiotic theory put forth by Grant a few years back that a tyrannosaur could be confused by a driving rainstorm, because it was not adapted to wet climates. That's equally absurd. The Cretaceous wasn't particularly dry. And in any case, tyrannosaurs are North American animals -- they've only been found in the U.S. or Canada. Tyrannosaurs lived on the shores of the great inland sea, east of the Rocky Mountains. There are lots of thunderstorms on mountain slopes. I'm quite sure tyrannosaurs saw plenty of rain, and they evolved to deal with it.""

""So is there any reason why a tyrannosaur might not attack somebody?"" Malcolm asked.

""Yes, of course. The most obvious one,"" Levine said.

""Which is?""

""If it wasn't hungry. If it had just eaten another animal. Anything larger than a goat would take care of its hunger for hours to come. No, no. The Tyrannosaur sees fine, moving or still.

\--- The Lost World

It is a little odd that you would ask this, since this happens right after Dodgson is attacked. And the entire chapter after Dodgson is attacked is devoted to this discussion about why standing still didn't save Dodgson or Basleton.

Anyways, you can view it how you want. But it is important to remember that most of the scientific errors in Jurassic Park weren't scientific errors when it was written\*. Research in Dinosaurs slowed down in the 70s and 80s and Jurassic Park brought interest back into dinosaurs. This resulted in new discoveries which proved the books wrong.

I see it as Crighton acknowledging that the earlier book was wrong in a way that explains why he thought what he did. Note that the bad guy dies from bad science (the science that Crighton once believed) and the good guys mock the very idea that anyone would have ever believed that thing that Crighton believed.

\*There is a bit of a caveat here. Crighton wrote in many things that, at the time, were neither right nor wrong. That is, because we knew a lot less about dinosaurs at the time, there were a lot more things that could be true, and Crighton took many liberties inside that space.

If I believe this, I justify it that the park wasn’t opened yet and they were fine tuning the genetics on Sorna (the “factory floor” so to speak) and had produced a newer version but didn’t have it transported to the park yet. OR…. Maybe they didn’t intend to move that version of those rexes, since the T-Rex in the park would be easier to observe for guests, and so they kept the visually impaired Rex and discarded the other version for being too “reactive” to guests presence (if believing this shade of my theory, there’s justification in Lost World about the island being comprised of misfit versions of dinos).

15y1oj8_1,15y1oj8,"I think you missed his point a little bit.

>He describes that science builds on the shoulders of others meaning things that should not be done are done.

That's not what he says really. He states that science works by building on the work of the people who came before you. ie. a scientist stands on the shoulders of giants because he starts with the knowledge accumulated by his predecessors.

Malcolm points out that this means that scientists haven't *earned* that knowledge. They get the knowledge from the past without having paid the price or seen the consequences.

As a result they don't foresee the consequences of their own actions either. They don't feel responsible. Crichton isn't saying that things that shouldn't be done are done. He's saying people don't stop to think if they should or shouldn't.

>Scientists create things to achieve their own personal goals without thinking of larger consequences.

Again that's not what's happening. Henry Wu points out that he's a geneticist. His talents and interests lie in gene hacking and he happily took on the challenge of repairing dinosaur DNA.

But once the animals are born, Wu is the wrong person for the job. He's the first one to point out that he's not a zookeeper. He has no expertise in animal behaviour. He even points out that the animals he made are not dinosaurs because he changed the DNA.

A lot of the people involved in Jurassic Park point out that they're being used for the wrong job. They are absolutely thinking of the larger consequences but they're in the wrong spot for doing something about it.

Wu wants to make the animals more docile. Muldoon wants to have heavy weaponry so they can put the animals down if necessary. Harding points out that they shouldn't keep animals without any knowledge about how to care for them. Arnold and Nedry point out their infrastructure is shit and and needs more work.

But they're not listened to. It's not the specialists that are the problem. It's the people deciding how the science is implemented.

>it's end reminded me of AI very much.

There's no point in singling out AI really. Jurassic Park's message is just as true for medical science, climate science, food science and any other kind of science that affects people really.

Jurassic Park works so well because of how they use the CGI they had at the time - 

CGI dinos don't share major screen time with people, you don't see CGI dinos directly interact with people (those close up shots are puppet work), they're almost always in rapid motion, they're usually used in low light situations, are generally in distance shots, and it really helps that we don't know what dinosaurs should look like, so our brain is never subconsciously yelling ""that thing is a wrong thing!""",see-bees,2019-04-26T13:17:18Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,6

ndq9xw_2,ndq9xw,"*Jurassic Park* the book is extremely well done and you can read it over and over. *The Lost World* is better than the movie version, and actually explores some very interesting consequences of the Jurassic Park idea, which I won't spoil, but the point of the book is pretty interesting and completely ignored by the movie. *Sphere* was the first ""adult"" book I ever read and it is also a great psychological thriller.

1990s Crichton is full of page-turners. It's interesting that about half the time he ends up on the wrong side of history and really demonizes some particular group (the Japanese with Rising Sun, women in general with Disclosure). *Timeline* was a good read - the movie is pretty standard action fare, but the book is really an exploration of an interesting question - what if modern, capable people were transported to medieval times? Would they survive? Thrive? I think *Airframe* is underrated and one of Crichton's best; it's a realistic techno-thriller whodunit.  I'm surprised it hasn't been adapted yet. It would make a perfect limited series for Netflix or HBO.

2000s Crichton gets pretty pulpy. As others have pointed out, *State of Fear* is another wrong-side-of-history book. When you have a character that brings along a portable printer so that he can print out a bibliography for the other characters in between action scenes, you've pretty much bulldozed the fourth wall. Everybody loves *Prey* but it is SO pulpy and the misogyny vibe from *Disclosure* is super strong in that book. I'm currently 2/3 of the way through *Next* and nearly everyone in the book is a moustache-twirling villain of the most melodramatic kind.",DrFrylock,2021-05-17T06:08:15Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,2

Jurassic Park was fantastic in my opinion, with most of it being similar to the film but with a lot of extra exciting scenes that were never adapted into the first film.  It was interesting to me that elements of that one book have been taken and applied to the Jurassic Park sequels and other media: the compy scenes were included in the Lost World film, the pterodactyls were included in Jurassic Park 3 and Jurassic World,  Dr Wu being kind of evil/ambitious and altering the genes of dinosaurs to have certain traits are in Jurassic World, and the river raft scene became the Jurassic Park ride at Universal Studios.  It's like it took four movies and a theme park ride to adapt most of the book, and there are *still* scenes that haven't been translated to film (the T-Rex in the water scene, for example).

The Lost World is probably worth a read, but it just wasn't as engaging for me.  A lot of it seems to be a retread of the first novel's story, but it's an inferior version.  It's so different from the film that it's hard to really compare the two.

3i2s27_3,3i2s27,"

I was really young when Jurassic Park originally came out and I read it then but didn't understand a lot of its concepts at the time.  I recently reread it as well and I'll have to say that Jurassic Park was an excellent novel but Lost World seemed to be in a different ballpark.  Jurassic Park explored the idea of chaos in a controlled system.  It set the precedent for the Jurassic Park characters that they are today.  Grant is the Indiana Jones style archaeologist and Ian Malcolm was spouting these mathematical theories that made him the ""Johnny Cash"" of mathematics that he is.  In Lost World, I felt all those ideas were shattered.  It seemed the stereotypical action thriller that kept me going, but I felt as though it could have been anyone else writing that thriller and it wouldn't have been any better.  It felt generic and bland. 

***SPOILERS***



Ian Malcolm became this odd morphine rambling addict in the end that sort of had a message but not enough that I keep an interest in.  The raptors became these prion infested creatures that shattered the idea of the coordinated attack group that was set up in Jurassic Park.  I thought it was entertaining as a book, but Lost World was very much an entertaining ""airplane read"" style book compared to Jurassic Park in my opinion.",diastrad107,2015-08-24T08:25:35Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,3

14wykcd_3,14wykcd,"I echo your view of *1984,* a tremendous story, beautifully expressed. The narrative is so compelling and well-constructed, the prose is smooth and crystal clear, and for all its horror there's a lot of deliciously mordant humor (the cafeteria scene with the secondary characters is one of the funniest). The INGSOC world with its debasement of the language, the concept of 'whoever controls the past controls the present', and Goldstein's book, is an incredibly insightful creation, even in spite of the implausibilities. I first read it when I was 13 or 14, and it's still, many years later, one of the very best novels I've read. I saw Michael Radford's film with John Hurt in the year 1984, finding every role perfectly cast and the production design suitably grim, completely convincing. Saw it again recently and it's lost none of its power. Orwell was dying when he wrote it, I believe, and he was hitting the peak of his creativity despite his mortal illness. The final scenes with Winston and O'Brien are so chilling and riveting. It's one of those rare novels, in my experience, that's as entertaining as it is relevant. Orwell was one of the great English stylists because his style is so unobtrusive and 'obvious' it seems no effort at all to carry off (like Mario Puzo, another storytelling genius derided by those who expect great novels to be written in a more flashy 'literary' style, cleverness for its own sake). Any writer can learn a lot from Orwell about how to make the reader a trusted and respected confidant.

*Jurassic Park* I haven't read, although I started *The Lost World* but let it lapse. I must finish it because I rate Michael Crichton very highly from his screen adaptations.

14fs248_1,14fs248,"If I remember correctly once the power was back on and they were able to radio the supply ship the crew discovered and killed the juvenile Raptor stowaways and had radioed back with that information. It wasn't quite at the end of the book, I think it just after they got the power back on and before they set out to destroy the Raptor nests.  


However, it was made clear that there were dinosaurs that had escaped the island prior to this. It was implied the juvenile Raptors had been slipping out of the Raptor enclosure for some time. Due to their small size they were able to slip out of the enclosures even though the fences were electrified, and the total lack of monitoring they were able to make their way onto the supply ships when they were docked, and follow their migratory instinct. This was probably how the Compsognathus from the beginning of the book had made it off Isla Nublar, since the Compys were able to cross through enclosures unimpeded for the same reasons. No one was aware of the additional dinosaurs since the monitoring program wasn't counting the additional dinosaurs until they'd fixed it, so it wasn't clear to anyone how long the dinosaurs had been making their way off the island, or how many. We do know from the end of the book that there are rumors of a pack of lizard like animals eating lysine rich crops and killing livestock while migrating their way into the jungles of Costa Rica. It's possible it was just more Compsognathus, but it's possible it was Raptors as well.  
Without spoiling anything about the second book it does allude to dinosaurs possibly existing off of the island, but its functionally a thread that leads the story back to Ingen and Jurassic Park.",redlettergreenletter,2023-06-22T06:45:39Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,1

Sadly, when I was younger I had a negative/apathetic outlook toward my education, so I mostly resented reading because I was forced to do it in school. Even good books like *The Great Gatsby* and *Animal Farm* were impossible for me to enjoy because of my bad attitude. Then, in my senior year of high school, I had an English teacher who let us read whatever we wanted. My dad owns both of the *Jurassic Park* books, and I liked the movies, so I figured what the hell I'll read that. I loved it. Afterward I read Tom Clancy's *Rainbow Six* after a friend recommended it, and I loved that as well.

I feell like Chricton thinks he's smarter than he is. He thinks his twists and turns are hard to predict or understand, so he writes his characters that way.

7pkhp6_1,7pkhp6,"I loved both the book and movie pretty equally.  *Jurassic Park* is one of the few movies where I didn't mind how much it deviated from the book.  It's good as a standalone.

I really enjoyed Crichton novels.  They're by no means classic literature and he's not the best writer, but they all had really interesting ideas and kept my attention really well.

My complaints with Crichton are:

* He couldn't write a decent female character.  Every book seems to have that young, blonde, sexy, drop-dead-gorgeous female scientist who's a genius in her field and graduated very young.  After a few books you'll realize that Ellie is just a clone of every Crichton female.  

* He couldn't write dialogue involving very young kids (whenever any character has a young child, we get treated to toddler baby-talk coming out of a four-year-old).

* He couldn't work his research into the story very well.  He did *a lot* of research on anything he wrote, which is great, but every single book ended up having a sudden break in the story for a five page virtual monologue from a scientist character who would explain everything to the reader.  This was done by having the scientist explain it to another character, almost non-stop.  The character receiving the lecture would say an occasional, ""okay"" or ask a question (""well how would that work?"") and then the scientist would get going for another two pages.  Now, honestly, it would be interesting stuff, but it was a really lazy way to introduce all the science behind the main plot.

So, while some of his weak points drove me crazy and I didn't consider him to be the most talented writer, I really did enjoy his books and got excited for each new one that came out.  I'd recommend you try some others (*The Andromeda* and *Sphere* would be good choices as well as *The Lost World*.)",ConstantReader76,2018-01-11T04:26:26Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,1

Normally we reserve our excuses for ""bunky"" science for sci-fi stories that take place in space, but I love that Crichton (who had an extensive medical background) took a lot of very real science and expanded on it with his imagination alone to tell a REALLY exciting story.

Ironically, I feel that Jurassic Park 3 is the most like Crichton's novels. Maybe the aviary scenes help.

m69r7w_3,m69r7w,"I don't think Crichton was like King at all. 

Crichton went to med school before writing and his attention to detail and scientific curiosity drove his work. He did not self-insert, was in a completely different genre, different writing style, and nowhere near as large of bibliography as King. I have no earthly idea what would drive anyone to compare the two. I have heard him compared to technothriller authors like Dan Brown -- generally pointing out his superiority in plausibly and lauding his research. The martian has a similar energy to me.  

As for the writing, I have always found that sci-fi as a genre suffers from particularly bad writing (herbert and scalzi come to mind). His type of ""realistic"" sci-fi also ages poorly. The usual defense is that its about the ideas rather than the prose, character, or plot. I'm feel like that is just making excuses. It's possible to have  good idea and write good book instead of lowering the bar. Whatever. I agree that quite a few of his books feel formulic in format and are dreadfully boring.


My favorites are Sphere, Jurassic Park, and A Case for Need. I thought Timeline was a cool idea but a boring book. Congo has aged poorly.",pineapplesf,2021-03-16T15:10:48Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,3

Fractals exist in euclidean space, and sure, you can say they're not ""ordinary"" euclidean spaces, and I would be cool with that.  But then he cites spheres as an example of ""ordinary"" euclidean space.  They're not even a bit of a special case like fractals--  the surface of a sphere is straight up non-euclidean!

I don't expect authors to always nail this sort of thing, and I can gloss over it a bit, but Malcolm honestly comes across like a kid that got stoned in math class and it makes his character kinda laughable.

o4pexk_3,o4pexk,"I loved Crichton when I was a kid/teen, but I haven't read any of his books for 15 years or so. A couple of weeks ago I decided to give a go to Jurassic Park (arguably his most famous) and Sphere (my old favorite).

I finished Jurassic Park yesterday, and I was disappointed. I wished I loved it as much as when I was a kid. It fared far better in my memory. Today I can say that the movie is significantly better, even story-wise. The best thing I can take from the book is that:

1) It's very easy to read. I think there were only 1-2 words I didn't know the meaning of, and the language and sentence structures are super simple. I don't particularly enjoy simplicity now, but I can see why this wasn't an issue during my teen years.

2) It is a page turner. It's 100% pure action/thrill, and it is up to the reader to fill in all the details. Mind, however, that my previous book was Moby Dick so probably anything other than a Greek tragedy was going to feel that way :D

&#x200B;

There were many things I didn't like unfortunately, with the most important ones being: It's mostly ""tell, don't show"", the POV characters are all over the place too fast, a lot of dialog lines feel pointless / serve no purpose, some character decisions are too stupid to feel real (a pet peeve of mine).

It feels more like a script than a novel._x000D_  


I recently started writing again, and have been reading several books on the craft. Jurassic Park does not follow a lot of the usual advice. In a way, it is a good example on how you don't really need to follow all those ""rules"" in order for a book to be successful (though one must remember Crichton was already an accomplished brand by the time he released JP).

&#x200B;

Nonetheless, the main reason I'm writing this is because as soon as I wrapped up Jurassic Park, I started Sphere. Read around 10% already, and it's already ***significantly better***. Can't speak for the rest of the book yet, but I have hopes I'm going to like it.

So don't get discouraged by Jurassic Park, hopefully you'll like Sphere!

dsgs8n_4,dsgs8n,"I thought the book was terrible in its treatment of science, but I enjoyed it anyway because I like dinosaurs.

I'm not sure why people imagine he did a great deal of research before writing *Jurassic Park*. Perhaps they don't remember the context of when this book was written. The fact is that chaos theory was making the rounds in the popular press in those days, with truckloads of fanciful articles in *Time*, *Popular Science*, *Popular Mechanics*, etc. It all came to a head with the publication of the book [Chaos: Making a New Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science) by James Gleick, which was published in 1987, three years before *Jurassic Park*. This book made the NY Times bestsellers list, was nominated for the Pulitzer, the Science Book Prize, and a bunch of others.

I would say that 90% of Crichton's ramblings in *Jurassic Park* are directly taken from Gleick's book, including all the examples by his mathematician, Ian Malcolm. But unfortunately, Crichton failed to understand what chaos theory actually says, and his idea that the park was bound to fail because humans couldn't predict the complex interplay of all the variables, was ludicrously stupid. That is not what chaos theory says *at all*.

There are, in fact, lots of examples of complex systems that are too complex to model even on the most powerful computers that we **use all the time**. For example, airflow over a wing. That's why wind tunnels exist, because the Navier-Stokes equations get really nasty, and the only reliable way to solve the problem is to build the model and see what happens. Which we've been doing since the Wright Brothers, and billions of people have flown safely on airplanes despite the chaos theory.

I was shocked at how stupidly he deals with his chaos theory interpretation of the park's breakdown. The ""unexpected"" features that are supposedly too chaotic to be predicted. Like a crooked engineer taking money to steal embryos and therefore shut down electric fences (Dennis Nedry). I mean, come on, if having good security to the point that one unsupervised person can't fuck up your entire park is so hard, how does the military work? How does any complex project work, whether it's building a power plant or a factory? There's a whole science dedicated to avoiding single points of failure.

Or the ""unexpected"" result that using frog DNA to patch your dino DNA makes animals able to change their sex and lay eggs when they weren't supposed to. It would make any biologist cringe. Isn't it enough that we're being asked to suspend disbelief long enough to say ""okay, I won't object when you claim that frog DNA can replace dino DNA"", a completely stupid idea? Now we have to believe that there is something magical about frog DNA that allows sex changes in dinosaurs? And this completely made-up detail somehow supports that chaos theory ordains that parks are bound to fail when man's hubris dares to bring dead dinos back to life?

The ""science"" of *Jurassic Park* was shitty beyond belief. Unfortunately, Crichton didn't realize how shitty t was, so in his hubris he kept on adding detail that would make it shittier to anyone who actually understood the subject. Another example. He pastes a crapload of computer ""code"" that's supposed to make the book more realistic when he's talking about how Nedry sabotages the computers. It might have impressed people back in 1990 when fewer people understood programming, but it must have made real programmers cringe when they saw all those GOTO statements. Even a novice programmer knows that professionals don't use GOTO's, it fucks up your code with arbitrary jumps from one point to another. Like [this XKCD comic](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/7a/goto.png) that show what happens when you use a ""GOTO"" - a fucking velociraptor jumps on you and eats you.

Crichton's books have always been cringeworthy when it comes to science, and he was completely oblivious to it. Like when he writes a whole fucking tome masquerading as a novel ([State of Fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Fear#Criticism_from_scientific_community)) to deny climate change. While thinking that he was smarter than thousands of climate scientists whose work he misunderstood and misrepresented so fucking confidently. Crichton was a prime example of [Dunning Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), someone too ignorant to realize the extent of his own ignorance.

That said, he was a good storyteller, and I've enjoyed many of his books for the stories alone. But I find it uncomfortable when people praise his science, because his science sucked.",Valmyr5,2019-11-07T08:11:51Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,4

Because he did do a great deal of research. Read or watch some of his interviews. I cannot think of a single writer that researched his books more than Crichton did. He spent years doing research before he even started writing.

>The ""science"" of Jurassic Park was shitty beyond belief.

That may be true, but you haven't shown that with your examples. I'm still waiting for you to expand on how and why he was wrong in his interpretation of Chaos Theory and yes I read every word you just wrote. If you don't want to take the time to explain as would usually be the case on reddit that is fine, but I will have to take your assertions as intriguing but unproven.

>I would say that 90% of Crichton's ramblings in Jurassic Park are directly taken from Gleick's book

He was an (unlicensed) doctor and a novelist. Not a mathematician. Where would you expect him to get his knowledge of Chaos Theory from? And he does not only write about Chaos Theory.

>Another example. He pastes a crapload of computer ""code"" that's supposed to make the book more realistic when he's talking about how Nedry sabotages the computers. It might have impressed people back in 1990 when fewer people understood programming

I'm sorry. Did you really just say that people did not understand programming in 1990 as well as they do now? Are you serious? If anything I think today's programmers understand even less about what they are really doing than they did then. 

I am a programmer myself and the code was actually ok in my opinion. I don't use goto statements myself but they can have limited use when necessary. It isn't an example of bad science to post code with goto statements. I am confident that Crichton actually knew that programmers had not really routinely used goto statements since the early 80s. He was highly intelligent. 

It has been a while since I've read the novel and I can't remember the code exactly though. Some of it may have been embedded programming or disassembled C code which would be more likely to have direct code jumps.

>Crichton's books have always been cringeworthy when it comes to science, and he was completely oblivious to it.

I disagree. Maybe he misapplied Chaos Theory a bit although you still haven't specified exactly how but generally his science is pretty good. Not perfect, but generally much better than other science fiction or tech authors I have read. That would be because he was highly intelligent and did years of research on a topic before starting to write.

>Like when he writes a whole fucking tome masquerading as a novel (State of Fear) to deny climate change.

Ok Millennial. I see. He triggered you. He is your political enemy, and I think you are letting your bias get in the way of judging his work fairly.

>Crichton was a prime example of Dunning Kruger, someone too ignorant to realize the extent of his own ignorance.

Not true. Harvard students are very rarely good examples of Dunning Kruger. They tend to be intelligent enough not to fall into that trap. I think Crichton demonstrated his abilities quite well, and I see no evidence of arrogance or overestimation of his abilities. In fact he was often self-deprecating when discussing his own fiction admitting for instance that he was not good at writing characters. For me that was the worst part of his writing: his characters were often shallow to the point of being cardboard stereotype placeholders.",headhuntermomo,2019-11-08T14:47:59Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,6

I also think it taps into a different vibe than Jurassic Park: JP is about humans trying to exploit nature (and losing control), The Lost World is about humans trying to explore nature (and losing control).

Lost World has a more coherent cast of characters, and it employs the thing I like most in pulp - characters doing logical things smartly instead of being dumb/ignorant for the sake of plot.

The things they do in Lost World read like they've actually seen the movie Jurassic Park. They come afoul of things unseen, not dumb genre cliches. That's refreshing.",,2014-03-02T19:38:41Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,4

4y60m0_1,4y60m0,"To be fair, the use of chaos theory to explain the problems in Hammond's park was pretty much bullshit.

Yes, chaos theory is about small differences in initial conditions having a large impact on final results, but:

1. Not all systems are subject to this. Consider dropping a marble into an empty swimming pool. I don't care what initial conditions you use--where you drop the marble, exactly, or from how high you drop it, or even if you kind of throw it in there at an angle--the marble is going to end up down at the lowest point in the pool. This is not a chaotic system.
2. Crichton used it in the story pretty much because at that time, chaos theory was the new hawtness in popular science, so basically it sounded cool. But the story makes no effort to justify the use of chaos theory as an explanatory mechanism, nor to establish that the system in question (dinosaurs + the park's containment systems + a big storm) constitutes a system that exhibits chaotic behavior.

Edit: RE /u/thegingermullet's explanation: yes, the characters' ""small"" decisions ended up having big consequences, but Crichton's attempt to use chaos theory as the explanation for why that happened was misguided. The story shows us cases of intentional *choices* going awry. Chaos theory is about systems where you cannot predict the outcome from the initial conditions because the system is so sensitive to the exact initial conditions that you can neither *measure* them accurately enough to get a good long-term prediction, nor *reproduce* them accurately enough on subsequent trials. In the case of Jurassic Park's park, the situation was more that nobody even had a theoretical model of the system's dynamic behavior to begin with, and thus, nobody could predict what would happen anyway. That you had a bunch of pesky human actors in the mix, throwing in their own random choices and perturbations to the system certainly doesn't help, but that's not the same thing a chaos theory.",p2p_editor,2016-08-17T16:39:42Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Jurassic Park,1
