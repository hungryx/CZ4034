6kt05j_1,6kt05j,"There's a certain brand of languorous English wit and humor born of the largely-comfortable Victorian or Edwardian middle class and largely-idle lower aristocracy.  Wodehouse has already been mentioned alongside Jerome--I'd add Oscar Wilde's plays, and perhaps the best comparison to *Three Men In A Boat* in terms of hilarious travel adventure, *The Pickwick Papers*.

[Edit to remove ""upper"" before ""middle class""].",Inkberrow,2017-07-02T14:39:34Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Three Men in a Boat,1
6kt05j_2,6kt05j,Three Men in a Boat is the book that caused me to respect the classics. That something over a century old could be still as relatable and funny was astonishing to me. I've never laughed harder at a book to this day as when the protagonist is recalling his uncles (? It's been a few years since I've last read it) monologue to his family as he tried to hang up a painting.,,2017-07-02T17:19:25Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Three Men in a Boat,2

6kt05j_4,6kt05j,"There was a Fark thread about 12 years ago that I read of people's recommendations for the funniest books ever. Between this and A Confederacy of Dunces, I actually remember that thread because it introduced me to both. I tried to read Confederacy on a plane and had to pack it back away because I kept having to stifle my guffaws.

The Wind in the Willows is definitely very amusing and has a similar kind of voice. I also happen to love the original Winnie-the-Pooh books because although for children, they also have the same kind of sly and self-deprecating English humor in many ways, and the use of capital letters is kind of like the way people talk on the internet.

My Life and Hard Times by James Thurber is also excellent, short, and hilarious. The same sense of ""how was this written nearly 100 years ago"" feel - I still remember lines of it for their brilliance.

While I love pretty much everything Douglas Adams has written, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, while not laugh-out-loud funny, also has the same sort of bemused and English humor.

My favorite Oscar Wilde play is The Importance of Being Earnest, which reads very much like Three Men in a Boat's narrator. I go see this every time it's performed near me, and it's one of the only plays where I can read the script over and over and get just as much enjoyment and giggles as the first time. Unless you count The Santaland Diaries by David Sedaris, which now that I think of it also still cracks me up.",,2017-07-02T15:22:13Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Three Men in a Boat,4
6kt05j_5,6kt05j,"It's an amazing book and I'm glad we got to read in school. The problem was that in Russia (where I went to school) the book is called ""Three in a boat, if you don't count the dog"", which completely ruins the very first joke. It's supposed to be a surprise: ""three men in a boat"", you open up the first page - it says ""there were four of us""",malibu45,2017-07-02T16:37:21Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Three Men in a Boat,5
6kt05j_6,6kt05j,"If you liked 'Three Men In A Boat', you might like - from the same period 'Diary of a Nobody' by Weedon Grossmith. It's a 'show about nothing' a hundred years before the real show about nothing.",quyax,2017-07-02T14:24:19Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Three Men in a Boat,6

6kt05j_8,6kt05j,"Have you read An Infinite Jest or A Confederacy of Dunces? Not nearly as old as Three Men but also with humor that stands up really well.

If you enjoy humorous fantasy at all, my first book 'The Dungeoneers' is available for [free](http://www.jefferyrussell.net/) right now. You can check the reviews on Amazon or [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25971497) to see if it looks like your kind of deal.

No, it's not as good as Three Men in a Boat but a fair number of folk seem to have enjoyed it.

6kt05j_9,6kt05j,"The book inspired Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham's uncle to open a bar by the same name in the Midlands. Robert Plant also lived on the site for a time. 

If you've ever heard the story about Peter Grant and Jimmy Page sending dozens of telegrams to a house to try and get Bonham to join Led Zeppelin... Three Men in a Boat is the name of the bar they were sending 'em to.

6kt05j_10,6kt05j,"The name suggests that the novel is an allusion to the book, whose full title is ""Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)"". Which is way better than going with ""Three men in a ___"" :)

Loved the book, going to read this novel too!

As a side note, the sequel to Three Men in a Boat - Three Men on the Bummel - is great as well. It's about the three men cycling across Germany on one bike and one tandem, and I'm guessing it's not as popular because nobody knows what the Bummel is!

6kt05j_17,6kt05j,"If you like this, you'd also like ""An Invalid's Tale"" by Mark Twain.  He is bringing his friend's body back home in a railway carriage, but there is an error and the wrong crate is in the car; a shipment of cheese is involved.  It's written in a droll, mournful style that had me laughing.

Jerome K Jerome also wrote ""Three Men on The Bummel,"" a book in which the guys try again to go on vacation, this time on bicycles.  It's almost as funny as ""Three Men in a Boat.""",bobk2,2017-07-02T19:33:16Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Three Men in a Boat,17

6kt05j_19,6kt05j,"Currently reading bellweather to my son :) he's loving it :) reminds him of 'all seated on the ground' one of her shorter novellas about Christmas... it's the chaotic madness where she finds the humor... the absurdity of our hectic lives....

As for the others, they each have their own special place... I adore all of her oxford time travel stories... doomsday broke my heart... and yet she was able to bring in moments of hilarity even there.... 

To say nothing of the dog is one I seem to return to over and over... sweet, funny, charming... it's absolutely delightful... 

And I think this summer I'll finally read three men in a boat.... been meaning to for years :)",tkingsbu,2017-07-02T18:54:16Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Three Men in a Boat,19
