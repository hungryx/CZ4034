wabe7o_5,wabe7o,"The Gunslinger is one of the first books he wrote in the late 70s and it shows. Its a fascinating story with good characters and lore but his prose are dull. His run on sentences are rife and the pacing is just weird. Its not a bad book but the series does improve.

Gunslinger - 2/5

Drawing of the three -  5/5 (the additional world building, new characters and the main crux of the story that I won't spoil are all superb)

The Waste Lands - 3/5 (more world building but it dddddraaaaggggsssss)

Wizard and Glass - 4/5 (excellent explanation into the why of Roland but overlong)

Wind through the keyhole - ? (Haven't read it yet. I went through the collection a few years before it released)

Wolves of the calla - 3/5 (excellent story again but doesn't feel that connected to the main plot)

Song of Susssnah - 2/5 (I can't explain what happened here. Everything involved effects the main story but its all done in such a bland and uninspiring way. A mess! 

The dark tower -  4/5 (suitably epic finale with a few glaring problems. However, I won't say anymore as the series as a while is a mammoth undertaking and I don't want to spoil)

Overall id say worth going through if you're a keen reader but not his best work overall. That crown sits firmly on the stands head",,2022-07-28T16:56:56Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,5

wabe7o_8,wabe7o,"Book 4 in the series is probably the best but each is great in its own right. I was like you and really enjoyed the gunslinger. Just be aware that the series goes off the deep end starting in the next novel. 

I'd advise reading The Stand before you get to book 4. It is tangentially related and a phenomenal epic in its own right. 

Other King stuff is great as well. The shining in particular is an amazing look at addiction. 

King is one of those authors that certainly has some weakness but you can't help but be in awe at his ability to craft a flat out engaging narrative that just propels you through the pages.",marbanasin,2022-07-29T03:20:23Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,8
wabe7o_9,wabe7o,"I also love ""The Gunslinger"" rather than considering it a slog. 

FYI , OP , at one point King ""polished"" the book not only for continuity but also did a light rewrite. 

Personally , I vastly prefer the version from before he changed it. It was more spare , more sparse. I feel that he overwrote it when he went back to it. 

Reading the older version might be interesting to you at some point.",thewhitecat55,2022-07-28T17:56:35Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,9

wabe7o_11,wabe7o,"I’ve read/listened to the whole series many times. It’s so good. The gunslinger is just the start of your journey. 

I was looking for a podcast about the dark tower and found the kingslingers. I love it. You should check them out. It’s two guys. One is an avid King reader and is very knowledgeable about the Dark Tower series. The other has never read the Dark Tower, and has only read a few of Kings books. The format is that they read maybe 1-3 chapters each week and talk about it. The one guy that knows all about the Dark Tower books try’s not to spoil anything to the other guy. So you could read along with them and listen to the podcast when applicable. I think it’s about two years old, so they have finished all the books.",Humpadilo,2022-07-28T18:21:20Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,11
wabe7o_12,wabe7o,"I am not the biggest fan of King, specifically because of his dialogue, which is why the Gunslinger was such a surprise.  I figured out that it is his modern American I don't care for, which is not very modern and regionally incompatible with my ears, but his fantasy prose is so good.  I would love to read all of these again.  The ending is maybe controversial.  On one had, it won't be what you are expecting, but it's one of those things that starts to make sense over time, and then you realize it had to be that way.",ChronoMonkeyX,2022-07-28T18:38:18Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,12

I read The Gunslinger when I was in school twenty years ago, but found it confusing and didn’t like it a lot. I’m a big King fan though, and bought the boxed set.

wabe7o_17,wabe7o,"You might be like me, and if so, welcome to the minority.

I loved The Gunslinger. The tone, the desolation, the weird west mysticism all hit me perfectly. King took a long time before he wrote the second book, which takes everything in a pretty different direction, and the subsequent books go from there. I found stuff I liked in all of them, but there was a magic to The Gunslinger that really stood on its own to me.",StarSpongledDongle,2022-07-28T22:33:17Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,17

I absolutely was enraptured by the expansiveness of the settings and the depths of the characters. I was scared, turned on, and exceptionally existential all at the same time. I'm extremely excited to dive into the rest of The Dark Tower series and I think the ending provided a perfect set up to anticipate the rest of the journey.",SmokedCheddarGoblin,2022-07-28T22:36:38Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,18
wabe7o_19,wabe7o,"For reference: I loved the first book but quit the series part way through, as its tone changes dramatically.

Personally I loved the first book the most because >!it really felt like ""the gunslinger's"" quest was really important; he's going to kill all those people in that town to complete it, not because he wants to or because he started that situation, but because the quest is actually more important to him than that set of consequences, this gives him a firm sense of character and a morally grey one at that. It's also the most despicable The Man in Black ever feels, a truly evil character using trickery and death to try and accomplish his goals. Two: in the first book the protagonist wasn't invincible and he knew it. Of course he let Jake die in the middle of that mutant filled cave of horrors. It's not what ""story hero"" would do, but it is what a ""person"" would do. I think that's the major difference in the protagonist by the third book. Suddenly he's a ""story hero"" I have a much harder time relating too, because of course he'd consider going into a suicidal situation to save some kid he just met as it's ""the right thing to do"" and besides he's got plot armor right, cause he's in as story.!<",FranticPonE,2022-07-28T23:25:42Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,19
wabe7o_20,wabe7o,"The Gunslinger is one of my top 10 favs of all time. ""The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed"". Hooks me instantly every time I re-read. The gorgeous flow of the writing brings out the desert landscape in the story in my mind. I love the first 4 or 5 books. Not going to lie though, the ending of the series pissed me right the fuck off.

It inspired me to attempt to read the TS Elliot poem that is quoted at the front of the book, The Wasteland, I think. Yikes. My brain.

I was SO stoked about the film, however, after seeing the first trailer I almost cried and have refused to watch it.

I hope someday some big streaming service or channel with tons of resources (hello HBO you there?) decides to make it into an intricate several seasons-long show.",rmarocksanne,2022-07-28T23:33:35Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,20
wabe7o_21,wabe7o,"The Dark Tower is my favorite series of all time. The Gunslinger is probably one of my favorite books of all time. 

The series gets really fucking weird at times, which I think is awesome. It's drawn criticism for some narrative choices, most of which I disagree with, because those often seem to disregard the entire premise of the series. 

I loved the end. I thought it was perfect. I think King has an undeserved reputation for unsatisfying endings because the complaints are from a vocal group who want a neat, Hollywood, all questions answered ending, and that's often not how literature works. It's not how art works. 

I hope you are able to read and enjoy the whole thing, and the ending hits like it should. 

I feel like if you don't like the endings of critically acclaimed series and movies, for instance, The Sopranos, you won't like the ending of this. I've found the people who complain about one often complain about the other. In my opinion they're both masterpieces.",hereticjones,2022-07-29T00:15:26Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,21
wabe7o_22,wabe7o,"I was on a road trip in Colorado. I stopped in a little coffee shop which had what looked like a library in the front. It was odd, but it looked so cozy and nice either way. I learned after ordering my coffee that it was a ""take a book or leave a book..whatever you want to do"" situation. I was so surprised. I had never seen such a thing. Especially not one of this size. I browsed a bit and came across the first dark tower book. I always enjoyed Stephen King books, and I'd heard only passing reference to the gunslinger. My brother is a gigantic fan of SK, and the book had these really amazing painted scenes of the book in it. So I chose that one so I could give it to him later. I began reading it in the coffee shop. I only got a couple pages in before we got back in the car. I read that book through 2 states because I couldn't put it down. Once I got home from my trip, I quickly gathered the rest so I could binge read them. Really amazing series of books. I'm another who refused to watch the movie. I knew from seeing the trailer that I wouldn't like it. (No Thankee Sai! ) I hope you enjoy the rest of them as much as that first one.

wabe7o_25,wabe7o,"Looks like someone's on the path to becoming a Tower Junkie! 

I haven't met too many Tower fans IRL, but that idea of ""you just get through"" The Gunslinger that I see online baffles me. I finished that book by the second day I'd had it checked out from my HS library freshman year, could not put it down. Thoroughly enjoyed and loved every book; don't let the differing opinions on certain books tarnish your journey through them. And when you finish book 4, check out the comics - while the art style is kinda hard on the eyes IMHO it's cool seeing things from Roland's past fleshed out more.

I honestly didn't love The Gunslinger the first time I read it but The Drawing of the Three hooked me in the first 5 minutes. After that I was all in. My favorite book is Wizard and Glass, so much so that I might rank it in my top five favorite books of all time. It's certainly my favorite love story. If you are into audible I can't recommend the audiobooks enough. George Guidall does a great job but three of them are read by Frank Mueller and in my opinion he is the GOAT.

wabe7o_28,wabe7o,"It is an awesome book, and awesome series. The last few get a bit weird. 

People shit on King... He is a victim of his own success. I.e. he is so damned popular that people can't help but hate on him, for the same reason the hate on... Sinatra or Spielberg. 

yes, some of his novels have shitty endings... but he has over THIRTY novels. And they are all GOOD. Some are fucking great. Some are worse than others... but his consistency is incredible. 

Okay, that aside. Let's talk about the Gunslinger. 

You make a really interesting point of ""so many directions it can go."" You are right. That first book REALLY paints a broad picture, and leaves a wonderful, open-ended world and story. It has potentially deep context and you can read it as literature, and really explore some deeper themes and take a lot out of it. 

To be fair, it would all be... death of the author. I am almost 100% convinced any deep literary themes you wanted to import into it would not be from King, though. That isn't his style. He writes real, compelling characters and uses them to tell stories of fantastic plots. Any kind of deeper meaning you would want to draw out of them would be similar to any deeper meaning you would gather from real life... e.g. it would be you projecting onto the universe. 

Now, that doesn't mean you should give up on it. It just is what it is. Death of the Author is needed to give any deeper meaning to anything from King, is all I mean. 

Ok. So we have that out of the way... let's talk about the rest of the Dark Tower. Fucking A it is a good ride. Like, an awesome one. Books 2/3/4 are some of the best fucking fiction out there. Like DAMN! Book 5 is VERY good. 6 and 7... IDK. My personal opinion, the series *kinda* falls apart towards the end? But only because 2/3/4 are so fucking good. And the ending is fantastic. Well, there are parts of it that really suck... but, really, the ending is fucking fantastic. 

Your point, though, that the story can go in so many directions... it is a dangerous one. The second you start reading book two, you lock the story on the rails. You are reading what happened, and so you lose the feeling of ""so many ways it could go."" Because you learn ""this is where it goes.""

That being said, the Dark Tower King's magnum opus. The whole thing is large and a bit unwieldy. It is the precursor to the Marvel Metaverse. It literally starts pulling from EVERYWHERE King can think to pull from. It gets crazy. It pulls from all of his other novels. It is every storyline at the same time. That is kinda one of the themes. 

So, on one hand, in one way, you LOSE the feeling of the story being able to go in any direction. BUT, you gain the fact that the Dark Tower is the Metaverse and embraces the concept of a metaverse with all directions and stories converging... so it still kinda let's you keep that awe and wonder. 

tl:dr - King is great and I love the Dark Tower.",EGOtyst,2022-07-29T18:58:12Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,28

The first book is an amazing stand alone and King immediately destroys all the meaning and impact from the Gunslinger in the very next book. 

The rest of the books are just masturbatory garbage and some of his worst writing. 

I know everyone on here(this sub should just be called r/kingisking) regards King as the greatest author of all time, but he just isn't.

it has King's 'voice' in it, you know the way he develops characters and some stuff like that gives it a taste of King ... but it is really different to his other work - it's difficult to pin down. It builds slower but more complex, like a tornado of spiderwebs - it feels deeper and has more gravitas than his shorter works. some of the Castle Rock books, the small stories that intertwine give me the same feeling but not anywhere near as intense. i am a fast reader, but King always checks my pace anyway ... but Gunslinger made me read and reread and think and ponder.

Spirit things that don't even have bodies are horrible whores that try to seduce and destroy him. Daughter of the guy at that gas station or whatever... whore.

fun2bl_25,fun2bl,"Many years after he wrote the original, he went back and revised The Gunslinger. That's the version I read. It was a tough read, in some parts, but the rest of the series more than made up for it. 

Wizard and Glass is my favorite, but the Wolves of Calla is a very close second. And The Wind Through the Keyhole, which was a later written companion piece, was really good.

I was pretty distraught after WAG, and it was a few years before I could start up again. Luckily, TWTTK had come out by then, which was perfect. TWOC was so intense and brought back some childhood trauma I had from Salem's Lot (my experience with that is a story in itself). 

I know some people didn't like the later insertions of real life people and things, which was weird at first. But I remembered reading an article, long ago, where King described the ""fan"" mail he got from people. He'd get letters from people on death row, or terminally ill, telling him that he had to finish the series before they died. Oh, and no pressure, but it better be the greatest story every written. I can't imagine the stress on a person to do that. So I tried to understand the feeling of being made to feel like you are solely responsible for other peoples' closure, the way they want it. It's an impossible task, and people can be very unforgiving.

fun2bl_35,fun2bl,"My sister is a huge SK fan and when I told her I had picked up Gunslinger she made me wait to read it until I had read The Talisman (which I loved) and Black House (which I found harder to enjoy). They arent DIRECTLY part of the Gunslinger story but I do understand why she wanted me to read them in conjunction with the Dark Tower series.

The Dark Tower pulls together so many of Kings stories. There is a list at the front of some of the Dark Tower books that shows which stories you can find the overlaps. I am currently going through and rereading all of these simply for the added depth I may not have caught the first time through.


One of the things I love about the Dark Tower series is that SK wanted to write his masterpiece, his own Lord of the Rings type epic(something he said himself). He was young and sure and set out to write the book before he had it all worked out. Halfway through, he got lost and put it away for, what, two decades? His fans write and ask for an ending. A man on death row begged him for an ending. I cannot imagine coming back to finish a story after twenty years...especially with the first half already published and devoured by constant readers. Yet, he cant escape it. 20 years and he still sprinkles little easter eggs in the pages of other stories echoing this other reality. 


Finally, he does it. He comes back to face Roland and his Ka-tet to deliver them their fates. I think this is why some of us find fault with the flow of books 4 and 5. I think King had to come to terms with how he felt for his characters and where he knew they must end up.",brigrrrl,2020-04-04T15:14:21Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,35

Oh, also, I really don't believe people should first read the new version of the Gunslinger that King put out a few years back, when the original is much simpler.

I felt the disjointed narrative worked in the book's favor. Roland's world is going entropic, the land and its people are more and more separated from each other, and the old way of things is almost totally lost to time. Roland's trek through that broken world made his sense of purpose feel more powerful.

There is not a sense of urgency that seems like the writer is saying ""I need to have some action or development happen here in order to hold the reader's interest"". I love when stories allow the world to speak for itself and give the reader/viewer time for quiet contemplation.

fun2bl_53,fun2bl,"There are dozens of us!

Aside from the fact that I just don't find his plots all *that* interesting a lot of the time, my major issues with him mainly come down to the following:

1. He's got a distinctive voice as a writer... but not much range. No matter what type of story of his you're reading, you always know it's Stephen King talking. This sort of folksy, cheesy ""Well listen here, bucko!"" quality permeates everything he writes.

2. This ties in with #1: His characters are repetitive, repetitive, repetitive and relatively shallow.  He's got like, 4 or 5 different main character archetypes he can write, and he just re-skins them for his various books. (and they all sound like different aspects of Steven King, rather than unique individuals)

3. He doesn't do ""show, don't tell"" very well. Far too many times, he'll simply write out a paragraph-long (or worse) description of what the characters are seeing, rather than weave it into the narrative. (Like, if a character walks into a run down building, he'll describe the dust in the air and broken glass on the floor, and peeling paint and grime on the walls, and the layout, and *then* describe the character trying not to step on the broken glass, and being disgusted by the grime, and trying not to choke on the dust. Why?)

4. As a result of #3, his books - which for the most part aren't very long - really tend to drag.

5. I assume he must get around some, given his money and fame, but many of his books set in real-world locations feel like he'd never actually seen anything outside of rural Maine. For example, his description of NYC in the early Dark Tower books... oh my God, the horror. (Also, given that he wrote so many books centered on a guy called the Gunslinger, his ignorance about firearms is sometimes quite shocking. No, I don't mean Roland's magical shooting abilities - he just writes stuff sometimes that makes me wonder if he ever so much as shot a BB gun as a kid, or handled a handgun. And I don't mean to harp on guns in particular, it's just an especially glaring example of him clearly not doing even the most basic research.)",Y-27632,2020-04-04T15:35:48Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,53

It's been a while since I read the book but I remember a few key events: Roland killing that entire town because of the number 19 and child Roland sacrificing the eagle to win the fight that do foreshadow the ending. When you think of it like that, Roland has always been the kind of person who would sacrifice others to achieve his goals. He has always been driven and ruthless. It would be one thing if the events of the book led people to think Roland wouldn't, but they don't.

Other than the broader trope of a happy ending and generic expectations readers have because of other books, there is nothing in the Gunslinger alone that suggests that both of them will survive.

To me, it's very much like the Red Wedding. Something that you don't expect only because books usually don't do it, but once you get over the surprise you realize that it does make sense for the characters.",,2020-04-04T12:19:40Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,58

I think it gives the false assumption to readers that the book and the movie are the same which of course everyone who reads books and watches the movies based on the books know that they are very rarely the same. And i feel bad for some readers who watch the movie and then read the book with the movie cover assuming that its going to be just like the movie. The Gunslinger is a prime example. Even worse is that people who made the movie said that the movie wasn't an adaptation but a continuation of the story. Or in other cases the movie is a big departure from the book. I Saw the movie The Revenant and thought it was a good movie and when i got a chance to read the book It wasnt like the movie at all. It wasnt a bad book, i still enjoyed it but key points in the book where nothing like the movie. So i agree with not having movie covers of books on the books. I think its a cheap way to sell books to people trying to get into reading and buying something expecting that they are getting what they are buying which a page to frame adaptation of the book. and its kind of tacky looking. If i want a book and they only have a movie cover version of it, to me its worth the wait to get what you want.

He wrote The Gunslinger when he was 19, so he was a young, unrefined Stephen King with heavy ambition of writing a sprawling epic.

f4s7tw_10,f4s7tw,"I might be in the minority, but I was very satisfied with the way that King wrapped up the series.

There's just enough explained within the series that it starts to make many of his other books make sense (The Stand, The Most, It, etc.).

However, much of the king universe is never over explained, which I think would ruin it.

Long story short, I think the dark tower series is well worth reading cover to cover, but I also think the gunslinger stands as a really interesting stand-alone piece.",,2020-02-16T22:30:23Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,10
f4s7tw_11,f4s7tw,"I wonder if you read the original version of the book or Kings' reworking of it? One of the main complaints about the original version was how opaque it is and how it doesn't fit in with all the other books tonally. So he reworked it and I never liked the reworked version. I felt he sacrificed the poetry of the original version for clarity, 

So while there is a version of The Gunslinger that has additional clarity and is probably a better introduction to the series for complete newbies I prefer the poetry of the original even though it doesn't match up entirely with the rest of the series. 

But to answer your question, things get a lot clearer in the ensuing books. Read ""Little Sisters Of Eularia"" if you haven't already. And if you've read a lot of King books prepare to revisit from familiar places and well-known faces. All paths follow the beam, and all King books are linked through The Dark Tower.

I'm not gonna give spoilers, but it is a long,  wild ride. As for the ending...all I can say is HAIL DISCORDIA! 

The thing is that for me Roland might be the most compelling and relatable character I've ever encountered. I don't wanna sound like a dork and a fanboy,  but because I could identify so much with Roland, his dislocation,  alienation, chivalry and extraordinary weapons skill, the whole stranger in a strange land thing.   Having grown up in Appalachia and then going to college, it's like being transported from rural 1960s culture to urban modern culture.  I've also been shooting handguns since I was 5 and competitively since my mid teens...im not trying to say im Roland good...im saying compared to someone who just picked one up it will seem to them I am. So, maybe it's just me...but the bugle and cry ""Gunslingers! To me!"" Really stirs my blood. There's more...but I guess want I want to say is it's possible the DT series works better for me because of who I am, my experiences,  but I suspect, if you're willing to put it the time, it will appeal to most people.

Wastelands is Book Three and it is the members of the quest the fated ones getting to know each other and surviving perils together.

f4s7tw_20,f4s7tw,"If you continue to expect every fantasy epic to be as neat and ordered  as Sanderson’s books, your expectations will not be met.

And I don’t mean expectations in the sense of quality, but rather style. Sanderson has a very scholarly way of ordering his magic/books. And that’s why his books sometimes feel canned, like they’re coming off an assembly line. So be careful what you wish for. 

The Gunslinger is extremely small in scale compared to the later books. It perfectly sets the stage for this mysterious, dying world and Roland’s desperate, perhaps doomed quest. The Waste Lands and the Wizard and Glass are two of the best SFF novels I’ve ever read. The Waste Lands in particular is quite heavy on worldbuilding. But again, if you’re expecting everything to be laid out for you like some silly alien science, you’re going to be disappointed. 

Please also remember that King is NOT your run of the mill fantasy author (like Sanderson, Rothfuss, even GRRM). He’s not even a huge fan of high fantasy. So he’s drawing on completely different sources and influences to create the Dark Tower. 

Lastly, if I sound curt here, I apologize. Sanderson and the other usual suspect fantasy authors are constantly discussed here. They give people a very warped idea of “good fantasy.” 

The Dark Tower series is truly unique, above all else. It has elements of many, many different genres. I find it fascinating and hugely underrated among the typical SFF crowd.

Do these other 6 books offer as you say ""solid answers"" I would say yes and no! But that is the joy of reading the series, because the tower means so many things to so many people. What the tower means to you once you finish the books will be different then what it meant to me. But I will say it is amazing how King interwove this world and those of his other books, and even autobiographical events. Some of the greatest Joy's I found in the later books were those connections to other king worlds.

The books which come after do *not* add mystery, they actually start to explain more and more why the tower is the nexus of size, what is going wrong, what will happen if action is not taken and why Roland is in many ways bound by blood to the search for the tower. In many ways, he hears Des-car-Gan as strongly as anybody else in the multiverse save possibly one. I still think The Gunslinger is a super awesome book in it's own right. Fairly short, an easy read, some great characters and an amazing ending and the hints about what lies ahead.....man, they dont even give you a clue what kind of rocketship you're about to take off on. Drawing Of The Three is where it absolutely throttles up like crazy. The Waste Lands is also balls to the wall crazy. I find Wizard and Glass to be the turning point in the series, an incredibly sad book that explains so much. From then on the arc is even richer than previously was. *sigh*

King gives you enough information that you know what happened, but he doesn’t bother to go so in-depth as to give you every single little detail.

f4s7tw_35,f4s7tw,"Hey all. Huge SK fan and first time poster here.

I like to think of the DT series as a huge tree in the forest of King's career. He started publishing in the 70s, and The Gunslinger first came out in '78. He continued writing the DT books for OVER 30 YEARS. Can you imagine? This story that started as a seed, then took root, and over time grew and grew to this massive tree. 

With that being said, his writing over the years has changed. He is not the same author now as he was when he started. So therefore the books have evolved as he has. For all you Constant Readers, compare his early writing with his books published in the 90s, and to his latest releases. They're not the same, right? A tiny shoot doesn't look the same as a hundred-year-old tree.

As many others have posted, I encourage new DT readers to push through The Gunslinger. King was young then -- and while it's personally not my favorite of the series, it definitely lays a lot of groundwork for the future. A root system to support that big tree, if you will. You will be rewarded with the fruit of his labor later on, as the tree grows, I promise.

I imagine many of his other works to be parts of the DT tree. Some are full on branches, some leaves, some little buds. Some are completely separate trees in the forest that are connected to the DT by the leaves touching, or their roots overlapping. Some are just growing in the shade of the DT tree. And many aren't related at all! But over such a long career, the DT was constantly on King's mind, and it comes through in a lot of his other works. You can find lists of connected stories, if you're interested.

I don't know if you're a King fan, or if this is your first time reading anything he's written. But I encourage you to keep at it. You will feel a whole range of emotions, and that says a lot about the talent and skill of the author, whether you love the books or not.

Wizard and Glass is my least favorite, I suspect because it's the most truly fantasy, and I don't care for teenage romance much. That being said, it's my least favorite of my favorites.

f4s7tw_85,f4s7tw,">sober King forgot how the story was supposed to proceed

He actually did, and mentions as much in the foreword of the last three books. He started The Gunslinger when he was 19 years old (hence all the references to 19 in that book) and snorting coke daily. He didn't have a fully thought out plan for the series, only that he wanted to write a LotR-esque spaghetti western. He slowed down writing the series as he progressed because he kept losing the thread of the overarching plot, and eventually paused all together for more than 10 years because he really didn't know where to take the story next, combined with personal problems related to his drug addiction and getting hit by a van. He only finished the series because of popular demand (again, he says so in the foreword of the later books, that if it were up to him he'd have left them unfinished because he knew he couldn't do the story justice anymore). When he finished writing The Dark Tower he was around 60 years old. I give him credit for pushing through and trying to finish the series, but it didn't have an interesting plot or interesting supporting characters and we didn't get to explore enough of Mid-World and End-World. People call The Dark Tower series his magnum opus but I heavily disagree. Just because it has the most words and the most references to his other novels doesn't make it the best.

Roland is on a quest to find the Man in Black, and the first book showed that he was intent enough to sacrifice Jake to get what he wanted.  However, the Man in Black showed Roland that his real quest was to get to the Dark Tower, and that he would need those three companions he meets in The Drawing of the Three if he hoped to have a chance to make it.

You finished the Drawing of the Three, which was basically a ""let's get the gang introduced and together"" book.  The rest of the books go on to show our group becoming closer and stronger as they find and fight their way to the Dark Tower.

Salem's Lot

3y0sm2_3,3y0sm2,"Yeah, you should always keep in mind, that The Gunslinger was first written by King as a weekly-short-story published in a magazine. So each chapter was more or less a short-story on its own back then.

This might be the reason why it's sometimes as tough to read as a shoe-sole :D

I really urge you to read through and at least finish Book 2, The Drawing of the Three. Because that's where the plot really get's going. However, you need the first book as some kind of ""backround-knowledge"" about Roland, the Gunslinger.

While the first book shows the journey of the Gunslinger, the second book introduces 2-3 new main-characters that will stay through the whole series. Also while the 1st book does not really tell anything about the World around Roland, the 2nd book really takes off your blinkers (like horses) and explains all the world. I imagine you will go like "" **What the Fuck just happened?**    or **How....?** or **Why....?**

King is really great at making you ""speechless"" and think about how something could have happened this way, etc. etc. :)


But, if you really can't get into the book, just lay it down, maybe try it later, but be not disappointed :)

It really creates a sense of pure Sci-fi/fantasy wonder for me personally as I am a big fan of the Lone gunman archetype and the aesthetic of the novel as a whole.  That being said after first having read it, it left a sour taste in my mouth as well, I was sort of.. unsatisfied with the way the story assumed the reader's knowledge of this world, but my appreciation for it has grown after having read the next two installments and growing more acquainted with Roland and his world.  I highly recommend you read The Drawing of Three, it is more like Kin's familiar style and is objectively more entertaining imo.

Book 2 is really good,  books 3 and 4 are WONDERFUL!  Book 5 is really good and takes an interesting turn, book 6 is ok, book 7 is a let down.  

My problem with the ending is that it doesn’t really pay off any of the lore or all the interesting details peppered throughout the series.  Like the number 19 or the old world tech... books 2-6 lay out a lot of interesting, mysterious details, but they don’t really matter at the end of it all.  

I still recommend the series and I plan to do my first re read this summer.  (It’s been close to an decade).  Book 4 is the stand out masterpiece of the series, though it’s a tough one to start.  A lot of people seem to stall out at book 4.  Book 3 is a breakneck rollercoaster of excitement so when you get into book 4 it stops everything and flashes back to stuff you don’t want to get distracted with for 500+ pages.

King says he wanted to go back and ""fix"" the book when he came back to it years later, but didn't because he felt it wouldn't be right. Or something along those lines, it has been a while since I read it. 

But anyway, I sort of gave the writing a bit of a pass because at least King was self aware about it and the story was interesting. There were a few eye roll moments, but I have read worse. Then the next couple books in the series are much better, and really build on The Gunslinger and the world(s) it started. As I read on I found that the first book isn't the best, but it is something you have to get through if you want to continue the story.

If you have read other stuff by King and enjoyed it, you should consider continuing the series. If you don't really enjoy his style or aren't familiar with his other works, it might be best to just put this one down and move on. I enjoyed the series, but I wouldn't really consider it a must read. ",jof1029,2018-06-12T22:04:39Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,4

I couldn't find a copy for at least three more years,  when it showed up in a used bookstore I used to frequent. Then, a couple years later,  Drawing of the Three was published, I devoured it. then

Wait,

Wait,

Finally Wastelands was published, and I devoured it, then

Wait,

Wait,

Wait a goddamn long time (ten years?)  then finally

Wizard and Glass was written.  It's my favorite of the series followed closely by Wastelands, and then Drawing of the Three.

Wait a bunch more years, and the last three are all published quickly, and reflect that, unfortunately.

Then ten years later,  Wind through the keyhole,  which is a damn fine book.

The 'idea' behind the gunslinger was as important as the story itself,  and making us wait for friggen\-ever was genius in its way.

The first book is absolutely brilliant, if you're a fan of the pulp fiction stories it's emulating(and expanding on)

g017xp_1,g017xp,"Well. You certainly picked a doozy to get back into reading. The Gunslinger is a confusing read. It will get a bit more focused about halfway through, but it will not really become an easier read. That said, it is definitely worth it if you plan to read the rest of the series. Just out of curiosity, is it the original or the revised version?

I would not worry too much about looking things up during your read. King wrote these books in such a way that the setting is presented like a shipwreck: broken things scattered here and there, some of it familiar, a little of it useful, but the overall impression is a broken and forgotten world. It is not the reader's world, so he or she is not expected to understand everything. 

Focus more on Roland and how he maneuvers the obstacles placed in his path. His world is interesting, but his path is what will hook a new Tower Junkie.

50tkxu_3,50tkxu,"That first book, the Gunslinger, was actually written by King as a series of short stories he was trying to get published in fantasy journals back in the day (60s I think). So they are more stand alone vignettes than seamless congruent chapters. But then he just ended up turning them all into Book 1.

And then he said he sat it aside for 20-25 years bc he realized the ideas and stories that swirled around it were way beyond his abilities to properly tell in words (at the time). So think of it as the Prequel to the rest of the books. And it makes much more sense, especially the end on the beach with his palaver with Walter where the grand visions of the Dark Tower and it's place in things is described, as this will be the central theme to the destination of his journey in the rest of the books.

5ots8g_2,5ots8g,"I would say it's a mixed bag, but your mileage may vary.

I read The Gunslinger in '87, and I absolutely fucking loved it, to this day it's one of my favourite books.  I thought it was really sensual and dreamy.  The second one came out shortly after, and I liked it a lot, couldn't wait for the third and fourth books (which he described in the afterword of the second book).  I waited for years, and finally the third one came out in '92.  I liked the Waste Lands a lot, I thought it was better than the second one.  And I have to admit that even though the fourth one was saccharinely sentimental, I really enjoyed it.

But after Wizard and Glass, I thought it went to absolute garbage.  Typical Stephen King, he's a great story teller, but he's horrible at tying it all together.  I thought the side stories were pretty good though... Little Sisters of Eluria and that new one, the Wind in the Keyhole.  But the main series itself just fell apart into incoherence, at least for me.  In fact, I probably would have stopped reading in the middle of the sixth book, but by then I had been waiting 16 years for the end of the series, so there was no way I wouldn't see it through.

Full disclosure: I love Stephen King's work and I have read over twenty of his books and dozens of his short stories (which is where I think he really shines)",daddydoesalotofdrugs,2017-01-19T03:05:12Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,2

I was on board up till this point, then the following books roll back the the severity of this sacrifice by giving him back his son he killed in exchange for the answers he needed to save all of existence. Ignoring prior characterization in order to give him weaknesses that were unnecessary, when being too willing to kill others to save himself were a valid weakness already.(I'm talking about him assuming the lobstrosities were a dream and therefore letting them maim him when in the previous book it had been established that his ""deadly hands"" killed of their own volition whenever he he even suspected he might be in danger, including his own mother!)",Monkeknuckles,2017-07-11T04:30:00Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,2

8elno6_5,8elno6,"I found it to be a hopeful ending. When Roland starts the loop anew at the end of the series, he starts it with the Horn of Eld, which he hadn't before. The voice of the tower is pretty explicit on that. In the journey told in the series, the Horn had been lost at the Battle of Jericho Hill. King actually went back and added that information into the earlier books when they were revised and he was working on later novels in the series. 

> Yet the voice whispered it again

> (different this time mayhap different)

> ...

> He shifted his gunna from one shoulder to the other, then touched the horn that rode on his belt behind the gun on his right hip. The ancient brass horn had once been blown by Arthur Eld himself, or so the story did say. Roland had given it to Cuthbert Allgood at Jericho Hill, and when Cuthbert fell, Roland had paused just long enough to pick it up again, knocking the deathdust of that place from its throat.

> This is your sigul, whispered the fading voice that bore with it the dusk-sweet scent of roses, the scent of home on a summer evening-O lost!-a stone, a rose, an unfound door; a stone, a rose, a door.

> This is your promise that things may be different, Roland-that there may yet be rest. Even salvation.

> A pause, and then:

> If you stand. If you are true.

I loved the ending because it set up further adaptations of the series while providing the would be adapters with license to change Roland's journey.  

When the movie was in the works, a lot of the marketing and leaks mentioned Roland having the horn, meaning the movie could be a sequel to the series in addition to an adaptation. 

They fucked it up, of course. But a future adaptation my not. 

My head canon is that presence of the Horn would have changed his and Jake's fates in The Gunslinger. He might have blown it as a way to scare off the slow mutants, for instance. Or perhaps when he is faced with the choice of letting Jake die, in the split second before he decides, his hand grazes the horn at his belt, and in doing so, it reminds him of those he has already lost, or what it means to be a gunslinger, yadada. He then chooses to save jake from falling.

From there on, the story could go in any number of directions different from the way it goes in the books.

The Wasteland is the most brilliant, creative, and entertaining fantasy novel I've ever read.
Wizard and Glass is so boring and trite, and the ""romance"" at the core so lacking in any actual romance that the entire novel is almost unreadable.
Wolves of the Calla is just the Magnificent 7. In pre interviews, he stated this. Then you read it, and it's just the Magnificent 7.

Oh, and at one point Roland basically turns toward the camera and says, ""know all those awful books like Hearts in Atlantis and Insomnia you read because King said they tied in to the dark Tower series? Well, they don't.""

8elno6_12,8elno6,"I found it to be a hopeful ending. When Roland starts the loop anew at the end of the series, he starts it with the Horn of Eld, which he hadn't before. The voice of the tower is pretty explicit on that.

> Yet the voice whispered it again

> (different this time mayhap different)

> ...

> He shifted his gunna from one shoulder to the other, then touched the horn that rode on his belt behind the gun on his right hip. The ancient brass horn had once been blown by Arthur Eld himself, or so the story did say. Roland had given it to Cuthbert Allgood at Jericho Hill, and when Cuthbert fell, Roland had paused just long enough to pick it up again, knocking the deathdust of that place from its throat.

> This is your sigul, whispered the fading voice that bore with it the dusk-sweet scent of roses, the scent of home on a summer evening-O lost!-a stone, a rose, an unfound door; a stone, a rose, a door.

> This is your promise that things may be different, Roland-that there may yet be rest. Even salvation.

> A pause, and then:

> If you stand. If you are true.

I loved the ending because it set up further adaptations of the series while providing the would be adaptars with license to change Roland's journey.  

When the movie was in the works, a lot of the marketing and leaks mentioned Roland having the horn, meaning the movie could be a sequel to the series in addition to an adaptation. 

They fucked it up, of course. But a future adaptation my not. 

My head canon is that presence of the Horn would have changed his and Jake's fates in The Gunslinger. He might have blown it as a way to scare off the slow mutants, for instance. Or perhaps when he is faced with the choice of letting Jake die, in the split second before he decides, his hand grazes the horn at his belt, and in doing so, it reminds him of those he has already lost, or what it means to be a gunslinger, yadada. He then chooses to save jake from falling.

From there on, the story could go in any number of directions different from the way it goes in the books.

I feel like it could be something else, but I don't know what else to call it). *Wolves of the Calla* is more like a spaghetti western, kind of in the vein of *The Magnificent Seven*. *The Song of Susannah* is back to urban fantasy. *The Dark Tower* (the last book, not the series) is...I don't know, some other kind of fantasy, but not traditional Tolkien-style fantasy.

4dvj5j_1,4dvj5j,"The gunslinger is just the opening book of his Magnum Opus, the Dark Tower. It is one of my favorite books now, but it is not a great standalone novel. It gets much better in the context of the series. I am not necessarily suggesting you read the Dark Tower (although it is awesome and encompasses most of his other works), just keep in mind that the Gunslinger is one of his earlier novels and kind of setup for the rest of the series.

I have read most of his works, people in general seem to like The Stand the best, but it was only so-so for me. A lot of his stories have endings I can't appreciate, they leave a bad taste in my mouth. Cell and Under the Dome specifically are awful examples of good books that had nowhere to go and no ending in sight. Under the Dome was good except the length; and I thought Cell was excellent except I hated the last 20% of the book.

Cujo is very good, Salem's Lot is one of my favorites. The talisman (with peter straub) and its sequel Black House had me captivated. I also loved Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers (two of three of a trilogy slated to end this summer).

The sequel to the Shining was good (Doctor Sleep) - and I never read the Shining although I've seen the film ten times probably.

His work can be largely hit or miss, but I always keep coming back because of his natural dialogue, the ease of his storytelling, and his knack for finding words to describe feelings I've had that I wouldn't have been able to explain - to make his characters somehow relatable in their little foibles, both good and bad parts of their personalities.

9aedsw_2,9aedsw,"The first book was written first as a short story when King was in college. He expanded on it years later, but around the time of Carrie (1974). 

So you're basically reading his college work in the first book. I can understand where it may feel a little confusing- this world is obviously not ours but there seem to be strange connections in songs and references.

Another thing that probably threw you off is the pacing. Pacing in the story is all over the place, with it dragging in some areas and moving quickly in others, but not in a comfortable way. There's a reason for this that is explored in the later stories- as was mentioned in the book, the world has moved on. Their world used to be a place of beauty and light but something happened and it's now...worn out and dying. One of the affects of this has to do with time. I honestly can't remember if it's discussed in the first book so I won't go into detail. What I will say is that time (and pacing) in the books is really interesting because of it.

And the gunslinger is a very two dimensional character here. He's supposed to be. He's an icon of what this world *was*, the last gunslinger who still has a code that he lives by. But you can see that the world changing has had its toll on him because he's not like a knight, all chaste and pure. No, Roland has some pretty bad tendencies. And he's on a mission and nothing will stop him from that.

""Go then. There are other worlds than these.""

I mean, he sacrifices a *child* to capture the Man in Black. Was it worth it? Did he learn anything? Was he able to 'stop' the great evil?

No. It wasn't worth it.

And that's what he learns in book 2. He *is* just a killing machine in the first book. That's what the first book is telling you- it even outlines his childhood and emphasizes that he's not very smart. It was his friends who were always smarter, more empathetic. These are all intentional choices that you'll see expanded in later books.

There are reasons for all of these things. But it's up to you to decide if you want to continue. I hope you do! I find the entire series fascinating, not just for the story, but the construction of it.

It introduces the secondary characters and feels much more like a fleshed out novel than The Gunslinger. Roland really starts to come into being as a character as the series continues, and he really gets fleshed out in Wizards And Glass and it makes a lot more sense why he is how he is.

There is just no consistency. He seems good at turning a couple of pages, but then the next several pages feel tedious and forced. How many chapters in ""The Drawing of the Three does he spend on his house of cards metaphor? It shouldn't take a good writer that long to explain a metaphor. I see these kind of hangups in his more recent novels just as often. He also should just stay away from sex scenes, which even in his newer novels are written like someone who is really bad sex. (Poor Mrs. King) I think, all in all,  I'm just over it. He has a certain appeal to a young hungry reader that does captivate one at first.

It's not just the books, these days.

>will very much depend on individual opinions of individual story elements

Yes, also true. I guess in terms of Jake specifically I would have expected a bit more fanfare perhaps, some more introspection, some internal push-pull about it. Admittedly by this point in the story I was speed reading so I could have missed it. Without it, it feels empty. And there's not even really enough character development of the gunslinger (IMO) to make sense of it, like - were he a vector for destruction, a child who smashes sandcastles just because they exist, you'd get it. Were he an established Good Guy, you'd be shocked! (Your note on Gunslingers, in general, well taken as context that maybe he *is* a Good Guy and \*I\* just don't get it). As a sacrifice it doesn't hit especially meaningfully because it's not a *sacrifice*. It doesn't phase him. We don't really even know how he feels because it's one of the parts of the spectrum of feelings the character isn't imbued with.",matinmuffel,2022-07-31T18:40:36Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,18

> As a sacrifice it doesn't hit especially meaningfully because it's not a sacrifice.

I think you're right. The character, at that point, I don't think it did phase him. There was some hint toward the idea that he had taken Jake to his heart as a surrogate son, but I agree that it doesn't really land because Roland isn't really a person yet. He's more like an archetype. But, as an archetype, The Gunslinger carries some baggage. Even if they're rough around the edges, they're Good Guys. Good guys don't murder kids, and main characters were good guys.... ergo...

But, from a distance, I think you're correct that there's zero indication, in the text, that Roland would even consider not dropping him. So the sacrifice (in the sense that Roland had to kill him to catch the Man in Black) is meta-textual more than anything.",ctruemane,2022-07-31T18:47:53Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,19
1oh1sy_1,1oh1sy,The Gunslinger is a sort of odd book in that the true magic of the Dark Tower series doesn't really shine trough untill the second book when the universe gets expanded quite a lot and more characters are introduced. The first book feels more like a standalone novel in most parts to me where you follow one character that isn't really that interesting at first. There are some subtle (and not so subtle) hints to where it will go from there but it isn't untill the second book  that the scope of that series really becomes clear. I will say that to get the most enjoyment out of the Dark Tower series it's really recommended to read some of King's other novels too because DT is a series with a lot of connections to King's other works.

The Stand was long, I hate that he felt a need to revise it however. 

Tommyknockers, Gerald's Game, Rose Madder, Insomnia, Black House.... The list goes on and on. The Green Mile was good, but that is a collection of novellas. 

I finished The Dark Towers and had hopes. I wish I could have the dollars and hours back. Was told Wind Thru was ""ok, worth the read for Dark Tower fans.""  I must not be a fan. Then I was given 11/22/63 from my father and told, ""best since Pet Cemetery, thoughtful and original.""  I disagree and found it pandering and obvious. 

A Stephen King short story collection I would buy tomorrow if it came out. A new novel.... I'll pass. 

Lastly, don't get me wrong; if you enjoy it, then read it. Just don't try to convince me that King's a genius or misunderstood or deeper than I think. Being nominated for an award doesn't make you a good writer. Not unless it's the Pulitzer, and even than..... 
But then, I know the knocks against Russo, Harbach, Weir, Morgenstern, Glen David Gold, and Chabon, but I enjoy them; with the understanding that not everybody will.

All sorts of zeugma (to “yolk” words, phrases, and clauses together in some manner). Polysyndeton.

Well, and The Shining (which you said already), and Salem's Lot.

He really has a lot of great shit. Especially when he was younger. There was a sweet spot in his career where his voice was fully matured, but he still had to listen to an editor.

5h1hik_5,5h1hik,"As a ""constant reader"" of King who is otherwise completely unqualified to assess the quality of literary works, I believe there are basically 3 eras of King literature. 

The Early Years (early and mid seventies) where King was a hungry young author trying to catch a break. This era is best represented by *The Shining*. His stories in this period were new, shocking, and visceral, but perhaps a bit unpolished. 

The Cocaine Years (late seventies to late eighties) where King was a serious alcoholic and drug addict at the height of his powers. Everything he wrote in this era is absolute dynamite IMHO, but if I had to pick one to be the defining work of this period, it would be *The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger* 

The Serious Years (early nineties to present) where King becomes conscious of his role in literature and begins to produce more sophisticated, cerebral, and subtle works. And while no less dark and horrifying, something is missing when I compare it to his work in the 80's. I can't put my finger on it, but I know it is there. None of his work in this period is bad, but nothing in this era has left me breathless like *The Stand* or *It*.

*The Stand* was what I would consider his first book from the cocaine years. He still had all the passion of the hungry young artist, but had really hit his stride. It was a story told many times, but he told it best. I read it 20 years ago, and I can still name virtually every character and recount the plot.

1rp0q3_1,1rp0q3,"The first book is vastly different than the ones that follow, in terms of story, characters and even writing style. *The Gunslinger* was one of King's first written books, so there's a world of difference between it and even the second installment. His writing style changes between this book and the later ones (I won't say it improves, but it does change).

Personally, I felt similarly underwhelmed by *The Gunslinger*. Not much happens in it. Essentially, the book is just setting up the rest of the series. Its almost an ""introduction"" or ""prelude"" as opposed to an integral part of the story. The book is almost solely to set up a certain death and the idea of the Dark Tower as a nexus point of all existence (with that trippy scene at the end. Both of those are important concepts for the rest of the series. The other books explain things much more...in fact, they probably explain things a little too much, ruining some of the mystique with strange complicated subplots and storylines. 

As for whether the other books are any good...

*The Drawing of the Three* - In my opinion, this is the best of the series. Worth reading, although its still essentially setting up the main story. 

*The Waste Lands* - I thought this one was OK, but its generally considered one of the better books in the series. The story really picks up here. 

*Wizard and Glass* - The story comes to a complete stop here and tells a story from Roland's youth. It does explain a bit more about his quest and his motivations, but its one of the most boring, tedious books I've ever read. A lot of people like it for some reason though. 

*Wolves of the Calla* - Personally, I liked this book quite a bit, but its an almost independent story apart from Roland's quest. 

*Song of Susannah* - Complete crap, but its at least fairly short. Nothing important happens. 

*The Dark Tower* - A lot of people hate this book, but I actually thought it was one of the best in the series. It tied the whole thing together in a really great fashion. The ending was great and it made me glad I stuck through the series' more lousy parts.

kmwjl_3,kmwjl,"I had always had the opinion that Stephen King was a horror writer, and not a very good one, at that. [Hang with me, lemme finish.] I had read those short stories (in one book), the Langoliers, and Secret Window, Secret Garden, etc. I thought they weren't bad, but they weren't good, either.

Years later, a friend of mine was raving about The Dark Tower series. I protested because of my fairly-unfounded opinion, but finally gave in. That series blew my mind. It was everything I could want out of a series (except maybe being a little more concise), and I recognized how immensely talented he is. I've started reading other books of his with a more open mind. Insomnia is amazing. How did I ever doubt this guy?

Then I realized, I've seen several of his books-turned-movies, which are always horrible. Maybe that's why I disliked him. And then... as I started reading the Gunslinger comics... I read an intro by him, in which he stated he always allows people to have full creative control when they adapt his novels. He says they might end up terrible (and often do), but who is he to stand in the way of someone else's vision?

My favorite works by King are found in the short story collection *Skeleton Crew*.  The author is at his best when he reigns in his self-indulgence and commits to write a story, not an epic.

I read all the books as they were released -- *except The Gunslinger which I read at the same time that The Drawing of the Three was released*. I only say that to underscore the frustration I felt during those times when waiting for the next book to be published and that thrill upon reading, which continued for over 15 years (for me) and the disappointment when I finally reached the Tower myself.

I truly loved the series until those last chapters of Book 7.

I also read many of the other ""ancillary"" books leading up to it... Hearts in Atlantis, Insomnia, The Talisman, Black House, and The Stand.

I really wanted to like that ending. But the ""death"" of the Crimson King was anticlimactic (and implausible in the mythology of the book), and the entrance into the Dark Tower itself and what happened there was a cop-out, in my opinion.

Fast forward 10 years. I hadn't recreationally read in years. I looked at my small book collection and saw Dune. I thought to myself why not? I re-read it and went on to devour all six books. Say what you will about 5/6, Miles Teg is a bad ass. 

At this point I felt why not re-read what you already own? I devoured myself through The Dark Tower series, having no troubles as I initially had with the backstory of the 4th. I absolutely love the saga. 

Afterwords, I was hooked. There are so many accessory novels that loosely tie into the Tower. I started with re-reading The Shining. Afterwords: The Stand, It, Eyes of the Dragon, The Tommyknockers (meh), Insomnia, Hearts in Atlantis, currently working on The Talisman. 

I find The Dark Tower series to be King's magnum opus. He attempted to create an entire universe. His works have a way of tying all together, which is brilliant.

2vkitu_30,2vkitu,"That wasn't the point of his warning, not by a long shot. King didn't fear the polarizing nature of the ending and he didn't actually want to warn people off of it. 

Roland's journey through the series is one of obsession. How many times has he been given the option to turn away from the tower and find some shred of happiness and contentment?

Roland was able to justify his obsession for a while, after all the entirety of creation was at stake. But once the beams are saved and a happy ending is ensured he is warned time and again that seeking the tower serves no purpose and will only lead to misery.

Does he turn aside? No. He has invested too much of his life to this quest to let it go. Despite every assurance that creation is safe, that he will bring himself only pain, he pushes forward. He cannot imagine getting *so close* only to walk away without knowing what lies inside.

When King warns us to stop reading, he's giving us *the exact same choice* that Roland is given, because our journey is *exactly the same* as his. We've been through the *same* hardships and invested *too much* into these books to let go and *not know* how it ends, to *not know* what lies at the top of the tower. King very subtly admonishes us for condemning Roland's obsession by pointing us out as hypocrites. Can you imagine a scenario where you would actually *listen* to him and stop reading? 

Furthermore the story is shown to be influenced by many sources. The storyteller is given direct influence over the story in-universe, but the reader is given some influence as well. As though they, too, exist in the keystone world because, in a very real way, they do. The story is something that happens outside of the books, but still relies on them. If you put the book down the story can conclude however you imagine it (or however ka wills) but by pushing on and reading that last chapter, you actively *condemn* Roland to his fate. The cycle will only stop if you listen to the warning.

But you can't. Roland can't.

I found it to be a haunting book, one that sticks with you and sets up the entire series, from Roland's morally grey character to the Man In Black's speech about how size defeats us.

Drawing of the Three was a good one, but not the best. Characters were ace. A Demon called Heroin, Odetta, sick Roland drinking soda for the first time. I liked the flashbacks with Eddie and his brother, and when Roland encounters policemen. Lobstrosities were cool. Overall, a good read. 


Series began it's peak with The Wastelands, with some amazing characters. Eddie and Susannah's Gunslinger training, Gasher and Tick-Tock Man in the city of Lud. Blaine the Monorail, and how much of a pain he is. Jake and his journey from home to Mid-World. Really good story. Eddie and Blaine's interaction was cool. 

Wizard and Glass is without a doubt the pinnacle of the series. For three books we all wondered how Roland came to be who he is. We all wondered who Cuthbert and Alain were, and the parts they played. The bar scene alone in Mejis is outstanding. Smartass Cuthbert with Jonas and the Big Coffin Hunters. Rhea and the Ball. The small glimpse you get of Roland's dad. Great, great story.

I won't go into books 5-7, because at this point the series flies completely off the rails. Roland doing a rice dance, Dr. Doom bad guys with lightsabers, Giant Spider Arthurian Legend that kills off one of SKs most important and recurring characters. Writing himself into the books as the lynchpin of creation. 

He spent so much time building and crafting this entire universe in intimate detail that at some point, he figured it was just time to wrap it all up. And he did, as fast as he could. Not because his own creative process demanded it, but because we did. And he totally shat upon his greatest tale that was interlocked and shared through almost every book he ever wrote. It was really a bummer to see that happen.",Captain_Enizzle,2015-05-07T14:34:28Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,2

Yes, DT is a unique mash-up of genres from fantasy to old west to pulp fiction, but at its heart it's about the Gunslinger's obsession with the Tower. Along the way he meets fascinating characters (including Stephen King himself!) but ultimately we discover he will sacrifice ANYTHING to fulfill his quest for the Tower. Roland is the most tragic of heroes because of this (and if you read the very last chapter of the last book - which King actually warns you not to - you'll understand why). Does that help?",,2013-07-17T18:23:54Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,1
1ii20p_2,1ii20p,"It starts out with a concept that's easy to identify with and get into - good vs evil. The gunslinger and the man in black. The first book hints at a deep history and a broader world that is strangely familiar but different. It really pulls at your curiosity. That curiosity is what drove me to read beyond the first book, and with each book the world and the story just keeps building on itself, expanding in all directions.

Personally, I think it has one of the best backstories of any series I've ever read. It has a backstory that is an epic unto itself, to which King devoted almost the entire 4th book in the series too, and which sparked its own comic series. It makes you feel for the gunslinger, Roland, feel what he's lived through and where his motivations come from. It makes him human. It prevents the Dark Tower from being about some trope troubled-good-guy character, and makes it about a man you have a real emotional investment in.

What really hooks you though is that as the story moves forward, and the world keeps building upon itself, it starts to give you that feeling that it's all connected. Not just the Dark Tower series, but every book Stephen King has ever written. It's like that feeling you get when you reach the end of a really good mystery novel, or the first time you saw a ""twist"" movie like Usual Suspects, and you see all the pieces you never connected before put together right before your eyes. Except it's a reveal that takes place over multiple books, so you can't put them down until it's all explained to you.

1ii20p_3,1ii20p,"I am going to probably repeat what some others have said but this is why I love the Dark Tower.

The Gunslinger. Roland is by far one of my favorite characters. He is a combination of a knight Errant and a wild west gunfighter (I am probably stealing this description). Think of King Arthur meets The Man With No Name. His quest is compelling, I wanted to find the tower with him. He is a complex, doing terrible things but he is good, if not compulsive. 

It is action packed. Gun fights, Killer Robots, monsters, demonic offspring, evil witches, evil relatives, evil good guys, other evil things, murderous kings, spiders, time travel, alternate universes, wizards, giant bears, nuclear bombs, dystopian societies.

Greats supporting cast. The main members of Roland's group (his ka-tet), all go through intense struggles, and their characters are not one sided.

1ii20p_4,1ii20p,"The Dark Tower was one of my very favorite book series.  The first four books were released roughly every five years and they are great.  The Gunslinger is good, The Drawing of the Three is better, The Wastelands is better yet and I can't express how much I love WIzard and Glass.  Stephen King was nearly killed by a van between Wizard and Glass and Wolves of the Calla and, in my opinion, that incident ruined the series.  The final three books were released over the course of ONE year.  I've always suspected that Stephen King faced his mortality and rushed to finish the series to ensure that it was finished before he died.  I have very specific complaints, but I'm not going to mention any spoilers.  I'm always shocked to see unconditional love for this series as a whole when you consider the last three books, in particular the last two.  I did really enjoy the ending, but the story leading up to it left a lot to be desired.

1ii20p_5,1ii20p,"I'll give my thoughts. The series as a whole is basically high fantasy much the same as Tolkien and the like, only instead of being loosely based around medieval Europe it's loosely based around the frontier west (at least until book5)

I think book1 is the best of the series, the opening line is fantastic. It's very tight at ~150 pages. The tone is as grandiose as he aims for it to be. Last of all and most important there's a passage (the palaver) at the end where there's an explanation of what the Dark Tower is and it's just amazing.

Books2,3&4 are all very good. 4 is probably the best of them but it's almost entirely flashback to when the gunslinger is a child and I didn't like ""I'm just going to drop my story for the next 700 pages and tell you a completely different story that's only partially related."" since it brought the narrative to screeching jarring halt.

Books5,6 & most of 7 get real stupid real fast. It feels like he was in a hurry to finish them and just wrote whatever came to mind and most of the end of the series reads like a fever dream instead of the incredible tone of Wild West Fantasy we had to begin with. Introducing characters from other books King's written, robot bikers out to steal psychic children for reasons that still make little to no sense, a character with multiple personality disorder where only 1 of 2 or 3 personalities is pregnant with a were-spider (yes you read that correctly, by this point my guess is the editor had just given up) who has 2 fathers and a mother who is one of the personalities of the MPD character but has a body entirely separate from the MPD character so its never lear if it's a case of possession, self-projection or imitation.

When King introduces himself as a character in his own work of fiction and retconned his own near death experience into a crucial element of the plot I almost gave up put the damn thing down. But I'm glad I didn't, the very very very end (after the defeat of the crimson king) is well thought out and the final chapter, though incredibly frustrating, is worth it.",allofmyinternetz,2013-07-18T02:03:49Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,5

King writes pulp. Pulp can be ok and fun but his isn’t. McCarthy on the other hand is probably one of the greatest living authors. Comparing them is like comparing Leonardo da Vinci to your best friends aunt who has gotten exited about watercolours. Ok, maybe that’s harsh on King but the difference in craftsmanship and vision is massive.

2ysgu1_3,2ysgu1,"Keep in mind when King wrote The Gunslinger, he did so back in the late 70s, long before the second book (and way way long before the final three).  It was written as sort of an homage to ""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came"" by Robert Browning and was not really meant to be part of a series.

Only when it became so popular did the second book come out, nearly a decade later, in 1987, and he kind of went off the rails to flesh out the universe.  I have no idea which version you are reading (I have both), but in 2003 he added a bunch of stuff to Gunslinger to flesh out the world and make it more cohesive to the later books.
I loved the original and thought the universe was brilliant until the end when after spending 3 decades creating this magnum opus, he just churned out the final three books back to back to back.

Do not read Little Sisters of Eluria before DT 1, even if its a prequel. 


Here's how I would fix it. (I'm ignoring the comics, never read them)

1. The Gunslinger

2. The Stand

3. The Eyes of the Dragon (if you're going to read this at all, there's no point saving it until the end)

4. Drawing of the Three

5. The Wastelands

6. Wizards and Glass

7. Little Sisters of Eluria

8. Salem's Lot

9. It 

10. Insomnia (you can toss out Ur, you can even toss out It. You can't toss out Insomnia)

11. The Talisman

12. Black House (personally, I didn't like Talisman and Black House, and the connections aren't too major, but many people on reddit recommend them. Black House has way more DT connections, but is also poor, IMO)

13. Wolves of the Calla

14. Hearts in Atlantis (Read before DT 7)

15. Song of Susannah

16. The Dark Tower

EDIT: I don't know much about the comic series (not the adaptations), but from what I can tell, they're a bit spoilery with respect to much of the back story. I'd save those until after you finish the series. 

EDIT 2: You also say you're reading The Gunslinger 1st edition. I must remind you that King made a number of changes to The Gunslinger in 2004. This is the version to read. His original has continuity issues that don't mesh with the rest of the series, and gives away a few secrets.

45ct4u_1,45ct4u,"For me it seemed as if King lost his way after Wizard and Glass. His accident seemed to have some sort of negative effect on his writing style. From Wolves of the Calla onwards the books seemed disjointed and awkward, with the introduction of the number 19, and eventually writing himself into the story.

I enjoyed the last portion of Dark Tower a little more, with Roland and Susannah trying to survive in the wilderness, making clothes and foraging. I could have read more of this. My biggest gripe was the final demise of the Crimson King, the master villain behind many of SK's books, slain by some secondary character introduced at the last hurdle. And without the rest of the Ka-Tet there to help or witness the end. I'm sorry, but a small part of me wanted that cliched ending, with the gunslingers all standing side by side, the final showdown. And the Man in Black aka 'Randall Flagg', the biggest villain of them all, again dying at the hand of a secondary character.

Normally I'm fine with novels that make you figure stuff out, but the Gunslinger went way too overboard. Why was Roland chasing the man in black? Who the hell is Martin, or whomever the dude was that was talking to Roland's mom? Why do the slow mutants exist?

6cwj5v_2,6cwj5v,"If this is your first foray into Stephen King's work, I'd recommend stopping for the moment and maybe switching gears. He wrote the Gunslinger when he was rather young, mostly because he liked the character, liked the ideas ... it's almost more like playing with the ideas than trying to go somewhere. As he got older, he wanted to make it MEAN something.

So what the series becomes, eventually, over the next thirty years, as Stephen King becomes Stephen King, is the story of his literary life. The Dark Tower books contain characters drawn from his other stories, together on a quest to find the Dark Tower together. It could be said to be something of a meta-piece about writing itself. I mean, Stephen King IS A CHARACTER in the series.

So, it's perfectly okay to just enjoy that first book the way he seemingly intended, as just a cool story. And if you're really enjoying it, there's other books you should perhaps read first---or at least books that you could read to increase your deeper understanding, if not your enjoyment---like The Eyes of the Dragon, The Stand, The Talisman, Salem's Lot, and a few others.

7vz0oe_1,7vz0oe,"As someone else has already mentioned and this is something I agree with: King is a fantastic writer, but he doesn't write endings very well.

Personally though I loved the story and it's one of my favourite book series. Those characters really grow on you as the series goes on. His character development is top notch, and it's one of my favourite things about King. He writes them so well, it makes you feel as if you are a part of their ka-tet, instead of just reading it.

Even though it kinda contradicts what I said earlier the ending of The Dark Tower really grew on me. The more I thought about it, the more I liked it. I believe it is very fitting. As I was reading I waited for the big reveal or battle at the end of the book. Instead my first reaction was: ""What? That's it?"" But I think it makes sense. Ka is a wheel as he says..

The thing I disagree with though is the ranking. I'd say:

 1. Wolves of the Calla

 2. The Dark Tower

 3. The Gunslinger 

 4. Drawing of the Three

 5. Wind through the Keyhole 

 6. Wizard and Glass 

 7. The Waste Lands (I actually stopped reading there for a couple of months... it was so dense) 

 8. Susannah

To me Susannah is the worst book of the series. Period. I hated it. I loved how short The Gunslinger and Drawing of the Three were. King tends to write too much for his own good sometimes. I really think sometimes less is more.

As evidenced in his short stories, which I think are fantastic, but that is a different story.

7vz0oe_2,7vz0oe,"Personally, I thought Song of Susannah was weak. It was almost like a novella connecting Wolves and The Dark Tower. I liked *most* of The Dark Tower, although I agree the Flagg payoff fell flat. I absolutely loved the ending though - what happens when Roland reaches the top of the Tower. I didn’t care much for the Crimson King. 

I remember reading The Gunslinger over and over as a teenager. During Roland’s acid-trip conversation with Walter over the campfire, Walter alluded to both Marten (as Flagg) as well as something called the Beast, as sort of final bosses before the Tower. I loved those concepts, and I wish King had explored them. I think King kind of changed his mind about a lot of ideas he’d introduced earlier, when he realized he needed to somehow wrap this whole thing up. I can’t blame him, but man, I wish there could’ve been some Beast, Lovecraft-style, between Roland and the Tower. 

Re The Wastelands. You make good points about how long it takes to get going, and how it kind of ties a few things up too neatly (eddie’s carving, etc). Those are good points, but I still love TWL. Partly it’s because it was one of the three books published when I was a kid/teenager (I was 17 when Wizard came out, but I’d read the OG books about 17,000 times from age 10 on). I just loved some of the batshit crazy stuff in TWL. Blaine, the crashed fighter plane, the ZZ Top drumtrack, the giant bear, etc. I felt like TWL was where we really started to get the sci fi aspect. TWL also has possibly my favourite scene of the entire series: when Roland tracks Jake and Gasher down to the Grays’ headquarters. There’s a lot of buildup and tension leading up to that can confrontation, but when it comes down to it, Roland just smokes all the bad guys in a handful of seconds. He even shoots two of them in the back when they run, because he can’t risk being slowed down by them later if they “rediscover their guts”. That was my favourite portrayal of Roland - total killing machine, even with one hand. We got the same sense of that when he goes up against Balazar’s guys in The Drawing of the Three. 

I would agree that Drawing is the best of the series (although the original Gunslinger, before King’s revisions, will always have a special place in my heart). But I’ve rambled on enough. And typed all this shit on my phone. ",rpmcmurf,2018-02-07T21:17:04Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,2

My friend has read *The Gunslinger* and couldn't take not reading the next book, so I won't recommend that strongly. 

China Mieville's Baslag series have stand-alone books. I started with *Perdido Street Station*.

*Dune* is also another good stand-alone book.

21kpsf_2,21kpsf,"> Reading The Gunslinger and skipping the rest of the Dark Tower series?

You can comfortably read the second book without even having read the first one, all of the characters except the gunslinger are newly introduced. The gunslinger doesn't really get developed as a character in the first book, he's more of an archetype. The fourth book is about 95% flashbacks to the Gunslinger's youth and can also be read on its own, as all the flashback characters are being newly introduced in that story as well.

So my suggestion is to read those three books in whichever order feels right to you. These are also, in my opinion, the best books in the series. Each one offers something very different. The Gunslinger is very Clint Eastwood. The Drawing of the Three is sort of a ""race against the clock"" thriller with great villains and gunplay. Wizard and Glass is a very dark coming-of-age story with even better villains and some really disturbing horror elements.

You can read these three books without feeling like you're reading a series of related books, so I think it would work for you.

The first Foundation definitely works on its own as well, and although I liked the first sequel, I think I rather would have stopped with the first one and let some of the mystery remain.",builder_,2014-03-28T18:51:42Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,2

As others have noted, *The Gunslinger* was written by King as a series of short stories, which he had begun writing in his early 20s.  He likely wasn't sure where he wanted to go with it.

In fact, the original release was even more different; he had to go back and clean it up to make it mesh with the other books a little better.  Some of the changes (cited from Wikipedia):

* Roland originally read a magazine in Tull, but obviously magazines are no longer a thing of his world.
* Gilead only fell 12 years prior, Cort is possibly still alive, and Roland is not implied to be ancient/nearly immortal but rather fairly young.
* [I forget which book this spoils](#s ""Walter is not the same person as Marten""), and Walter pretty unambiguously dies.

Ref the DT - specifically the first book - OP, you may want to see if you can find a pre edit copy of The Gunslinger. King retconned a bunch of stuff in that book and there was good reason for a very small amount of it but he either got carried away once he started or felt like he couldn't change that little in terms of text and re-release it.

I prefer the original - it feels barer, emptier, travelworn, hollow in a way and that suits the story and it's place in the series better in my eyes than the more polished, 'cleverer' later version.

You're probably already aware of the edit given the detail of your review and research but just in case. It bugged the hell out of me when it first happened as Audible just auto updated my copy without any notification and it felt off the next time I listened through.

oeneh_1,oeneh,"There's more!

Roland Deschain has made this journey countless times. Why is *this* particular time special? What does he learn on this journey that he didn't learn on all the others?

To let things go. To not sacrifice All for the tower. 

In The Gunslinger, he sacrifices Jake rather than let the man in black go, even though he could have caught up to the man in black later. He's in a hurry; everything must be done *now.* He sacrifices David, his hawk, to spur him onto becoming a real gunslinger. He sacrifices people like chess pieces to speed his journey. 

But at the end of it all, when Susannah asks, he *lets her go.* He explicitly does *not* force her to finish the journey with him; he refuses to sacrifice her. He's learned his lesson too many times, with Jake and Eddie and Oy most explicitly. 

The entire scene where Stephen King is admonishing the readers who want to see what lies at the top of the tower? *He's talking to Roland.* He's the one who's been mistaking the destination for the journey, the squirt with the act of lovemaking.

When the books ""loop over"", it mentions that he has the warhorn in a throwaway line that feels much more important *because* it's just in a throwaway line.

Also, the poem King based the series on, ""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came"" ends with that Roland blowing his horn at the base of the Dark Tower.

Drawing of the Three is where King opened it up, it's no longer just the narrow and focused offbeat narrative, it continues from the conclusion of the first book, introduces characters and settings you can actually relate to, and breaks some of the conventions of what is expected in the Dark Tower world itself.

You can even skip reading The Gunslinger and start with Drawing of the Three. It does a good enough job explaining what happened along the way.

It starts to add a lot more to the already existing plot line as well as branching off into subplots that flow and tie in nicely, and the series as a whole mixes together in the end to become something greater than one book of the series could convey.

The Gunslinger was my least favorite of the series. I mean, I thought it was ok, but the rest of the series is just so amazing. He wrote an introduction to The Gunslinger (his intros are always worth reading) and the gist of it is that he wrote the first book when he was 19, with all the ambition and arrogance that comes with that age. So you kind of have to bear that in mind and trust that the series improves with his age.

lrb9fl_1,lrb9fl,">!Consider the following: You, the reader, are not Roland but Roland's obsession. His obsession with the Dark Tower is your need to read to the end. Who is really dead or alive or not isn't important, what's important is *the end* that you absolutely must go to despite being told repeatedly that it's unnecessary. The quest over, the Tower saved, but you *must* go to the end, you *must* see the top of the Tower. The obsession that friended his weapons, the ones who lived and died with ***my life for you*** on their lips just as faithfully as any of Walter's thralls, to cast them to the side of the path, that was you pushing to another pointless ending.!<

4end6z_1,4end6z,"I read this question while I was scrolling on mobile and thought ""fuck yea, let's talk Dark Tower"" and had to get my laptop for faster typing.

First, yes, *Salem's Lot* is definitely worth a read. My first time reading it, I hadn't yet been introduced to the DT series. I was in 8th grade, and my teacher asked me if my parents knew what I was reading. I said ""yes"" and proceeded to worry her for the better part of a year going through the series. 

Second, the loop is presumably on repeat *until* we get to the end of the series. When he starts over, he's picked up Cuthbert's horn (which he left behind in the previous iteration). What I imagine the takeaway is: Roland was on repeat in search of the Tower, which holds up the universe. But the Tower is *only* doing that, holding things up. It's just a physical support that has been metaphorically exaggerated into something surreal and unknowable and meaningful. Roland's loop is a warning against chasing the mythological, especially when it is at the cost of the tangible relationships he had (and relationships he creates, although they are created while in search of the Tower). Like others have said, the ending describes Roland beginning a new iteration, but the iteration is already slightly different, and therefore suggests a new adventure (even if the differences are only minor). And that begs whether or not the previous iterations have all been the same, or all slightly different. 

Again, like u/6814MilesFromHome said, the Tower is like a pivot point, and each time Roland hits it and starts a new iteration, it launches him into a version of his life from the moment he chooses to pick up the Horn. Which is kind of fascinating/confusing to me because *The Gunslinger* starts with Roland chasing the Man in Black, not picking up/deciding to leave the Horn. So where have other iterations started? All different? All the same, but we are just getting a slightly different story with *The Gunslinger* - King at least did put emphasis on leaving the Horn behind through the series as a meaningful moment, so perhaps I'm overthinking it.

Old Ones... more mythology probably? Trying to give credit to ""beings"" for seemingly godly work. But even in that sense, gods don't necessarily have to be immortal - we don't really know how long this universe has existed. And who's to say the Old Ones *wanted* to be immortal? Or that they aren't still around and just don't wanna put up with people's shit anymore? Or that Old Ones passed on the role, which warped and changed over time as it was passed down, and maybe that's where we get some of the beings/creatures etc. in the series.

Endings suck, in general. I think King just had to put *something*. ""There is more than a world to win"" is so accidentally meta, Roland believes it when he says it, but it also is an omen for his own amibition. Reaching the Tower costs him everything, but the journey and gathering his Tet could be considered a ""world won"" of itself. 

I'm in the final planning stages with my tattoo artist for the sleeve I'm dedicating to this series. I re-read the series several times solely trying to narrow down the quotes I wanted to use. It was nearly impossible. I settled on a mashup of my own creation: 

""There is more than a world to win, and we will be magnificent. That is the truth, if you can but dig it.""

Happy to engage in any more DT talk - even mindless meandering blathering!

",,2012-10-17T16:00:43Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,1
gvzbq5_1,gvzbq5,"Nice overview/review. From a Constant Reader (one of those who followed the journey to the Dark Tower, book by book, year by year, from 1982), it's nice to see how the series appears to those able to read it all in a go.

A fundamental issue with the series is that King (as mentioned in the foreword to *The Gunslinger* (though possibly not in all editions, certainly in the earlier printings before it was revised)) simply sat down and wrote the first line to see where it would take him. Those first five short stories were simply the first steps of a journey. King used to write outlines (more usually than not, at the time of starting *The Gunslinger* stories) but later stopped the practice, so that first book is perhaps King deliberately testing out the waters for a writing journey with no specific ending - or indeed middle.

The next three novels appeared as and when, but as novels, and still with no obvious ending in sight.

At the same time, King had also explored his own Dark Tower universe, famously with the Turtle in *IT*, as well as other related books like *Insomnia, Black House, Hearts in Atlantis* and the *Desperation/The Regulators* pairing, and there is an old interview from the mid/late '80s where, when asked about sequels to his earlier books, he mentions that Father Callahan wanders, lost, and eventually finds a home in a town called Thunderclap in the land of Lud. So there is obviously a lot percolating in the background.

Then King got hit by a truck and was nearly killed, and  - taking heed of an older fan who once told him she didn't expect to live to finish reading The Dark Tower books at his current rate of writing them - and with a new view of his own mortality - he sat down and wrote and published the final three novels within a year or two; but I think they were written in a rush, probably not planned out and redrafted to their potential, and represent, at best, a compromised version of the story King set out to write.

Writing himself into the story isn't a thing I believe the pre-accident King would have done; it's a kind of stared-death-in-the-face hubris of realising that when a writer dies, all his future works - entire worlds - die with them. Coupled with the concept of multiple universe - including one in which Father Callahan is a character in a book called *'Salem's Lot* - I can see where King was struck with the idea, but it seems the rush of wanting to finish the series took away the second thought that might have made him rethink it.

Also, the plethora of villains - Marten, Mordred, Flagg, the Man in Black, the Crimson King - is confusing and dilutes the essential antagonist aspect that every quest needs. At the beginning, Roland seems to be pursuing the Man in Black, who is running, presumably to safety with his 'boss' who resides in the Dark Tower. That's simple, and it's all we need. Ranging hither and yon, picking up new villains, aspects of villains, just diminishes it all in my view.

Conversely, I love the ending. Partly because - in my view - having Roland start out again with the Horn of Eld ensures that his journey will be successful, and also because, after the huge anticlimax of the final battle, having written himself into knots, and almost assured of losing a swathe of readers with whatever ending he decided on, King just sidesteps the entire question and leaves it up to the reader. Of all the hair-pulling, eye-rolling narrative decisions he makes in those last three books, this one - the daddy, the cherry on top - is so ridiculously ballsy, that I can't help but like it.",HugoNebula,2020-06-04T11:14:46Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,1
gvzbq5_2,gvzbq5,"Well put!  I sensed the trouble brewing with Wolves of Calla with his newly invented dialect, “lucky numbers” that I didn’t recall from the earlier books, and then him writing himself into the story was the final blow that killed all my enthusiasm for King.  The guy loves his Deux ex Machina and he truly indulged himself in it here.

Making Walter, Martin, and Randall Flagg the same character was so stupid as was revising the Gunslinger (one of the best things he had written”.

It was a great relief after this disappointment that the Harry Petter series ended in a satisfactory way.  King would have been better off giving up on the series and left us with the question of what might have been rather than knowledge that the whole thing was a rediculous waste of time.",ALMessenger,2023-10-14T18:47:23Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,2

mocpxw_3,mocpxw,"First time reader. Doing an “Extended Read” of the Dark Tower that includes other books from King’s mythos. I’m loving it so far. I’ve finished books 1-2 of Dark Tower. My next book is The Stand. I’m loving it and super pumped to see where the journey takes me.

EDIT: Credit to u/riancb for the list and notes below the line. There are A LOT of interconnections between King books, on the full spectrum from Easter Eggs to Plot Points/Characters. This list DOES NOT list all of those, but just books that might be the most fun on a read on a journey to the Dark Tower.

As an aside, my early order so far was:
Gunslinger (DT Book 1)
The Talisman
Eyes of the Dragon
Drawing (DT Book 2)

I really liked reading Gunslinger first as an introduction to the DT world instead of The Talisman. It's like a prelude to the series. But future DT books change a bit in style and scope, so if you don't like Gunslinger, I would recommend reading Gunslinger and Drawing back-to-back. Some people always recommend reading them together from the start, but I think EotD slots well between them. The Talisman can be read anywhere before The Stand, I think. I skipped the Shining until after The Stand as a shorter book as a break.

IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE: DO NOT LOOK UP ANY CHARACTERS NAMES OR PLACE NAMES ONLINE EVER. Google, Wikipedia, and even King Fan-Sites do a REALLY BAD job of hiding spoilers. Spoilers are often front and center, not hidden under warnings. There are many mysteries throughout the journey, including people with aliases, places which go by different names, things which happen in different orders, etc. Part of the fun in the journey is figuring out these mysteries for yourself. I have been ""spoiled"" on a lot. I put it in quotes because I won't know if they are spoilers until I read the conclusion of those mysteries. But I wanted to warn readers against looking anything up. 

----------------------------------------

From u/riancb:

NOTE: By no means are ANY of these side trips necessary, but I think it adds to the experience:


The Talisman (Being adapted to a Netflix show by Stranger Things creators.)

The Gunslinger (Revised) (Dark Tower Book 1)

The Shining (Optional. It’s on here because it introduces ""The Shine”, an important idea in general for many of King's books. Also, a pretty quick and fast read.)

Eyes of the Dragon

The Drawing of the Three (DT Book 2)

The Stand (Uncut)

The Waste Lands (DT Book 3)

IT (Jax-El added comment --> From other lists, this is a big book with litte connection, but adds to the mythos as a whole. So I am unsure when I will read this.)

Wizard and Glass (DT Book 4)

Insomnia

The Wind Through the Keyhole (DT Book 4.5)

‘Salem’s Lot

Everything’s Eventual (2 Stories: Titular Story and Little Sisters of Eurlia.)

On Writing (Optional, but adds some interesting and relevant context to the last few DT novels. To say any more would be a spoiler).

Wolves of the Calla (DT Book 5)

Hearts in Atlantis (The whole book, imho, although you could just read Low Men Yellow Coats.)

Doctor Sleep (<-- Book added by Jax-El because I am reading The Shining. I don't know where to place this.)

Song of Susannah (DT Book 6)

Black House (Sequel to The Talisman)

The Dark Tower (DT Book 7)


The Gunslinger (Original version, and totally optional. It might be fun though to compare after finishing the series what the original start was like).

Then rinse and repeat a few more times until your out of tears and/or time.

Lastly, to emphasize, absolutely NONE of these side reads are necessary for the series; they merely add context to additional novels and gain some cool Easter eggs and character crossover.

If you need to shorten that list, the only two I’d say are ABSOLUTELY essential are INSOMNIA and SALEM’S LOT. Although the novellas in EVERYTHING EVENTUAL (titular one and Little Sisters Eluria) and the first novella in Hearts in Atlantis (Low Men Yellow Coats) are also highly recommended. Other books like IT, INSOMNIA, and THE STAND are improved by being read with the Dark Tower books though, because they are influenced by the mythos from the books.

If you’re curious, if you embark on this extended reading experience, it’s approximately 3.90 million words. For comparison, that’s like reading the Harry Potter series 4 times, or like reading Lord of the Rings (with The Hobbit) 8 times. The Wheel of Time is one of the few longer Fantasy series, at 4.4 million words.

----------------------------------------

I read ‘The Gunslinger’ and loved it. And proceeded to read the others, which by the time I had finished reading, ‘The Dark Tower’ was released. 

I love this series for the fact that it was pure fantasy, and wasn’t formulaic or cliched as such. I loved its weirdness, and it tapped into this long-held desire to believe that there are other worlds below and behind the mundane reality we exist in day-to-day.

As epic sagas go, it’s not as well conceived or executed as others. Some of it is poorly written, King’s prose is at times annoying. His small-town folkisms and the voices that utter them are always a little contrived IMO. Other parts are a joy — I particularly liked the tragic tale of Mordred the spiderboy, as he hunts for Roland towards the end of the tale. Other parts I thought were ludicrously bad - Blaine the train, the Crimson King, even the ending of the saga - which was a massive cop-out if you ask me, because he didn’t know how to end it. 

Frustrating at times, but otherwise I enjoyed it.

mocpxw_15,mocpxw,"I read 'The Gunslinger' when I was 12 years old in 1990. I read 'The Drawing of the Three' when I was 13 and then immediately 'The Wastelands'. What follows is my humble opinion: I loved Gunslinger and Wastelands. Like *really loved* them...and I think that was because there was mystery and intrigue about the world that had 'moved on' and the strange technologies left behind that they would stumble across. I think maybe 'Drawing' was a little too mature for me at the time, as I've re-read it as an adult and it was much more interesting than I remembered it being. All that being said, it was like when 'Wizard and Glass' came out, King had decided that he would kind of abandon all the intrigue and mystery of the world he had created. Of course, his writing had changed drastically in the timeframe between Wasteland and Wizard and Glass. He lost an edge that I don't think he ever recovered and I found the rest of the series to be boring, unfortunately. I also hated the ending. I could go on forever, but your comment coerced a response out of me!",03ifa014,2021-04-11T00:24:37Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,15
mocpxw_16,mocpxw,King even admits in the intro and ending to Wizards in Glass that the cocky 20 year old King who started the Gunslinger series is different than the 50 year old who was returning to write Wizards and Glass. It’s really no surprise that the writing from then on takes a shift as King admits that he took on Wizards and Glass with the acknowledgment that he needed to finish the work his 20 year old self assigned him.,Yttrical,2021-04-10T22:57:18Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,16
mocpxw_17,mocpxw,"Not a bash, cause it’s a matter of taste, but I found the gunslinger refreshing. Kings books often start off super slow with build up of every single character in the book no matter how unimportant they are to it. You hardly know there’s a plot in the wordy slice of life expose until half way through near a thousand pages. The gunslinger starts off with plot and builds character along the way, which is totally different.

His forward, *On being seventeen*, made it clear that it was the kind of book full of imagination and unlimited possibilities, the way a teenager would write. It’s not as content rich because a commitment can close off the possibilities of what the gunslinger and the man in black represent. I think the imagery spoke volumes.

mocpxw_27,mocpxw,"I know it's always lame when people say ""the series gets better"" but the Gunslinger, IMO, is the worst book in the series. It doesn't really match the feel and tone of the rest of the books and only really works as a launch pad for the story going forward.

It tells you the type of man Roland is through its series of adventures. The rest of the books build on that foundation and change him, as well as introduce characters that are much more likeable than who Roland is in the first story.

Also Book 2  (and really every book going forward) feels a lot more cohesive as an individual story. Each book is less ""a series of adventures"" and more ""One long chapter of a large sprawling adventure"".

It's also worth noting that the Gunslinger was originally written to be a stand alone story and it shows in how different it feels from everything that comes after it.

I would consider trying The Drawing of the Three. It's my personal favorite of the series. And if you don't enjoy that, definitely drop the series because it's just not your cup of tea.",Fresh_C,2021-04-10T22:56:22Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,27

deh0c2_1,deh0c2,"I assume that you've read at least The Gunslinger.

Stephen Kings ""The Dark Tower"" is a multibook saga that has 7(.5) main books following Roland of Gilead, the last gunslinger and the last ka-tet (Friends, Fate bound, family) through an epic that touches on nearly every other work King has written, likely several as yet unwritten, and even his own life. The tale itself is based loosely on the poem ""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came"" by Robert Browning (another excellent read)

For fans of Kings work it should be an easy and intriguing read, so I'll assume you've not read more than a few of his bigger works.

The Gunslinger is a tale told backwards, in a way and it can be disjointing for some readers. It also doesn't do an excellent job of giving backstory. In fact, all ""The Gunslinger"" really gives us is setting and exposition, with a little action and a lot of chatting. I was hooked from the first line, which is in my less than humble opinion the best opening line ever written. The pacing and backwards nature intrigued me and left me wanting more, so I gladly picked up the second book.

The Drawing of Three is where the series sets it's pace and really hits a stride. The entire book was interesting, action packed, and overall pushed the series into a direction that really intrigued me. The next 3 books blazed by until the series hits it's only major hitch in Wolves of the Calla, but by that point you should be used to the world enough that it doesn't hit too hard.

TLDR: The Gunslinger is a great introduction to Roland and his archenemy, but it's just that, an introduction. The Drawing of Three and The Wasteland are at LEAST necessary to an honest run at the series. If you read those two and do not like them, you can move on and say you gave it an honest run.",JustcallmeSoul,2019-10-07T09:43:42Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,1
deh0c2_2,deh0c2,"I'm very conflicted about *The Gunslinger*. I guess the best way I could describe it is to say that it's an uneven book.

There are certain things I love about it. I find the characters and the setting intriguing. King is more about character than worldbuilding, so don't expect to get a series filled with lore like a lot of other fantasy series. But for me that's not a knock against it, because I care more about character than I do about worldbuilding. The little information you get about them just leaves me wanting more. 

The shootout in Tull is still my favorite moment of the series. I love a good western, which is probably why the Dark Tower appeals to me more than other fantasies.

If the book feels disjointed, keep in mind that it was originally published as four short stories and then later compiled into a single novel. Other books in the series feel more complete. 

As for the writing, I'm a big fan of King's prose style. That's not to say I think his writing is all that great; it's probably just that I'm used to it, having read over 50 of his books. His writing is like a comfortable old sweater to me. That said, *The Gunslinger* doesn't evoke that feeling for me at all, the way that most of his other books do. I assume that's because this first book was written very early in his career, before he'd found his voice as a writer. His very early works (Night Shift and Carrie come to mind) are the same way. So if the writing doesn't 'sing' for you, don't assume that that's going to be the same for all the books in the series.

I would recommend you at least read the second book, which is very different from the first, as it spends a great deal of its time in our world and introduces you to the main characters for the rest of the series. Really, the second book feels more like a traditional first entry to a series, where The Gunslinger is really just an appetizer. 

Ideally, I'd suggest trying to push your way through to the fourth book, which is my personal favorite, and the one that's the most like a conventional fantasy, but if you're not feeling the second one either, that's up to you.",,2019-10-07T14:15:39Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,2
deh0c2_3,deh0c2,"I think you're comparing it to the wrong books: all of the examples you quote are long - and largely complete - novels, with fully formed and dense fantasy worlds. *The Gunslinger* is made up of a series of short stories, written and published over a few years (what is called as a collected book a 'fix-up' novel), in which King was experimenting with a new voice, and planning to explore the world he'd created as he went along (in much the same way as famously writes novels, plotting as he writes).

The rest of the series was written as novels, and the voice of *The Gunslinger* becomes lost in King's more usual easy-reading prose style, and they definitely begin to flesh out and explore the fantasy world, so you may find them more to your taste.",HugoNebula,2019-10-07T10:25:22Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,3

I'll echo what other have said here and recommend trying the second book, The Drawing of the Three. It's a pretty quick and easy read and is way more interesting because.. Ya know... Stuff happens.

Also, someone pointed out to me once that he also started writing this when he was very young and I think some of that comes through in the writing. 

That said, I would not call King a very good writer. He does some things very well and he's a pretty good storyteller but the writing is, IMO, average at best. He does have a way of keeping you reading though and that's an enviable skill right there. 

I would recommend to switch to English, your level of English seems perfectly good. English is my third language so I've read my fair share of translations into my native languages and the original English and there are some books that no matter how good the translator is (I'll never knock translators, I am one! It's a necessary job because we don't all speak all languages!) some books are just too much in a style that reflects a whole culture and the translation cannot hope to match that :)

Did not disappoint! It was maybe the best use of the ""being yanked into a different world"" trope (long, but you know what I mean) I've seen in fiction.

I read books 3-6 after and circled back to book 1 only to find it an almost-unnecessary prologue.

Edit: I haven't finished any other King books. I'm sure many references went over my head. Still enjoyed DT.",vignettethrowaway,2018-03-18T10:46:12Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,3
85acyo_4,85acyo,"I'm an avid Stephen King reader and I disliked only two of his books: The Gunslinger and Mr. Mercedes. The Drawing of The Three very much redeems The Gunslinger, but I really think you should have started somewhere else. The Shining, for example. Don't give up on the King!",DMX8,2018-03-18T18:51:04Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,4
85acyo_5,85acyo,I haven't read any of them in ages but that's one of my favorites because he rambles much less than usual. He's not great at self-editing. All of his books are usually so bloated but The Gunslinger felt sparse and mysterious and fit the setting very well. The only one I liked more was probably Misery.,BigPorch,2018-03-18T11:15:10Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Gunslinger,5
