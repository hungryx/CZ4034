I discovered Allan Eckert's body of work and found it much more engaging. It's historical fiction; not highfalutin literature.

Allan Eckert’s ""The Winning of America"" Series

Chronologically:

1. “The Frontiersmen” – largely about the life and exploits of Simon Kenton and his contemporaries, e.g., Daniel Boone (like Daniel Boone, Simon Kenton could be the real life model for Cooper's Hawkeye)
2. “Wilderness Empire” – about the French and Indian War: 1754 to 1763 (this is where *The Last of the Mohicans* would fall in).
3. “The Conquerors” – about Pontiac’s Rebellion: 1763
4. “The Wilderness War” – through the American Revolution: 1763 to 1780
5. “Gateway to Empire” – settlement of the Chicago portage (“The Gateway”) towards the War of 1812
6. “Twilight of Empire” – through Black Hawk’s War: 1830s

Other Eckert books include “The Court-martial of Daniel Boone” and “A Sorrow in Our Heart: The Life of Tecumseh” which fit in well after “The Wilderness War”.",BernardFerguson1944,2023-04-14T04:31:55Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Last of the Mohicans,1
190p9h0_1,190p9h0,"This is kind of an odd situation since I would never put those three writers together in terms of style, output, or literary respect. I would say all are remembered for their literary contributions and are certainly not ""forgotten"" today?

Cooper made a big impact in his time as the first major American novelist, but I think now he's seen as a comparative lightweight in the group (he has been pretty famously raked across the coals for his writing style) who wrote some frontier adventure tales that are somewhat remembered today, although the most famous one (The Last of the Mohicans) was to me vastly improved by Michael Mann in adaptation.

Jack London's body of work is still pretty respected overall (especially *The Call of the Wild, White Fang*, *Martin Eden,* and the lesser-known *All Gold Canyon*), and he wrote some fantastic stuff. His *The Sea Wolf* is one of my all-time favorite novels -- even though I feel like he caved when it came to a third act  -- and the character of Wolf Larson will always be a terrific and memorable literary achievement to me. 

When it comes to Nabokov, I'm not a fan, personally, but I would definitely say he is acknowledged as a superb talent and that *Lolita* is still regarded as a masterpiece.",DumpedDalish,2024-01-08T18:04:35Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Last of the Mohicans,1

I'd suggest From Here To Eternity by James Jones as a candidate for your list.",dancerlottie,2023-02-06T23:12:36Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Last of the Mohicans,1
