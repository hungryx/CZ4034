z3aqav_1,z3aqav,I read Paradise Lost before Frankenstein and I was curious why Paradise Lost was one of the books he finds near the fire. It turns out Mary Shelly’s husband wrote a famous essay where he argued that Lucifer was the tragic hero of the story. I think this a cool little hit of meta literature that makes the book itself more interesting and alive.,Zoravor,2022-11-24T08:29:37Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1

It wasn't long before i was completely entranced by this book.

So many amazing and unforgettable happenings and moments of dread and portent. I could not stop reading it! 

I have very little patience for the films anymore and as far as I can see, the film with the most reverence for the book is ""Young Frankenstein""!

On a side note: a few years ago John Kessel came out with a book ""Pride and Prometheus"". It is an expertly marvelous melding of ""Frankenstein"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"".🤯

Improbably interweaving and/or continuing the events of both novels (with a healthy respect for both), it is an amazing achievement, and honors both books.

There's also tons of evidence that her husband, Percy Shelley, had a massive hand in writing the story. Frankenstein features several quotes and poems from Percy.

There was a Greek author Lucien of Samosata who wrote about traveling to other planets and interacting with beings there in his work A True Story, written in 200 CE.

The creature has no community, no sense of belonging, nothing to tether it to a peaceful existence save a love of nature and literature.

z3aqav_77,z3aqav,"Wrong. The first interaction with humans is with Viktor himself, and the first thing Viktor does is pass out at the site of the creature before running away for three days. Charming.

The next humans he comes across is a man in a hut on the edge of the woods, who shrieks at the site of the creature, terrified, and runs off. Then the creature comes across a village full of people who do the exact same thing and run at the site of him. That's when the creature realizes humans ain't it and decides to not interact with them. THEN he comes across the family in the hovel at the edge of a town--only it's not a blind daughter, but a blind father.

Yes, he lives in their wall (kind of) and spies on them. Yes, he steals from them and they're already poor. But he also doesn't know what poverty or economic hardship is, and once he does, he starts doing shit for the whole family like a secret monster fairy godmother. He ""Days of Their Lives"" their asses and watches them to learn everything Viktor failed to teach--about human society, culture, language, literature, history, social relationships, family dynamics, and how he fits, (or rather doesn't fit), into all of it. 

He reads books and it deepens his desire to integrate with humanity. After months of secretly living next to this family, he tries to have a conversation with the blind father, and even tho the two are getting on well, what happens? The family returns home and the son and daughter chase the creature off before even speaking to him because he looks grotesque. 

The straw that breaks the camels back? He finds notes in his coat pocket that belong to Viktor, written shortly before the creature's creation, detailing the disgusting and horrifying nature (see: made of corpses) of the creature. He also sees how disgusted his own creator is with his creation. 

At what point is the creature given a chance to survive peacefully? He is an aberration of nature, human yet not, despised by everyone he meets, yet desperate to belong. Should he just spend a miserable life parallel to humanity, always yearning for more? Or should he just abandon civilization and fuck off into the night? But also, why SHOULD he go peacefully into the night? Humans who cross paths with him seek to destroy him for simply existing. His creator hates him. He has every right to hate humanity right back, in its entirety, yet he saves his hatred for his creator, and though he kills others, he does so to torture Frankenstein, thus putting their lives on his conscience.

I am not saying Frankenstein's creature is Good, by any means, but I'm not comfortable calling him Evil, either. He is a singular entity at odds with a world that wants nothing to do with him, a spark of creation openly spurned by its creator.

lqvxk8_12,lqvxk8,"It's much easier and less controversial to make a movie about a scary ""monster"" who is simply a monster. That Frankenstein created the monster, who actually has a predisposition to love, curiosity, kindness, and social belonging makes it a narrative on questions about identity of the self and morality in general. 

The true climax is not that Frankenstein made a creature that then ravished the world in violence, it's that he comes to question if he has a moral duty to provide an equal, a companion, to the monster, and eventually how he decides to sacrifice everything for the safety of humanity by destroying the second creation before it is complete. That destruction seals his fate with the monsters, and his price is a life of torment and suffering. It was originally subtitled: ""or: a modern Prometheus"" and I argue that it was this destruction of the second creature which made Frankenstein the modern Prometheus, as Prometheus gave the gift of fire to man and suffered eternal punishment from the gods for the transgression. Frankenstein likewise spares humanity of a race of hideous and potentially deadly monsters but loses everything for it.

lqvxk8_25,lqvxk8,"So the first Frankenstein film from 1931 was practically made as if the story was told via the telephone game. It was adapted from a play that was adapted from the book. And apparently the play took a lot of artistic license - she was the origin of the monster being named Frankenstein. But the 1931 film does have similarities to the book - Elizabeth is still there, the creature is afraid of fire, and there is humanity in him. He is very child like in his naivety. 

The film is received well! By June 1932, it had grossed $1.4 million. So studios want to build on that success and make more Frankenstein movies. But there's no other Frankenstein book, so now they are basically writing fan fiction of an adaptation that was already pretty much fan fiction. (No hate on fan fiction! But that's kind of what's happening here.) 

They're making it up, and they decide the next thing should be a lady creature. So they make Bride of Frankenstein in 1935.  So now, the creature is a monster film character that is moving farther and farther away from Shelley's novel. They want to make sequels or other films with this successful character and they have to keep the audience interested by upping the ante. They make The Ghost of Frankenstein in 1942, Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man in 1943, The Curse of Frankenstein in 1957, and the Evil of Frankenstein in the 60s.

By that point, Frankenstein as the film creature feature is more dominant in popular culture, as it is an iconic image that is on posters, in magazines, Halloween costumes, etc. 

I would recommend Branaugh's version for accuracy. His portrayal of Victor is wild and dramatic... But Victor was wild and dramatic.",natelyswhore22,2021-02-24T05:18:02Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,25

Have you actually watched James Wale’s 1931 Frankenstein or ‘35s Bride of Frankenstein? Or do you just have a vague conception of them from popular culture.

While they make serious edits and changes to the narrative the idea of the monster being a tragic and misunderstood figure was pretty central to those adaptations. And while Bride certainly embellished things even further, parts of the book that were left out of the original such as The Monster’s “friendship” with the blind man in the woods are reintroduced. As is his need for companionship. Together 31 and Bride offer a pretty complete picture of Shelly’s Frankenstein in theme and character even if some of the plot details get changed.

Sure once the Universal Monster version had moved past those initial films into never ending sequel territory like Frankenstein Vs The Wolf Man or Abbot and Costello Meet the Monsters things went way off the books. But that happens with cheap cash ins.

Also while there was some unnecessary violence introduced and its quality is somewhat up for debate, Kenneth Branagh's 1990s version with DeNiro as the monster, much of that film remained even more faithful to the book.",Brad3000,2021-02-24T07:58:38Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,30

lqvxk8_37,lqvxk8,"I was absolutely floored when I first read Frankenstein (the original 1818 edition). It still blows my mind that Mary Shelley was only 18 when she wrote it. It’s an amazing novel, and one of my favorites to this day. I think a lot of the issues surrounding the adaptations were brought up in another comment, because the original version of the novel really is aggressively atheistic (which would make sense because Mary Shelley was the daughter of two of the most well-known radical activists of the time - her mother was Mary Wollstonecraft, often considered by a lot of people to be the mother of modern feminism), and the parallels that the monster (or Adam, as he names himself, which I love to call him) sees within himself to Satan while reading Paradise Lost. Obviously changes had to be made when people adapted the story, and Shelley added some of those revisions to the 1831 version of the text, but man... that original 1818 story is so good. It’s a tale of hubris, seeking your own meaning to life, and quite honestly, there are some amazing depictions of multiple kinds of depression too (which makes sense, as well, because Mary Shelley struggled with depression and I believe she even had either a miscarriage or a stillbirth right before she wrote the novel).

I still have hopes that one day we can really see a true adaptation of the original novel rather than the pop culture version. The closest we got was Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein in the 90s with Robert De Niro but that still missed the mark in several places. I think the only way to really do the story justice is to make it as like a miniseries or something, with 5 or 6 one-hour episodes to really do the density of the text justice.",trans_pands,2021-02-24T13:16:39Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,37

lqvxk8_45,lqvxk8,"Mary Shelley believed that all humans were human. At the time, there were (among white British people) two prevailing scientific theories about human development. One was that white Europeans were human, evolved from ape species, and that Black people were a 'missing link' between white Europeans and ape species (i.e., that Black people were an inferior step on the evolution to white Europeans). The other prevailing scientific theory was based in Biblical interpretation; all people were descended from Adam and Eve, and that differences in skin color and facial features between people were due to environmental differences.

Shelley herself was heavily influenced by her parents,  William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft. Godwin was an abolitionist and believed in equality; he thought the slave trade was evil, that Black people were human beings with equal rights, and wrote stories and did journalism about the slave trade. Mary Wollstonecraft shared these beliefs, and was also a feminist; she wrote ""A Vindication of the Rights of Woman."" Mary Wollstonecraft died when Mary Shelley was very young, but her mother's writing influenced her.

The 'Creature' in 'Frankenstein' represents Mary Shelley's observations of how we dehumanize others, and treat people that are human as less than human based on their origins. The story is about slavery. In the end, the Creature fights back against the evils of his master and creator, and no one is left better from the experience.

This understanding of the story isn't merely a modern take; the piece is an allegory about the central evils of oppression in her time. To me, it's no surprise that other audiences didn't see the evils of Slavery in it. Frankenstein's creation is a slave, and it doesn't surprise me that modern renditions of the story rendered the slave as the evil one in the story.",effdot,2021-02-24T16:13:48Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,45

It’s very interesting to look at Shelley’s personal experiences with family after reading this too and draw comparisons to that dynamic. Also the time in which she was writing. I might be looking at it too deeply and it could just be a good story she wrote with encouragement from friends but most authors draw from experiences and I felt that those themes came through particularly strong in story. 

Im sorry to sound like a bit of a hipster or high brow, but I think Hollywood has adapted it over the years because they new that those themes were too hard to access for the public en masse and it was much easier to portray a monster as a monster. I’m talking about the very early adaptions. And since then the iconic evil “FRANKENSTEIN!” Has carried through. Most people wouldn’t know that Frankenstein is the maker and not the monster himself unless they’d read the book. 

In a way I’m not even sorry because it preserves the books as something different. It’s *SO* different from the books that I can view them as different entities and not mangled/ruined versions of the same story.",Paradox711,2021-02-24T12:02:45Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,52

lqvxk8_62,lqvxk8,"Well, first off, consider how long it takes to read a novel, and Frankenstein in particular. It's language is extremely ""lofty"" and dated. Now consider reading it in the time it takes to watch a movie. You just can't do it. We're not supposed to experience books that way. So, most novels must be greatly simplified or otherwise excerpted in order to fit into the length of a film. Frankenstein is so layered. It would be quite a feat to capture all the narratives in one film.

Plus, movies are a completely different experience from books. They are designed to be experienced in a few short hours, and move at the same pace for every viewer. I am a huge movie buff, but a movie is a short-lived experience. Books allow us to ""live"" in that world for quite some time.

It's definitely not impossible for pop-culture to shift the perception of the story closer to Shelley's original vision, but I think that the modern day story has a lot to do with taking something that's seen as having market potential and morphing it in order to make it easier to sell. I mean, a funny-looking green guy with bolts sticking out of his neck will probably have a much wider appeal when Halloween comes around every year rather than the original story, for better or for worse.

lqvxk8_127,lqvxk8,"I don't actually know, I'm just guessing, but my theory is this:

The book is not a nice book. It makes some really, *really* dark assumptions about human nature, stuff that Victorian society wasn't exactly comfortable with. So it makes sense that the book wasn't exactly table conversation when it came out. It was a good book, but people weren't really ok with discussing grave robbing, man's inhumanity to man, or the idea that a well-to-do family would produce a charming sociopathic vivisectionist obsessed with infringing upon the purvue of a jealous deity. At least, not at the dinner table.

So of course there would be bastardized, white-washed versions of the story floating around, ripe to be repeated to simple audiences at bars and parties in place of the actual, morally difficult story in the book. Especially the part where a man (mortal, non-divine) is capable of creating Adam, who is objectively better than merely human (thus outperforming the christian God in terms of creation). What Man creates must necessarily be inferior, if the priests are to be believed. Adam must have been flawed, or it becomes blasphemy.

By the time the first movie was produced, one of the major social causes of the day was the treatment of morons and simpletons (their terms) in asylums. That man's creation must be flawed was considered necessary; that audiences might sympathize with a shy yet terrifying simpleton was an angle chosen to sell tickets. Adam was stripped of all pretense of civility, made feral and stupid, but they were smart enough to leave him his *humanity* despite that (otherwise he would just be a boring sort of monster).

And so the story becomes a case-study in the failures of man at playing God, and the failures of the flawed offspring of that exercise to integrate in our world. Victor became a madman rather than a disappointed dreamer, because who else but a madman would dare to create life? And the villagers became terrified rabble because, politically, it was seen as useful to make the hamfisted point that Adam must have fared better in the dungeons of an asylum than out free in the world able to bother righteous folk.

And in its way, it's a perfect moral tragedy. Man's reach exceeds his grasp, and so his offspring is stuck as a clan-less alien in a hostile world because of it. Rather than an unflinching look at obsessive drive leading to dark ends, it became a religious morality play on the silver screen because that's what audiences--and investors--wanted to see.

Edit: accidentally posted early.

Cont'd: Remakes initially tried to capture the magic money-generation of the silver screen, rather than the spirit of the story. As it entered the zeitgeist, even filmmakers who knew better would stop themselves. People will pay more to see things they are already familiar with, and that's the Frankenstein that people had grown up with. It was what they expected, and so what studios thought they wanted. The movies rehashed the hyper-simplified, wildly inaccurate ideas of the first movie, because that's what audiences would pay for.",,2021-02-24T10:21:50Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,127

The novel quickly became fodder for popular entertainment at the end of the 1800’s and beginning of the 1900’s, particularly in British and other European music halls. These productions really leaned into the gothic horror elements of the story and due to the performances being staged in music halls, which tended towards melodrama, the productions largely skipped over the story’s more complex and subtle themes. This is the point where Frankenstein as a story became reduced down to more easily recognisable tropes such as the Byronic antihero with Dr Frankenstein, the dumb-show villain with the Creature, the love interest with the Bride and of course, Igor as comic relief. Early cinematic versions of the story built on these pre-existing horror melodramas, resulting in the dominant pop culture version of Frankenstein we have today.

Yes. That is entirely the point. Shelley was writing within the context of the early 1800s Romantic movement, so the horror is not the monster himself but how he came about - a perversion of Nature where a man gives birth.

Popular conceptions of *Frankenstein* are more than likely rooted in the Universal monster movies of the 1930s, so depictions often feature a big industrial lab with electrodes when no such thing ever entered Shelley's imaginings. Like how vampires were associated with opera capes for the longest time (also, the original *Dracula* had a mustache and walked in sunlight).",scythianlibrarian,2021-02-24T13:08:50Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,144

The book version is a larger societal creature, a byproduct of man's curiosity, desire, and greed, and imbued with many of humanity's emotional responses to their surroundings.

lqvxk8_188,lqvxk8,"Contextually, Frankenstein must be understood through the lens of Shelley’s main inspiration for the novel: Prometheus. In fact, the full title of the novel is Frankenstein; or The Modern Prometheus. The monster is a monster not because of the qualities of the being’s character, but because of the method of creation. Like Prometheus, who stole from the gods and was punished, Victor goes beyond what is considered human limitations by creating life.

Victor is aghast not because his creature is hideous outwardly (as many interpret and try making it into a novel about being nice to those who are different), but because he thinks he has sinned, so to speak, by playing god. The idea within the theological lens of the time was that humans, as creations, are not supposed to play creator.

The novel is incredibly philosophical, which doesn’t make the most interesting of stage plays or movies. So the characters are changed drastically for a different medium. But the novel itself can almost be read as a sci-fi horror, where a character does something no one thought scientifically possible, which brings about unintended consequences.

Additionally, a movie script obviously isn't going to be able to contain every word/scene of a book. They're two different mediums. You'll encounter this with pretty much all adapted work not just movie --> book. 

What I was surprised about is not that Frankenstein is a thinking character, hell, I even think there are a lot of adaptions that show this side of his character(Penny Dreadful for example). What I was surprised about was that thee whole Dr. Frankenstein is the real monster narrative that gets pushed so often was all bullshit IMO. There was even an essay suggesting this in the edition I read. Personally, Victor is no saint, but he certainly is far from a monster. 

I emphasized with him more than I did Frankenstein. He is basically a man overpowered with an obsession for knowledge that breaks a line that should never be crossed before sacrificing his family and life to make sure he never does it again.

But yeah, there are A LOT of stories people know through popular culture that are actually quite different from what they were when they were originally published. Dracula, Frankenstein, the Little Mermaid, the Snow Queen (which was part of the inspiration for Frozen), the Hunchback of Norte Dame, Aladdin, arguably Jekyll & Hyde (Hyde is actually pretty intelligent in the original story and Jekyll spends most of the original book unafraid of him, though the fearful side everyone associates with Jekyll nowadays DOES become part of the story later on)...basically, assume every famous version of an character adapted from a work of fiction is not what they actually were like in the original work and you'll be right more often than not (and not even in a nitpicky ""ahkchewly"" way: even if the basic character is right, there'll usually still be stuff which will have you going ""woah, I didn't think this character would have done this from the version I knew of them"").

I honestly find it quite fascinating to go back to these characters, as it's quite interesting to see what ideas were present from the beginning and how those ideas were used (if they were used at all) to form the image they're known for today. It's kind of like how surprising it can be for people to listen to early Black Sabbath if you're used to the image of heavy metal music as fast paced music with someone screaming their lungs out into the microphone: you go in expecting that and then you get hit with a very slow, audibly blues influenced sound (albeit very downtuned) that leaves you wondering how the hell this sound turned into, say, Metallica or Avenged Sevenfold.",NemoAtkins2,2021-02-24T13:05:52Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,201

lqvxk8_220,lqvxk8,"I have a little bit different take, although I agree with your point. Science and the ethics of dabbling in “God’s work” with the creation of life can certainly be debated. But I don’t find science the main culprit of what Frankenstein’s monster became as I do the sociological aspects of his upbringing. For all practical purposes, Dr. Frankenstein was the father of his creation. And like all children, his creation was looking to be loved. When he was shunned and cast out by his creator, he became the product of his loveless upbringing and the isolation that he endured by a society that shunned and hated him. I really believe that given a normal and caring upbringing, his creation wouldn’t have become the monster that he became. Prisons are full of people, that if raised in a loving and nurturing environment wouldn’t have arrived later in life the hardened and lost spirits they are. 

But that’s the beauty of great literature...it appeals to people in so many ways. This book has a really cool backstory too.

Frankenstein is the catalyst for everything bad that occurs in the book, sure, and is one of the morally wrong characters, but the monster also commits lots of murder of innocent people for terrible reasons. Even taking into account the sympathetic reading and empathizing with his reasons, the fact remains that the monster is a highly intelligent creature that chooses to allow his mistreatment (and later his desire for a wife and children) become obsessive sticking points to the extent that he goes on to cause as much pain as possible to the man he believes responsible. His final dialogue in the book indicates this as well, that he devoted his entire existence to revenge and regrets it, just before going off and killing himself (or saying he would, though a lot of readings see him as probably too egotistical to have gone through with it).

Both Frank and the monster are terrible, terrible people with the intelligence and moral knowledge to know what they do in the book is wrong. Both are also sympathetic as to their motivations and reasons for doing those wrong things, but that doesn’t justify either, and just because the Doctor is a sack of shit and started things doesn’t mean the monster can’t be.",WeeweeFunAccount,2021-02-24T06:46:19Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,222

Guy would have to cover literally every piece of skin he had and wear sunglasses to hide his eyes and I guess say he was a basketball player to not stand out as a freakish monster.

Erik is described as corpse-like and is referred to as having a ""death's-head"" (human skull) throughout the story. He has no nose, and his eyes are sunken so deep in his skull that all is seen are two eye sockets, except when his yellow eyes glow in the dark. His skin is yellowed and tightly stretched across his bones, and only a few wisps of dark brown hair are behind his ears and on his forehead.

His mouth is never described in as much detail, but is referred to as a “dead mouth” by Christine, and Erik acknowledges that his mouth is abnormal when lifting up his mask to display ventriloquism. He is described as extremely thin, so much so that he resembles a skeleton. Christine graphically describes his cold, bony hands, which also either feel or smell like death. There is debate among both English and French speakers as to whether the original French word used here, sentir, was intended by Leroux to mean ""smells like"" or ""feels like,” as the French word is used for both feel and smell depending on the context.

lqvxk8_249,lqvxk8,"Sure, the 'profane' aspect can be seen in contemporary reception of the original story. There was a dedication to Shelley's father, William Godwin in the original release, who was a notorious radical figure in England at the time for a whole host of his own personal beliefs. As far as those related to the book, critics were wary of subversive, atheistic themes in the story, and that the very subject matter of a man making life from his own hand is ghastly. The Quarterly Review had this to say in 1818:

> ""Our taste and judgement alike revolt at this kind of writing, and the greater the ability with which it is executed the worse it is--it inculcates no lesson of conduct, manners, or morality; it cannot mend, and will not even amuse its readers, unless their taste has been deplorably vitiated.""

The Edinburgh Magazine said it was 'bordering too closely on impiety', and was perhaps even more dangerous than Godwin's works. If I recall correctly, the book released during the time there was great uproar about the vitalism movement (which I am in no way familiar enough with to articulate the exact impact which would've been inflicted on the book's reception), and the parallels drawn in Frankenstein quickly earned it a more sacrilegious air about the public. Certainly not everyone dismissed the story, and some early reviews were quite taken by it, but by and large it was a controversial release.

Thus, the first stage play of the book very deftly redirected the story into a version much more in line with what we're familiar with today in the classic monster movie, with a good bit more Christian moralizing from Frankenstein himself, who recognizes his transgression as profane, where he never even broaches the topic in the original text, which is almost entirely secular.

As for Shelley altering the 1831 text, I can't tell you all the differences off the top of my head, but it's thought that she was inspired by the adaptations of the story by then, and rewrote several speeches in the book to characterize Victor Frankenstein as a more explicit victim of great evils, being pushed by some compulsion to his creation, then recognizing his own impiety to his own horror afterwards, unable to protect himself and his family and friends from a cruel fate. The 1818 version gives him significantly more agency, by comparison. Allusions to contemporary and fringe sciences were also removed, distancing the text from controversial topics. I'm sure you can find an exhaustive breakdown online somewhere, I have not personally read the 1831 edition all the way through; the main takeaway is that Shelley seemingly looked to the popular stage play for inspiration in revising her work to respond/cater to more conservative audiences, which met her original story with a lot of backlash.

That's why, even though the 1831 text was the dominant one for many years, in recent decades the 1818 text has risen to popularity, being seen by many as a more faithful representation of Shelley's vision.

If you want to know more about such matters, the Second Norton Critical Edition of Frankenstein has a ton of supplementary material, which was what I primarily drew upon for this response, and my own general knowledge about the context surrounding the book.",Admiral_of_Crunch,2021-02-24T12:34:57Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,249

lqvxk8_257,lqvxk8,"Not that I'm condoning what Frankenstein did, but it's not unbelievable in context.

Frankenstein is from a wealthy and respected family. He is horrified by his own creation, he only sees it as a monster and his own personal failing. So what is he going to do? Run around claiming he brought a pieced-together corpse to life and that the nanny didn't murder William, it was this creature he created months ago and didn't tell anyone about? He'd almost certainly be labeled insane and lose the respect of everyone around him, potentially damaging the reputation of his family as well. 

There's no reason anyone *should* believe him, he didn't have any real proof of his accomplishment. And say people did somehow believe him, then what? He's a mad scientist who played God and created a ""monster"". So he still runs the risk of damaging his family's reputation and being ostracized.

I'm not defending Victor's actions, he was unnecessarily cruel to his creation and took no responsibility for his actions, but at the end of the day I don't think it's out of character. Victor was a pretty vain individual. He picked out parts for the creature in an attempt to make it almost an Adonis-like figure. Then when the creature didn't live up to his expectations, rather than being impressed with the fact that he's quite literally created life, he was horrified and abandoned it. Even after being confronted and realizing the creature was intelligent he tried to hunt it down because he viewed it as a monster.

Thinking about it that way, I could absolutely see Victor neglecting to tell other people to prevent from being looked down upon, whether it's because they think he's insane or whether it's because they too are horrified by what he's created.

The creature does terrible things but if you argue that Shelley was playing around with the Tabula Rasa philosophy of the time--it's hard to feel that there was any other sort of outcome for him (except commiting suicide earlier on maybe?) I'm not saying that the creature doesn't have any agency--but to me its always reminded of the ""if the child is rejected by the village it will burn it down to feel its warmth"" saying.

lqvxk8_267,lqvxk8,"I feel like this ignores all of the Creature's attempts to coexist peacefully with humanity, and literally every time he is rejected by people. First by Victor, then the first common folk he comes across in the wild, and finally the DeLacey family, his pseudo-adoptive family that don't know they've adopted a monster, and promptly turn on him when they do.  

The Creature isn't human, yet he feels and thinks as a man would, desires companionship where none is to be found. This abberration of nature, which should not exist, and is absolutely and utterly solitary in its existence, is still cursed with the desires of a normal man. To feel wanted and needed and loved. Yet there is no one. The Creature is created and exists in a time and place wherein his mere existence is seen as evil, and he is treated as such. What sort of an existence can the Creature reasonably expect in a world that views him as, at best, a strange threat that should not exist, and at worst, an unholy beast that is innately evil?

I'm not disagreeing that the Creature does commit evil acts. He does. He kills Henry Clerval, Victor's best friend, and Elizabeth, Frankenstein's bride-to-be, out of spite when Victor refuses to make the Creature a bride of his own, and he kills Victor's brother out of anger and vengeance for being abandoned, and frames the housekeeper. All terrible things. 

But his only options are plead with a creator and master that wants nothing to do with him to make more, throw himself at the mercy of mistrustful humans (who have already tried to destroy him multiple times), flee humanity and live in eternal exile, or kill himself. And we go through them all to some extent. 

Sure, the Creature could have abstained from uneccessary bloodshed, but why? Why should the Creature see any value in the life of humans when they see no value in his? Why should the moral impetus be on the Creature, this thing that shouldn't exist and barely understands the wider world, and not the humans around him? No one even treats the Creature with a semblance of humanity, but we expect the Creature to show restraint when the rest of the humans in the book don't? Shelley does an excellent job of making the point that evil begets more evil, and the evil of men is often of their own making.",IrvineGray,2021-02-24T16:37:14Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,267

It's THIS that people respond to - the fact that he is not a part of nature. That's the hideousness that sets the monster apart.

While it is true that the creature killed his wife, it was Victor Frankenstein's fault as well. He lied, especially to himself and was a creature as remote from the truth as Pluto from the sun. But the creature has the virtue of truth, and did not lie and had warned Frankenstein of what he would do. And all Frankenstein had to do to save the woman he loved was not to wed her. And so he was an accomplice to uxoricide

w0i8n0_49,w0i8n0,He left his creation to wander about with no education. The first person the creature killed he was hoping he could raise and teach to not judge people based on appearance but then the child screamed and said his father was Frankenstein. Thinking he meant Victor killed that child in rage (which is horrible he in now way deserved to die for sharing a blood line). He set up the girl but Victor knew she was innocent and did damn near nothing to help her. The creature then asked for a wife and then would leave society alone. At first Victor refuses and then decided to but then realizes its a bad idea and destroys her and the creature sees this. Thus creature basically says you killed my wife I will kill yours only Victor thinks that the creature will kill him not his wife so he only protects himself (this doesnt make it his fault she died and she did not deserve to die either).

w0i8n0_53,w0i8n0,"Sure but it's the kind of debate a high school teacher assigns their class because it feels easy for them to grasp, and the actual goal isn't really to analyze that specific text but to hone the skills used to analyze media in general. Which is worthy usually, but falls apart here because Frankenstein isn't really about morality and certainly not a cautionary tale of mans hubris or whatever, and by focusing on that the point is entirely missed. It's an approach that makes the story so much less than it is. 

Frankenstein is about the horror and monstrosity of identity being inescapably tied to their body, and how social role are seemingly enforced by bodily imperative. In particular shelly draws on her own experience of that, being a smart, educated woman living in the 1800s in a society that views femininity as  deviant and Other and inherently defiled. 

I should at least briefly note here the tension between Mary Shelly's writing in Frankenstein and her mother's writing. Throughout A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft argues that Reason ought be the true source of culture, not gross physical nature; she present utopian vision of society as an androgynous one, where one's sex and one's body are only relevant at the points where society and biology actually intersect (sexual attraction, procreation, etc). Mary Shelly, unfortunately, never found that vision within her grasp, never able to escape the cruelty of a hyper pateraical society.  The themes of motherhood and sexuality and guilt and creation/procreation and defilement and death and how they're interlinked in the narative is the true meat of the text. It's why the driving force of the books conflict is how the creature is so utterly and thoroughly cursed, even in his own eyes, by the brutal reality of his own body. 

One of the issues with the morality tale view is in how it handles comparisons between Victor and Milton's Satan (especially those targeted at american highschool students). The oft focus is on Victor's hubris and transgression against nature, casting Victor as the villain and what results as just (perhaps divine) punishment.  But in reality that's utterly divorced from the actual context of the Romantic view of Milton's Satan. The Romantics view of Milton's Satan was not one of a villain, but an almost hero; see Byron's *Cain* and particularly Lucifer's monologue within it, as well as Percy Shelly's *On the Devil, and Devils*. To them Milton's Satan was as an symbol for humanity struggle against the cruelty and control of superstition. The parallel of Victor and Milton's Satan is twin to the parallel with Prometheus (The gift of fire being metaphorical for the gift of reason the light of which casts superstition away), neither of which ought be read as negative. The source of both suffering for both Milton's Satan and Prometheus is not presented as a moral failing but a result of them stepping beyond their limits and setting themselves against a force immeasurably beyond them. They're monstrous because they've set themselves against the order those superior forces have set for them. Likewise Victor's suffering stems not from moral failing, but is a simple consequence of setting the power of his own Reason against the immeasurably greater might of Nature and failing that contest. 

As a bit of trivia we should also note that the first way God is named in Paradise lost is as  Victor [...into what Pit thou seest from what highth fall'n, so much the stronger prov'd He with his Thunder: and till then who knew the force of those dire Arms? Yet not for those, nor what the Potent Victor in his rage can else inflict...]. It's not a at all coincidence that's Frankenstein's first name. 

Victor's folly and suffering is symbolic of the conflict Wollstonecraft's Utopia and the gross physical reality of being a woman in the 1900s Mary Shelly and other women of her age experienced. His is the horror of seeing how far his desires exceeded his grasp and the sheer force he struggled against (""...and till then who knew the force of those dire Arms?""). The creatures suffering is thus tied to and dual with Victor's, and likewise symbolic. His is the horror of being damned by society and denied any form of humanity, even by his father and creator, simply because of his body.  

We should also note that for all the Creature refers to himself as Victor's Adam, Mary Shelly deliberately and pointedly parallels him to Milton's Eve. The way he describes seeing himself in the pool of water to Victor is outright parodic of Eve's awakening to consciousness in Paradise Lost. I'll quote that section down at the end of this, but it's worth comparing to that scene in chapter 12.  Without getting into a whole analysis of paradise lost, the ultimate source of Eves fall and her rejection of the order of Eden is the secondness and otherness of her existence; her desire to be more than she was created to be is the 'flaw' by which is she temped to eat the fruit, gaining both knowledge and sin. This has already gotten the hell long enough, but note the influence of Original Sin on Christian philosophy and  how the European view of femininity and womanhood as inherently dangerous and defiled was developed. Also note the parallels to the creatures own flaws and how they stem from his desire to be more than he was created, and how that drives his fall 

Victor isn't a great person, but he's also not the villain. Neither is the Creature. Both are doomed from the very beginning by forces far beyond their control or ken, and their suffering stems from their futile struggle inspite of that. 

Anyhow: Eve's description of her awakening in Eden. It's book 4 line 440 if you'd like it in full context and without reddit butchering the formatting. ""from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh,"" is also noteworthy here given the source of materials for the Creatures creation; very literally the flesh of man.    

>    To whom thus Eve replied.  O thou for whom	
And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh,
And without whom am to no end, my guide
And head! what thou hast said is just and right.

>    For we to him indeed all praises owe,
And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy
So far the happier lot, enjoying thee
Pre-eminent by so much odds, while thou
Like consort to thyself canst no where find.

>That day I oft remember, when from sleep
I first awaked, and found myself reposed                               
Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.

>Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
Of waters issued from a cave, and spread
Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved
Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went
With unexperienced thought, and laid me down
On the green bank, to look into the clear
Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky.

>As I bent down to look, just opposite                 		
A shape within the watery gleam appeared,
Bending to look on me:  I started back,
It started back; but pleased I soon returned,
Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks
Of sympathy and love:  There I had fixed
Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire,
Had not a voice thus warned me;  ""What thou seest,
""What there thou seest, fair Creature, is thyself;
""With thee it came and goes: but follow me,
""And I will bring thee where no shadow stays 
""Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, he
""Whose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy

w0i8n0_54,w0i8n0,"I think part of what makes him sympathetic is that he feels human feelings and was made to be human but he isn’t. His monstrous actions are seemingly out of human desperation but ultimately they just prove his creator right. He’s not human, and by extension his feelings are no longer valid.

I think ultimately we understand that he’s a monster because he hurts others as a means to an end, it’s not rage or hurt that fuels his killing; it’s his resignation to be the monster he was never intended to be. Frankenstein wanted to make the perfect man and bring the dead back to life, instead he made a monster.

I think the irony and futility of it all is what makes the story so versatile, everyone finds a different moral to the story and a different monster to condemn.  

Lastly I think I’d be wrong to ignore the monster fuckers here who just think it’s hot to have a brooding lonely 8ft patchwork bf. It’s fine to fuck a monster but not a murderer hence why people are so willing to ignore his crimes",mcduckinit,2022-07-16T17:50:44Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,54

From reading the original version, I felt that the monster wasn’t so much horrific & gruesome looking, but rather just ugly and big. But the point you make is very much the point of the book, Frankenstein is indeed the bad person, and the book explores his regret in great detail. He was so infatuated by the science and idea of reanimating a corpse that he lost himself along the research and was appalled at what he had done. Frankenstein recognises he did a bad thing, and themes of creator & creation is a theme worth exploring in the book. He realises his bad acts at the end, which is why he refuses to create a companion for his monster. But it leaves him in a peculiar dilemma because he has forsaken his creature to a life of loneliness.

I don't think it's fair to say he ""kills and kills"".

w0i8n0_70,w0i8n0,"In his 1981 nonfiction book *Danse Macabre*, Stephen King discussed Frankenstein at length. Regarding this moment in the story, King unsurprisingly made a salient point:

>At length, Victor agrees, and actually does make the woman. He accomplishes this second act of creation on a desolate island in the Orkney chain, and in these pages Mary Shelley creates an intensity of mood and atmosphere that nearly rivals the creation of the original. Doubts assail Frankenstein moments before he is to imbue the creature with life. He images the world desolated by a pair of them. Even worse, he imagines them as a hideous Adam and Eve of an entire race of monsters. A child of her times, Shelley apparently never considered the idea that for a man capable of creating life from moldering spare parts, it would be child's play to create a woman without the capacity for conceiving a child.

If any of you readers of fiction haven't read *Danse Macabre*, I think you really should, or at least should give it a look. I've lost count of the times I've re-read it, it's special to me in that very best way. When King really gets rolling with the subject matter (Chapter III), he lovingly talks - at length - of three special novels that to him have achieved a kind of immortality: *Frankenstein*, *Dracula*, and *Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*. 

He spends the rest of the book talking about horror on the radio (remember, this was written in 1981), on the television, in movies, and of course, in novels. Given how early in his career he wrote this, and given the forty-one years that have flown by since then (with all the horror content forty-one years would entail) ...

w0i8n0_73,w0i8n0,"That’s absolutely true, however, I recommend you look at people’s responses at the time.

The story is remembered as a horror story, not a science fiction story, not a literature story, it’s a horror story.

Is  the dude who solved the cube and let out the hellraiser the bad guy in the story? How about the guy who read from the necronomicon in evil dead? No? That’s because they’re horror stories.

Horror stories always begin with someone doing something they shouldn’t and then getting punished for it. Victor Frankenstein is the hero of the story, regardless of how things have changed from our understanding.

To view the story in a modern light and try to apply those actions to the Victorian age is foolish at best.

Remember in to kill a mockingbird the black dude gets hanged even though everyone knew the girl’s dad raped her? Those same people are the ones reading Frankenstein.

The cultural zeitgeist of Frankenstein is a horror story, and that’s because when it was released and when it came about that’s what it was.",Tianoccio,2022-07-16T22:49:14Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,73

w0i8n0_75,w0i8n0,"I would say the novel is very clear the Creature isn't inherently evil or bad, that his first instincts were neutral and kind. This doesn't absolve him of his evil, quite the opposite because his evil is quite conscious.  Victor thinks beauty = good.  Society hates the monster for how he looks.  Walton likewise begins so classist that he can think of no one as his fellow unless they are sufficiently well born and he's intoxicated by Victor's upper class handsomeness.

In the version where Elizabeth is not a cousin, in the rewrite which is SO much creepier than Victor marrying his cousin, the Frankensteins save her from poverty (and not her several siblings) and are ""helpful"" by taking her in from her living, poor parents who have too many mouths to feed; they save her because she's angelic looking and blond and too pretty to be poor, then they groom her to marry Victor from the age of like 7. Elizabeth is a good person, but the obsession with her beauty is clearly satirized in the novel.  

There are religious and mythic undertones and allusions in Frankenstein, but the notion that beauty = goodness really isn't supported as a theme itself.  Rather, Mary uses it to criticize society. 

One possible theme on Victor's hubris, that he was brought down by ""playing God"" is fair in some ways (though you can read the novel and very much think that if he'd welcomed and educated the Creature, it would be good, but of course that wouldn't make it welcomed by society). Hubris and pride are some of his frequent sins.  But it's a kind of ""easy out"" to say the creation was the issue.  When the Creature calls Victor his maker, he does criticize his mistake in creating him because he has a miserable existence but he more so criticizes him for abandoning him, leaving him all alone, being a neglectful and feckless god basically, shunning him for no crime.",berrieh,2022-07-17T14:00:12Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,75

It's not that the Monster did NOTHING WRONG, it's that at its creation, the Monster starts off as innocent, almost child-like.  The Monster isn't inherently evil, it becomes evil as the result of the life that is forced upon it, partly because of Victor's abandonment.  By the end, of course, the monster is truly a monster seeking revenge for the miserable existence Victor foisted on it.

Victor IS the true villain of the story, I don't see how anyone can read the book and not come to the conclusion.  Even Victor himself in the end acknowledges the atrocities he's unleashed upon the world.  If Victor hadn't either created the Monster or had actually taken care of the Monster after its creations then things would have gone differently.  This doesn't mean Victor was purely mustache-twirling evil, the point of the book is that even the best of intentions can lead to atrocities if you don't take care.",kia75,2022-07-16T23:53:30Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,76

w0i8n0_78,w0i8n0,"Oh yeah I agree, I believe it's really a societal critique. (Also I haven't read that rewrite, but yeah that does sound creepy...)

From an interpretation standpoint, however, I enjoy drawing themes of mankind being both gods in their own right (due to our insane power compared to other species) and still animals (due to our instinctual habits and our lack of emotional control). In a very basic explanation!

I like to look at the story from this point of view because it could be interpreted as very ironic that Frankenstein abandons his creation and since he could be paralleled to god in this situation you could posit that mankind (and so Frankenstein himself) is similarly abandoned.

You could also say that his monster is MORE human in that their emotional flaws are brought out and highlighted more and that the monster can recognize the neglect towards them. While humans in the story make similar mistakes, but they're sort of less criticized? If that makes sense? Because the narrator being human is more forgiving and wants to ignore some similarities.

All from an interpretation standpoint of course, I know it's not the intended message. There's just a lack of media that outright plays with these themes so I have to extrapolate a lot and Frankenstein was the first story I was able to extrapolate this from.

I do find outright moral good vs evil and similar religious interpretations sort of boring and lazy so I'm happy you pointed out some flaws of the interpretation. It's very much a more emotion driven story.

Edit Tldr: I know it's the wrong interpretation, I just think the recognition that beauty = good in Victor's eyes can help draw similarly wrong, but more interesting interpretations.",CopperPhish,2022-07-17T17:37:37Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,78

Now the average straight laced academic can see Satan as a Byronic hero, sure, and even see sympathy for ""why"" he's evil beyond that.  But that's after a lot more Romantic literature (Frankenstein is pretty early) and the post modern wave frankly. Byron was a famous figure of amorality. So his sympathies with Milton's Satan aren't necessarily proving the point that he's actively sympathetic. Byronic heroes became much more sympathetic in whole during the postmodern era than they were actually intended to be by the Romantics, who often didn't justify their evil with sympathies so much as see evil in all humans. It's an evolution of Milton's original point on sin, but the full tilt of justification of evil comes later. It's interesting to see how you'd read things like Paradise Lost or Frankenstein in different eras and sensibilities.",berrieh,2022-07-17T17:37:43Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,80
w0i8n0_81,w0i8n0,"There's literally no way for women to take the place in society she discusses without dismantling the patriarchal system of power in place. 

These quotes directly relate to criticizing the patriarchy. 

From Vindication:

""There must be more equality established in society, or morality will never gain ground, and this virtuous equakity will not rest firmly even when founded on a rock, if one half of mankind be chained to its bottom by fate, for they will be continually undermining it through ignorance or pride.""

""A virtuous man may have a choleric or a sanguine constitution, be gay or grave, unreproved, be firm till he is almost over-bearing, or weakly subsmissive, have no will or opinion of his own; but all women are to be levelled, by meekness and docility, into one character of yielding softness and gentle compliance.""

""Men, indeed, appear to me to act in a very unphilosophical manner when they try to secure the good conduct of women by attempting to keep them always in a state of childhood.""

""Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers - in a word, better citizens.""

""Considering the length of time that women have been dependent, is it surprising that some of them hug their chains, and fawn like the spaniel?"" (about internalized patriarchy) 

From another essay, not Vindication. I used to teach this one with Frankenstein:

""Women are systematically degraded by receiving the trivial attentions which men think it manly to pay to their sex, when, in fact, men are insultingly supporting their own superiority.""

There's plenty more. Wollstonecraft was the revolutionary type and was absolutely looking to dismantle the patriarchy. Yes, by elevating women to an equal place, as educated individuals, and she mentions the ""chains"" their kept in by systems of male superiority that were explicit.  The patriarchy in the 18th century isn't hard to explain at all, though to understand it in the 21st century where many of Wollstonecraft's desires about female freedom and education have been realized by several major societies (the globe is a big place) is trickier. See, those societies (ours) still have gender inequality but of course it's from these past shackles, even the removed ones, as much as current ones so, like any systemic issue (systemic racism etc), you have to understand the evolution from past to present, it's continued influence on socialization. 

For biological sex aspects of gender, you also have to understand the impacts of having a uterus, which has very different gender issues to Wollstonecraft's day, where women often understood the danger and burden of bearing children but had no major systems of family planning to rely on (not to say Wollstonecraft would've aborted her children, certainly not Mary who was very much wanted, but she definitely would've been pro choice and understood how motherhood and marriage were intertwined with patriarchal systems of power).",berrieh,2022-07-17T14:16:31Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,81
w0i8n0_82,w0i8n0,"I disagree, though not necessarily on the Creature being intentionally ""understandable"" per se.  I disagree on two points: 

1) that the shading of Milton's Satan was meant to *enhance* sympathy towards him.  In fact, I think that aspect serves to show the opposite: that his evil is intentional and wrong, though his initial motivations may be sympathetic. I think she uses techniques in other areas to make the Creature's trend towards evil ""logical"" and make his evil look avoidable and caused by society and his Creator though.  

2) that Mary intended Victor to be sympathetic in the first draft.  If you compare drafts, it does seem she intends him more sympathetic than the original publication in the second publication, which is nearly 15 years later (albeit still pretty unlikable, even then). But most of the edits that make him more sympathetic seem to be encouraged by Percy's suggestions if you look at the journals, and she adds other things to offset the additional insight into Victor's mind, such as the super creepy rewrite of Elizabeth as a poor girl who is ""adopted"" because she's blond and pretty and then is groomed to be Victor's bride, with Victor calling her ""mine"" (there's a little of this when she's Victor's cousin, but so much more in the rewrite). She also makes sure to elaborate further that Victor ""knows better"" as she elaborated on Alphonse's advice and that Victor remembers and ignores.  Unlike the more sympathetic changes (a few do give better insight into Victor's mind, even making him possibly look like he suffers a mental disorder in Ch. 4), these changes don't seem to have been suggested to Mary per se, besides not making Elizabeth a cousin (though the new story is SO much creepier). 

I guess I disagree on a 3rd part, which is that, far from no one being the villain in Frankenstein, I would say Shelley writes a tale of both Victor and the Creature being villains and only Captain Walton is given the chance of redemption, and while she hints he may take it with her Ancient Mariner allusions and the suggestion he's turning back, it's unclear if he'll reach full redemption. She makes both the Creature and Victor clearly and fully irredeemable, beyond a doubt. I would say if you focus on ""why"" style rationality, Victor's character is worse off for this, as he had all the privilege and support the Creature lacks and still continuously chooses selfishly.  But if you focus on actions, the Creature's evil is obviously far more evil in aggregation.

I think there are 2 villains in Frankenstein and the protagonist is actually Walton, but I can see other takes. He doesn't have the ""screen time"" to be a protagonist, unless you count sitting and listening, but he's the only character given capacity for change in the course of the actual plot.",berrieh,2022-07-18T11:30:54Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,82

We see Captain Waltons love for his sister, Victor's love for his siblings, the Frankenstein parents' love for their children, Justine's love for the family she helps care for, Victor's love for his friend Henry. These all serve to contrast with the way Victor treats his creation. The Creature is for all intents and purposes, Victor's own son. Victor brought him into the world, and should love him, but instead rejects him.  He doesn't even bother to give his son a name, instead just considering him a monstrous disgrace.

From the show notes:

When Mount Tambora erupted it spewed ash across the globe; blotting out the sun; poisoning crops; and bringing starvation, illness and death to millions. It may also have helped inspire great scientific and cultural advances - including the horror masterpiece Frankenstein. How well do we adapt to catastrophe and what are the limits of our ability to weather even the worst circumstances? ",sor2hi,2023-05-15T14:32:15Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,5
13i6qiv_6,13i6qiv,"I read Frankenstein for the first time for a class I was taking about the gothic literary genre. It is an amazing book, and Mary Shelley is rightfully credited for proliferating the science fiction genre.

Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein for a ghostwriting competition between herself, Lord Byron, and I believe her husband, Percy Shelley. She was only 18 years old when Frankenstein was published, which means she was barely 20 when writing the novel. Her husband, Percy, encouraged her to finish the book because he liked what he had read so far. 

If you like Frankenstein, then I think you may also enjoy Dracula. Much like Shelley's Frankenstein became the progenitor of the science fiction genre, Dracula became the progenitor of the modern vampire.

As an aside, I would love to study directly under Mary Shelley. She's a divine wordsmith in my eyes. Bram Stoker isn't nearly as eloquent, but then Dracula was published in 1897, almost 90 years later, so the English language would have evolved to resemble our more modern way of writing.",Olympian-Warrior,2023-05-15T16:15:56Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,6

Just think of the Asilomar Conference principles for recombinant DNA. It was organized by Maxine Singer and Paul Berg, who were scared what genetically modified bacteria might do.

13i6qiv_41,13i6qiv,"Some lesser known things about Mary Shelley

* Frankestein (The Modern Prometheus) was originally written by Mary when she was only around 20... 

* Her husband, Percival, would become a celebrated 'Romantic' poet of the period. Along with a close friend of theirs, Lord Byron (another celebrated Romantic poet), Percy and Mary made an effort to re-write the Classic Greek tale of 'Prometheus'... of the three, only Mary's version was completed and remains.

* The tale of Prometheus is related: >!Prom. was Zeus brother, who Zeus inflicted punishment upon, for gifting the race of man with 'Fire'. The gift from Prom. would come to liberate humanity from their animalism and prove that Zeus was wrong to wish to destroy them. Prom. was able to see the future and stayed his being killed by Zeus by teasing the idea that he knew who would come to kill Zeus in the future (Hercules). the motif here, which is shared with Frankenstein, is one of the god creating the man, who would come to kill the god (and his father)!<

* In Frankenstein, >!the 'Monster' is not responsible for Frankensteins death... that lies with Frankenstein alone.!<

* Mary's mother was Mary Wollestonecraft, auther of 'A Vindication of the rights of Women'. Mary's father was William Godwin, a celebrated Political theorist in his own life, who was also the first British philosopher to state 'I am an Anarchist'.

* Despite her (clearly radical) lineage, Mary and Percy felt the need to elope with each other, for fear of the judgement of British society regarding their political position(s). They were 'Free Love' practising, Atheistic, Church-Damning, King-Hating poets; I love them.

* The book itself tackles the whole notion of 'God creates Man / Man Kills God / God is Dead / Man creates God' about 50 odd years before Neitzsche considered writing it down... this lass was 20 years old...

* The whole spiel given by anyone that studied literature is as follows: 

> Those who havent read the book, think that Frankenstein is the Monster, >!but Frankenstein is actually the Doctor. Those who have read the book know that Frankenstein is the Doctor, and that the Monster has no name. Those that *understand* the book, realise that Frankenstein is the Monster!<.

I think it's misunderstood in the way you describe partly because Frankenstein's monster used to be seen in the public consciousness as just a monster. So people reacted against it to say ""actually it's Victor that's the true monster"". But you're right, the monster did some terrible things, intentionally, but at the same time it could have been averted if Victor had not run away from his responsibilities.

Scholars don’t dispute the initial concept originated from the mind of Mary Shelly, or that she wrote much of the early manuscripts. 

But the final published volume’s themes, language, worldview, philosophy, references to classic literature, writing style, etc. bear a remarkable similarity to Percy’s published works before and after Frankenstein—too much so to dismiss—but little to no resemblance to any of Mary’s subsequent writings throughout her life.

Then you look into the personal and business relationships between Percy, Mary, and her father and the puzzle pieces start to fall into place. (They *had to* convince her father the book was hers alone or it never would have been published).

There also has been tremendous pressure among literary academics to preserve Mary’s status as the sole author of Frankenstein, along with efforts to suppress records and documents indicating otherwise. It’s fascinating to read about.

Her mother was Mary Wollstonecraft, a proto-feminist writer of *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman', who died 10 days after her daughter was born. Mary Shelley's father was William Godwin, also a super well-known essayist at the time. 

She met Percy Shelley when she was 16 and he was 27 - and he was already married with two children. They supposedly consummated their relationship on her mother's gravestone. Percy and Mary ran off together despite him still being married - a few years later his wife committed suicide and soon after, Mary and Percy got married. 

It's also thought that *Frankenstein* was influenced by her being pregnant at the time of writing (and having had an earlier still-birth)- technically, she wasn't participating in the competition, but she had a dream about the creation scene in *Frankenstein* and supposedly Percy encouraged her to write it down. 

Lord Byron was good friends with Percy (and participated in the ghost story competition) - he is considered one of the first literary celebrities, despite his clubbed-foot. He ended up sleeping with Mary Shelley's step-sister (who may have also had an earlier relationship with Percy), and she became pregnant. 

Percy ended up dying with his son a few years later in sailing accident. And there is more to the drama that surrounded Mary Shelley, but that's the basics of some of the most fascinating bits.",slothface27,2023-05-15T14:46:49Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,55

Yearning to spend time with someone like him he desperately hunts down his creator to ask for a wife. Of course, instead of complying and believing his creature would cause no further harm if he could become a hermit with his new wifey, he denies the creation of another ""abomination"".

Yeah, Victor ""deserved"" what happened to him, the creature is just a victim. He didn't ask to be brought into this world, had to face the scorn of the people he tried to befriend and his own father treated him as a monster too.

*Prospero, back in Europe after the events of “The Tempest”, encounters Victor Frankenstein, who abandoned his search for the creature after an epiphany on his near deathbed.*

PROSPERO:

You, down low! That face you wear is  
Fit for none but scoundrels, knaves or wretches.

VICTOR:

Good sir, I am truly in a wretched state. I fear your judgment is sound, as my mind is not. A deep anguish has clutched my very essence. I feel the end is near. If only my soul could unburden itself, perhaps those who follow might elude the demons that hound me now.

PROSPERO:

Heed my warning! Fear for one who cedes to  
Hear your tale of woe, should give restriction  
To the urge. Do not my soul with trouble  
Cumber further. Woe betide me, likewise.

VICTOR:

Perhaps I can convey the meaning of my misery without the full explication of my deeds. I have distilled the wrongs I wrought so I may share without contaminating one of a more innocent nature. I would take kindly to the thoughts of one who is no stranger to melancholy of his own.

PROSPERO:

Well, a coward I am not, and nor the  
Keeper of a soul unsullied. Prithee,  
Make your peace and tell your tale. If I fall  
Ill with loathing and distaste, my feet walk  
Still through power of my own. I promise  
Not a thing to thee, say what thou wouldst and  
We will see how long I deign to listen.

VICTOR:

If only humility were a virtue of which I was possessed, I would not face you now with such affliction. I have lost all that was dear to me, all that I loved, for naught but the lust of revenge, revenge for a deed of which I was the cause. I could not trust the monstrous appearance of another, and give to him the affection that was his due as a creature on God’s earth, if not of His making. No man is an island; a soul without love will not thrive. Of this, I myself am living proof.

PROSPERO:

Hmm? A beast has plagued thee to despair? At  
Last it seems excited is my int’rest.  
Suffer not the suff’rings of a beast who  
Knows not ways of sons of Adam. Beasts are  
Here for naught but making less the load of  
Man. If serve a use he fails to do, concerns  
Are waste and only harm the bearer.

VICTOR:

This monster is capable of much more than you would expect. His cunning, quickness, strength, and stealth are not seen but in the most dangerous of rogues. Alas, he cultivated a sentimental nature most delicate, but was shewn no quarter in the hearts of men. I fear that in the end, it is I who am the beast. Do we not wish our fellow men charitable hearts in their dealings with us? If I had given as I had been so lucky to receive, perhaps this beast would have made a man of generous merit in turn.

PROSPERO:

Alas, delusion has encased your mind.  
A beast can no more be a man than fish  
Can fly or swine can sing. If bested you  
Have been, best you regroup and try again.  
The ruler of this earth is man, for God  
We strive to make things right, so that  
His children soundly sleep each, ev’ry night.

VICTOR:

But sir, you spoke of woe when first you came upon me. Why indeed would one so sure-footed as yourself be so distressed?

PROSPERO:

My sins be not against the beast, but men  
Who would see me deceased, my daughter, used  
Like one chess-piece in plans to seat me back  
Upon my throne. A puppet-master, I  
Did play. My soul? A bit was lost each day.  
The beast, I treated as a man. A grave  
Mistake, indeed, my friend. Respect, I thought  
Should be received, my neck he sought to slice  
Instead. But I am master, he the slave.  
Just punishment, deserves the scurvy knave.  
The men, I saw them and forgave. Forgiveness,  
Now I pray would come before my grave.

VICTOR:

So you subdue the beast and exonerate your enemies? I cannot catch the barest hint of penitence in your voice when his name is on your lips. Why did this beast seek to slay you? By whence did you become his master? These matters are of deep consequence if I am to believe a man whose cheeks flush red so readily.

PROSPERO:

Wilt thou lament in perpetuity,  
A monster, who great harm would do to thee?  
Mope not, your gloom, it bores me to the core.  
The end of mine, is happy in mine eyes,  
Your story, feeble, wretched, to despise.

VICTOR:

I wished only to reach a small peace before I must depart the world of men. I wish you well in seeking yours, if only this encounter could have been with one of greater compassion. It seems that rue is with me until the end.

PROSPERO:

I hate to see a man of such fine speech  
Relinquish that which makes him not a beast.",whomeverwiz,2023-01-18T07:08:12Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,7
10eutgn_8,10eutgn,"If I remember correctly, not only was she 18 when she wrote it, she wrote it as part of a competition with her husband (Percy Shelley) and Lord Byron, both poets and literary giants of their time. I can’t remember if they ever ended up publishing their respective stories, but she obviously won big time, which is awesome.

I love this book so much. I think this is partly because I grew up watching movies like Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein (possibly the funniest movie of all time), in which the Creature is presented unambiguously as slow, dumb, and frightening. In the novel, the Creature is so much more complex; he’s unbelievably clever, strong, and fast. He’s also filled with a lust for revenge that is both terrifying and tragic. Like the fallen angel Lucifer, or an unrequited Adam from the Garden of Eden, his experiences with people shape him into a monster that is far more hideous than what his corporeal form conveys. I find the Creature to be an equally fascinating character, and though I hate what he becomes, I understand him and feel an immense sorrow for him.

Victor is also a fantastic character. He truly embodies the hubris of Icarus, the one who flew too close to the Sun. I also wanted to hate him, but Shelley really does force us to sympathize with him. Maybe force is too strong of a word here, perhaps convinces is better. As he lays on the ship, dying and full of regret, we see that he recognizes what his vanity has wrought upon the world. Shelley displays a mature and nuanced respect for her character as a flawed person, something which helped endear him to me.

I have several Frankenstein quotes written down in my phone:

“Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.”

“But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are forever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.”

A very elegant book, and so packed full of meaning and allegory. I’m happy to hear that you enjoyed it! Dracula by Bram Stoker is pretty good as well, though I felt like it dragged at certain parts. In terms of Gothic horror, I have The Haunting of Hill House and The Castle of Otranto on my “to read” list still.

Frankenstein is definitely tragic, but it’s also true that we can have varying feelings toward our creator, including sympathy.

10eutgn_12,10eutgn,"For me, one of the most fascinating aspects about the novel Frankenstein is the theme about how evil and cruelty are created, and the notion that no one is born to be evil or cruel but become so through the trauma of experiencing cruelty and neglect from society and the people around them. Humans are social animals who require love and kindness to properly grow and develop, and the novel explores what might happen when we are denied that. It’s a very psychological novel. Frankenstein's monster starts out as being innocent, kind, cultivated and very good at heart – but becomes cruel, vindictive and even murderous because of the way others treat him.

In a way, its themes remind me a lot of the themes in Wuthering Heights – which is one of my personal favourite novels. How the traumatic experience of cruelty and evil only gives birth to more cruelty and evil in return, until someone is able to break the chain. And Heathcliff reminds me quite a bit of Frankenstein’s monster, in that he is a misunderstood outsider who is probably not hateful, cruel and vindictive from the start but becomes so through the trauma he experiences as a child and as a youth.",Malthesse,2023-01-18T17:29:13Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,12

I've never had a single shred of sympathy for Victor. He's egotistical and shallow, a horrible parent. Running from his own ""child"" just because of how he looks. As someone who is disabled and deformed (obviously I don't look like the creature but still) I have a lot of sympathy for the creature. Initially, all he wanted, was a friend. He started out so nice, not knowing anything (like a baby) and just wanting a friend. If people weren't so shallow, none of the deaths would have had to happen. Was it still wrong for the creature to murder? Yes. But I understood completely where he was coming from. And Victor also shares the blame for them. If people had just not been shallow and given the creature a chance, none of it would have happened. It was all avoidable and breaks down to ""people are shallow, can't see past someone's looks"" which is very realistic, unfortunately.

If I was so horrified by the thing I had just brought into the world, as a scientist especially, I'd want to follow up. And it's not enough that Justine dies (almost was okay with that since the court held her and seemed pretty set on their verdict) but then he has the opportunity to sit with the monster in a tent and does nothing to end him. Clerval dies and he collapses into a heap, he doesn't even consider Elizabeth's safety on their wedding night and after she's gone he's crying with the women over her body instead of, oh, I don't know, using his rage to hunt down the monster? Even the final chase is unimpressive, the monster's telling him to follow and egging him on, and there's no thought of trying to outthink his own creation or getting the better of him.!<

I get what you’re saying about modern perceptions of Horror though!  I think people tend to pigeon-hole the genre into *needing* gore & other gruesome elements, that give a more physical shock value for the audience.    

And that element has its place, for sure!  But the parts of horror stories that really stick with me personally have always involved more existential dread & heaviness.  After it’s read & done, those are the parts I can’t stop thinking about.

82ne2p_25,82ne2p,"The Sun's point is silly. The students are only new readers--no reason for the Sun to rake them over the coals. 

But for the record, Frankenstein's monster isn't a victim. There's little substantive literary criticism that even tries to make the point. The monster as victim is one of those internet theories, sort of like Ron Paul or ""Harry Potter is actually playing make believe under the stairs the whole time,"" that are fun for people of a certain age but doesn't really make sense. 

People can buy into his self-serving perspective for why he killed a half dozen people but ultimately that's Shelley showing how shitty and self-justifying the monster can be. It's not just a dumb brute who kills. It's a he, a someone with a rich interior life, who kills people for really bad reasons. 

But since most people read it in high school they don't have the sophistication to disagree with a novel's viewpoint, even if its one the author is dying for the reader to disagree with. It's sort of like reading Nabokov's Lolita and going: ""H. H. isn't that bad of a guy! Sure he molests that little girl, but he's actually a victim: just ask him!""

Of course it's fun to argue in the classroom: 'is H.H. actually a bad guy?' To Nabokov, probably not. But to Shelley the answer is definitely yes and you got to simply ignore a lot of book to come to another conclusion.

There's probably also an element of the following: since we don't teach civics teachers smuggle it in by other ways, like English class, where they know the students aren't really reading too closely and there's a desire to teach certain values as coincidentally surrounding great works of literature. So the monster's importance becomes an easy way to shoe horn in some classic civic lessons about how bad prejudice and ignorance is, though there's really little in the book about either of those concepts, which naturally leads to the monster becoming the 'victim' in today's nomenclature. 

I promise the commentators taking the students side: if you re-read the book a little older, a little wiser, a little more well-read the portion of the book that got you tear-jerking in high school about poor Frankenstein's monster is going to come off a lot less convincing and a lot more heavy-handed. It's like reading Wells' the *Time Machine*. First read in high school and it's an pretty good sci-fi thriller. Read it a little later and it's a painfully obvious commentary on capitalism. Similarly, Shelley is showing us how humanity squared is twice as violent, twice as self-serving and half as convincing. 

The whole ending of the book--where the monster burns himself alive at the North Pole--is probably one of the least compelling parts of the book in just how moralizing Shelley was: whatever possibility that Shelley was just 'showing us the facts' is gone and instead we get the author flatly informing us that this monster dude is bad and he realizes how pathetic he is. Like any great Victorian England morality cliche, he has to kill himself because of how much of a victim even he realizes he definitely wasn't. I say this only to point out that while I don't think it works in the book, it at least puts a kibosh on the whole 'the point of the book was that Frankensteins monster was a victim.'

... but since at least '90 there's been a tonne of criticism written about the morale responsibility of the creature with some even suggesting that the original '18 publication was intended to be sympathetic to the creature...

...and even before the edition arguments, one of the two major critical angles taken on the novel is the novel as foil to Milton's Paradise Lost...

...and the fact that most of the prominent criticism in the 20th-21st century has been feminist criticism, which often views the creature as a metaphor for either the working class or an oppressed underclass...

...and the fact that Shelley's biographical information, in combination with the drastic changes between the 1818 and 1832 publications, paint a picture of someone broadly sympathetic to political radicalism - in particular, a plethora of essays contextualize the original publication in the context of the pre-1832 English cadaver laws, and suggest that Shelley was aggressively supportive of the political reforms that became the 1832 Anatomy Act, which is a fairly easy argument to make even based solely on the differences in the prefaces, let alone the descriptions of Victor's education and motivation behind it.

So while it's perfectly fine to say ""My opinion on *Frankenstein* is very simple, free of nuance, and solely an opinion - and that opinion is that the monster was a bad dude,"" it's completely absurd to say that ""there's little substantive literary criticism"" that tries to make the point that the monster isn't a victim. Not only is there a great deal of substantive literary criticism that equates the monster to either an oppressed class, a foil for Milton's Adam, or a metaphor for victims of the Anglican Church's hardline policy against the Anatomy Act, if you sum it all up it seems likely that the *majority* of substantive literary criticism does not take the view that the monster ""isn't a victim.""",xveganrox,2018-03-08T06:22:25Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,46

I don't know that that's true at all, and if anyone's just teaching that without any nuance then they're doing their students a disservice. I teach and work with mostly English undergrads and that certainly isn't true here. 

>Before the 90s was it just radicals who held the belief that the monster was a victim. Or, was it a wildly accepted view of the the novel since it’s inception. 

I used 1990 because that's when the most widely used English reader started to include a preface discussing differences between the first publication and the third publication, and because there was a surge in articles and essays on the first publication's connections to Shelley's political views and the Anatomy Act. All of that was pre-dated by feminist and Marxist criticism of the monster as a class metaphor. Even setting all of that aside (and the connection was made by some people well before 1990), there's criticism going back to 1831 which analyses the monster through the lens of Milton - which pretty implicitly suggests that it's a victim.

All of that is beside the point, though. I'm not arguing that the monster is the ""victim,"" and I don't even think that that's a very meaningful question to ask. I'm just pointing out that the idea of the creature as a ""victim"" as the poster describes it isn't in any way new. 

>From what I remember, Shelley painted Frankenstein with just as much sympathy as the monster. He had more color and attachments with other characters.

As a slightly nerdy side note, you probably read the 1818 version if you thought that Shelley painted Frankenstein as somewhat sympathetic. One of the differences that stands out the most between the first and third publication is Frankenstein's origin story. For example, describing Frankenstein's education, compare 1818 1.2:

>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a visit to some of the principal professors, and among others to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He received me with politeness, and asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I mentioned, it is true, with fear and trembling, the only authors I had ever read upon those subjects. The professor stared: ""Have you,"" he said, ""really spent your time in studying such nonsense?""

to the same section in the 1831 text:

>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a visit to some of the principal professors. **Chance -- or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's door** -- led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. **He was an uncouth man,** but deeply embued in the secrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. **I replied carelessly; and, partly in contempt,** mentioned the names of my alchymists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared: ""Have you,"" he said, ""really spent your time in studying such nonsense?""

It's generally accepted now that the changes to the 1831 edition were made to prepare it for a more anti-science, Anglican audience, in order to secure Shelley's son's financial future. Some of the misunderstandings and miscommunications around it might be because the two editions are 95% similar but frame things in very different ways. Someone who only read the 1831 edition - which was certainly the dominant version until a few decades ago and is still in print - would have a different and probably less sympathetic impression of Frankenstein and his creature than someone who only read the 1818 edition.",xveganrox,2018-03-08T20:07:59Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,54

Though...for a woman she sure wrote some male privilege there. With Victor and his creation both thinking that the female creature is going to want what they automatically assume...that she'd want to spend her life with the male creation. They're treating her like property.

tsy1w5_14,tsy1w5,"I wrote a paper a couple of years ago about Frankenstein thought from the point of view of post-partum depression and child neglect. It gives you a completely different perspective, of a child that has been abandon, pushed away by his own ""father"" who sees him as an ""atrocity"".  

&#x200B;

>""How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?""

&#x200B;

The monster doesn't have a name, taking away its individuality, I think in a way, Frankenstein sees himself in it. He was a child of neglect, who continues that cycle of negligence, when in replacement of his mother he creates a son he abandons, as he felt he was abandoned too.

&#x200B;

>“My mother had much desired to have a daughter”

&#x200B;

It is interesting to see it from that concept, a child which is pure, a white canvas, becomes he is unwanted and treated as such. In Mary Shelley’s book, the monster is seen as a murderer and evil in Victors eyes. All Victor does is play the victim card when he is the main reason of why the monster ended up like that.

&#x200B;

>""I was alone. I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me: and in the bitterness of my heart, I Cursed him.""

&#x200B;

>""There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No. From that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me, and sent me forth to this insupportable misery""

&#x200B;

He even asks for a companion, someone so he is not alone, and this is also negated to him. It all depends on which point of view you take, the one of the scientist who feel haunted by his own creation, or the one of the creation who's never received anything but hate.

Frankenstein's book always brings a quote by Eileen Sendrey to mind:

If someone were to have me choose for them to read between Dracula and Frankenstein, it would be the Modern Prometheus any day of the week. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Dracula is wonderful as well (still in my reading queue). However, the story has been adapted so many times with so many spins and homages, Frankenstein gets left in the dust.

""Ye Shall be As Gods"" is a theme humanity has been dabbling with since before industrialization. The horrors of going beyond the scope of what we are capable of controlling are things we are struggling with today between the climate crises and the ethics of genetic tampering. At what point do we become responsible gods? It also delves into alienation and the feeling of being othered against your will. I'd argue we could possibly project some LGBTQ+ themes onto the story; why give life to someone if you're only going to hunt them down and attempt to destroy them?",avsdhpn,2021-09-20T07:53:44Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,15
prn9pp_16,prn9pp,"I've long been fascinated with reading works from the 19th century. They are overly wordy but to be fair, they were the television/movies/social media of their time and were attuned to that time's longer attention span. If one has the patience to slog through them, insights can be gleaned to commonalities of the human condition that have not changed for hundreds of years. In the case of works like ""Frankenstein,"" we see questions about humanity's grasp on new technology and ""we could, but should we"" proffered. We would do well to look through the literature of our past to find our way forward.",mammakat,2021-09-20T08:13:37Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,16
prn9pp_17,prn9pp,"Frankenstein is absolutely one of my favorite books. It blows my mind that Shelly was only 19 when she wrote it. However, not all classics are the same. I think I read Bram Stoker's Dracula immediately after Frankenstein, hoping that magic would strike twice. Nope, despite the interesting subject matter it was dull and boring. The 90's movie Dracula, staring Keanu Reeves, Winona Rider and Gary Oldman, is one of the few movies that I believe surpasses the book.

When I first started reading the classics, I read some of the ""dirty"" literature, like Fanny Hill and Lady Chatterly's Lover. Both of those are damn boring books. But then I read Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer and I was in love with classics again. These days I try to read a classic every 4-5 books I read. Some are great, some not so much. Some I just can't get through. I could not finish the Divine Comedy (only got through Hell). I recently read Don Quixote by Cervantes and damn was that a slog.

Both of these, and probably a lot of similar works of the time, have a lot more depth than any adaptation has yet managed to convey; this is understandable when that depth depends on a 19th century context, but they have incredible things to say that are worth picking out of the text.

Frankenstein is ultimately the story of an estranged father and son, told through the lens of a science experiment gone wrong. Where there is horror in it, it is mostly the horror of the human condition.",Generalitary,2021-09-20T19:17:28Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,19

The teacher still tried though, got to the point where she just gave us a sub 10 page summary to get some sort of participation out of the class and one dude had the audacity to say “this is too long, can I get a summary of the summary”.

prn9pp_35,prn9pp,"Low key though, a lot of them aren't that good. 

To kill a mong bird, Dorian Grey, brave new world, animal farm, childhoods end, they're all incredible.

Some others are valuable for what they say about human nature despite being a bit of a slog to read like Flowers for Algernon, Moby Dick, slaughter house five, etc. 

But others are dense and just not as timeless as English teachers wish they were. 1984 doesn't connect with Z-oomers because they grew up with the surveillance state and it turns out that it has almost nothing to do with communism or the cold war. The western world accepted it in exchange for security. Maybe that's good, bad, or indifferent. But it does make 1984 unrelatable.

I feel like Frankenstein is in the second category and slipping into the third. The language is foreign enough to modern readers that is difficult to connect. The moral dilemmas debated are now handled by scientific specialists on a daily basis and by legislation which is revised periodically to reflect public opinion. And frankly I don't think people should be tanking life advise from Mary Shelley on top of the rest. I think Frankenstein should be allowed to die.

My go-to example for the latter is Die Leiden des jungen Werther bt Goethe. God, that was **painful** book to slog through. The titular character doesn't do a single thing, everything just kind of happens _to_ him until the very end. It's full of the purplest of prose and feels like it's written in that parody old-fashioned tone (the English equivalent would include a lot of ""Verily"" and ""Forsooth"") that is hard to believe as something people would ever have actually said.

Frankenstein indeed had created a monster, though the monster wasn't born when they were created, quite the contrary; it became a monster through the evils and ignorance learned from Victor and other humans tainting their heart.

sx7h45_19,sx7h45,"My thoughts on this book are honestly just too extensive. It was transformative in my life. I've read it more times than I have kept count of, but ultimately I was always just as interested in Shelley's life and the inspiration behind it. It seems like I'm usually that way with the books I love most. I remember a documentary I watched in the mid 90s about the book's influence on our culture, and honestly, I recorded it on vhs just so I could watch that over and over for years to follow until someone taped over it. 

Now I know that being an author who wrote an alternate telling of the story, my opinions here can easily seem like self promotion, and sometimes I do try that,  because I'd love for people to read and discuss my book. Of course I wouldnt want that to overshadow my comments. I really believe fans of the original would enjoy what I've done weaving together the creature's perspectives with the Shelley family's lives, or entangling that with a new take on Lord Ruthven from ""the Vampyre"", but first and foremost, I'm always going to be a lifetime fan. 

For me, the top list on my favorite reads is always 

1. Frankenstein
2. Hunchback of Notre Dame and Les Miserables
3. Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde
4. Count of Monte Cristo, tied with the Time Machine
5. Tolkiens' ENTIRE middle earth saga

That surprises some people because they assume knowing me, that Tolkien would come first (I am literally trying to remodel my house to look like a hobbit hole interior. I proudly display my tolkien collectibles. I'm planning a hobbit themed wedding, etc)... but when it comes down to it, it's always been Frankenstein first... I get a lot out of my love for Tolkien. I want to live in that world. I do... I want Sam's courage and Frodo's resilience. I want Bilbo's sense of adventure. Its romantic to think about how Tolkien built his world, but Frankenstein was just more personal to me. I felt like the creature growing up. I related to the struggle of his pains and otherness. It's a deeper connection for me abd by extension, I have so much respect for Mary Shelley.

I'm not into the pop culture version of the character and I honestly don't want pictures of Karloff or anything around, but I deeply relate to the story. My sympathies for the creature and how I feel about him, are what led me to become an author. Truly, I can not praise it enough.",Fit-Cover-5872,2024-01-07T19:21:50Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,19

Some have issue with Piers Anthony on his writing style on certain characters, but I thought his first book in the series was best, and Zane was an interesting viewpoint on why Death is as they are, who many deem callous but others call kind.

5nxd6g_2,5nxd6g,"In one way I find Frankenstein comforting. It shows that the mildly depressing loneliness of life isn't a modern thing. That it's something humanity has faced for a long time. The people of the past felt alone, so it's okay that we do as well. Being an outcast isn't a result of technology isolating us from one another, or the media only reporting on the harshness of the world. A student in a university in 1818 could feel alone, and he isn't so different from a student in a university in 2016. Isolation isn't an invention of the 21st century.

In another way it's completely depressing. Because in some fundamental way we haven't changed since 1818. Despite modern science and understanding we are still the same inside. We still face and fail to meet the same expectations and challenges that we did then. Despite instantaneous, global communication and an easily accessed repository of all knowledge many of us are still incredibly alone.",mrbibs350,2017-01-14T19:28:47Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,2
5nxd6g_3,5nxd6g,"I really do like this novel for many of the reasons given here by others. Something no one has yet mentioned is the subtitle; The Modern Prometheus. Shelly didn't invent the phrase; Kant had previously dubbed Benjamin Franklin the ""Prometheus of modern times"" for his electricity experiments. Just as the original Prometheus created man and gave him the ability to survive Victor created the ""new man"" with the ""new fire"", electricity. The story of his crime and punishment in Prometheus Bound (probably Aeschylus) is continued with his release from captivity in Prometheus Unbound written by Mary Shelly's then lover later husband Percy Shelly that was almost certainly in the works when Shelly wrote Frankenstein. The Promethean analogy runs throughout the story. Page one the sailor writes to his sister that he is in ""a country of eternal light where the sun is forever visible"". Victor describes the moment he knew it would work as ""a sudden light so brilliant and wondrous"". The monster's first sensation is ""the light pressed upon his nerves'. It is not until the end that Victor is ""borne away by the waves and lost in darkness"".

5nxd6g_5,5nxd6g,"I have heavily studied this novel as well as the author, Mary Shelley, herself. It absolutely is applicable to this day and age in terms of us having to understand that neither reason nor romanticism can stand alone without the other.

The authors father was a critic of the enlightenment and felt that reason alone couldn't fully provide the need of humanity.

Dr. Frankenstein created the creature, also known as the demon. Frankenstein was not the creation but the creator. Frankenstein galvanized, or brought to life, a being that he immediately abandoned and there were dire consequences for both the creature as well as the scientist.

Not only is it commentary on ethics in science nowadays but it also is a good example of why we need to consider the emotional ramifications of rational or utilitarian acts. 

It also has some very interesting feminist undertones, with him entirely destroying and dismembering the female counterpart. 

And the story behind it's writing is quite interesting. The author, Percy Shelley and Lord Byron were in a ghost story writing competition while they were spending time together at a cabin. The novel was released without an authors name, so most assumed it was her lovers writing because how could an 18-year-old girl have written such a such a controversial novel that because so famous?

The figure of Frankenstein was later used to demonize liberals, because Mary Shelley's father was quite the radical.",,2017-01-14T22:48:08Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,5

5nxd6g_7,5nxd6g,"In my mind this is the chief ingredient that's been lost in every single adaptation of the book. While the theme that science can run amok has been told and retold again and again (I read a fascinating essay in college positing that ""Jurassic Park"" was an update on the Frankenstein myth), this critical theme is nearly always discarded.

My hunch: it's very easy to make a mad scientist the bad guy because he is presented as something ""other"". That is, not many people of Shelley's time were galvanists or even scientists nor are most of us in the present day geneticists. We perceive those who operate outside the realms of what we understand threatening anyway, because frequently they exercise some degree of control over things which are greatly out of our control. But we're less likely to heap such fear upon the act of cruelty or rejection because each of us engages in it at some point.

To condemn Frankenstein for his casual cruelty is to condemn us ourselves. To condemn Frankenstein for toying with the laws of nature is to condemn the ""other"". That's why the latter myth has become integral to retellings of this story and the former is all but ignored.

As Robert Sawyer's agent once told him: there's a lot of money to be made by telling people to be afraid of science.

The consequences can be dire if we do not consider them carefully. In this case science has created a living and conscience being.

I'm not sure how a woman author would be perceived during her time, I believe she was early 1800s? Or if people would have even cared at all. She could definitely be a role model to female activists currently. 

 Although I am not sure of the intention of the book, if it was a social commentary or simply a story. I never like to assume the authors intentions, but the story can be used as a tool to look at the progression of science in current times. Especially dealing with ethics and moral responsibility. 

 If the goal of Mary Shelley was to provide a story to provoke thoughts on morals and ethics, then she was very right. If you look at in that sense, the story itself, in pop culture shows a direct reflection of what Mary Shelley could have been trying to explain. Children stories, movies and TV all show Frankenstein's creation as a horrific monster which seems to be the opposite of what the book is trying to say.

Frankenstein is a powerful commentator toward society, yes, but the level of humanity demonstrated by a supposedly non-human being is the major takeaway. Frankenstein - yes i will refer to him as such; his being created rather than born does not exempt Victor from being his progenitor - is made of human parts. He expresses human emotion. He does not begin to act inhumanly until Victor, his last chance at acceptance, breaks him. Society scorns him, his every attempt at connection is thwarted, and all he asks is for companionship so he will not have to suffer alone. Victor denies him and, in retaliation for the inhumanity shown to him, he responds in kind. Forcing the reader to examine themselves, to realize that little is straightforward and morality does not a good man make makes the story so much more than its era - it's one of the best examples of ""what a good book does"" that has ever graced us.",thebestsamoyed,2017-01-16T01:23:38Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,21

Shelley described Frankenstein's monster as an 8-foot-tall (2.4 m), hideously ugly creation, with translucent yellowish skin pulled so taut over the body that it ""barely disguised the workings of the arteries and muscles underneath""; watery, glowing eyes, flowing black hair, black lips, and prominent white teeth.

The bolt-necked lumbering flat-skulled green ogre of pop culture was invented purely for the sake of looking more intimidating on film.

9o59mk_2,9o59mk,"I think one reason is because so much of the book is internal - the internal experience of Frankenstein and the creature. It's hard to translate that kind of internal experience to the screen, so most adaptations have gone for the cheap thrills (or laughs). 

Besides, popular culture has developed a bunch of Spark Notes-level ideas about this novel - it's about creation, or whatever - when the real thing is much more complex. So the more the novel is adapted, the less it's tied to the source material and the more it's connected to the wider cultural \*idea\* of the source material. I'd bet some of this has to do with when the earliest adaptations onscreen were - before effects and locations, let alone film storytelling, could really handle the full text. I bet if no one had adapted Frankenstein until the 1990s, you'd see a much more faithful, or at least a much less narrow, interpretation of the book.

I'm glad you like it, though. Mary Shelley is fascinating, her parents are fascinating, Percy Shelley is fascinating... The relationship between Frankenstein and science is fascinating... There's so much to delve into with this novel.",,2018-10-14T19:56:46Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,2

Like you, I was thinking how it can be redone but honestly, I think it would be quite difficult to adapt from the book.

9o59mk_57,9o59mk,"Frankenstein is one of my favorite books! The layers of narration are amazing, every now and then you are at a point where you're reading someone's second hand accounts and realize that this is still being told to the sailors sister through letters from a story he heard from Victor. It's like 5th hand accounts. Also, Shelley's original version, and not her husbands hamfisted edit published after, has a lot of interesting themes and views on women at the time. Her husband's edit took out a lot of that to make the women more meek helpless. And the fact that the creature was the victim of the story surprised me, Victor was the narrcisist that brought everyone around him down and abandoned the helpless creature, not even giving him the benifit of a name even when telling the story to the sailor. 

I haven't seen any actual adaptation of the book, I hate that a story this amazing gets brushed off in movies as ""oooh scary monster eat you"", it deserves a real movie.",Wrenigade,2018-10-15T14:14:45Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,57

9o59mk_63,9o59mk,Frankenstein has had both good and faithful adaptations. The most faithful I've seen is a Hallmark miniseries from 2004. The Branagh/DeNiro version that's been mentioned a bunch of times is faithful aside from a twist at the end. There's also a little remembered TV movie from like 1992 with Randy Quaid as the Monster that keeps the story mostly in tact. Beyond that I'd argue the first two Universal  movies and 'The Curse of Frankenstein' (1957) qualify as damn good if not faithful. ,DustyFeedbag,2018-10-15T23:01:02Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,63

They actually add some elements that I think were for verisimilitude, like a plague breaking out in the college-town, but I don't know if making it a period piece services the film in any meaningful way. The way in which they choose to portray the monster's creation is... inexplicable. It's got such vision in the stage design and the performance from Branagh, but it just ends up being incredibly stupid because it tries to make you feel whimsical even though the whole movie has been playing up a dreary mood of dower depressingness.

9biett_26,9biett,"Mary Wollstonecraft lead a tragic life. During the French Revolution she internalized Enlightenment principles like the “libertine lifestyle” aka sexual freedom, from an “oppressive and prude Christian society.” So she followed through and became sexually active. 
She got pregnant and the man left her while the blood was running through the streets of Paris. 
She wrote letters to him saying how much she missed him and how tyrannical men are, etc and then died, alone and the height of her despair. 
Mary Shelley read those letters and after nearly making the same mistake her mother did, when she found out “sexual revolution” was just a trick pulled by men to pump and dump women at their convenience. The women become victims because they forsook the shield of marriage and a stable family, so now they have to raise the kid on their own or get rid of it. “Feminism” was born from the horrors of the “sexual liberation”. This same process happens countless times, like in America during the 60s. 

Just like any other horror novel or film, Frankenstein is ultimately about the consequences of sex and unrestrained passion. The “free love” movement is a lie that destroys the familial structure and brings many negative feelings to everyone involved, like isolation, unloved, etc etc. Tragic lives inspires great works of art.

9biett_63,9biett,"It's certainly not a focused story.

It follows a number of characters over the course of their lives and then right towards the end of the book the element that makes it the last man is introduced.  It feels like an idea they had very late into writing the book and then they decided to title the book after this late introduced plot turn.

Shelley certainly had problems getting beyond Frankenstein as nothing else they did was even close to as successful.

Edit: Frankenstein was a young student at the University of Ingolstadt where Adam Weishaupt was a law professor-

>“You know Frankenstein is believed to have been based in the city because of the Illuminati,” Klarner said enthusiastically as he took me on a short tour of Ingolstadt’s historical and religious landmarks. “By the French Revolution, there were already theories that the revolution began in Ingolstadt and that the Illuminati were the intellectual fathers of the revolution. This is why many literary theorists believe Mary Shelley knew about Ingolstadt, and why Frankenstein was then set here.”

This is what I mean by over analysing. Whilst the larger more prominent example is staring everyone in the face her priority was the bloody colour of the curtains.

The monster in the book has a hostile beginning, facing rejection.

I agree that some pages seem like filler. I think a big part of that is that Shelley wrote it in a different era than we know. Everything goes so fast for us, but 1818 would be much slower, The focus on details (like the Rhine scene you mentioned) would've been interesting for Elizabeth & Viktor, whereas what we're used to would be a video game, or a book, or our phone. Personally, I think maybe we're just not used to the times the book was written in. But I definitely can understand feeling it was unnecessary.

As for the characters, I definitely agree. I empathized with just about every character that was introduced, even the French villagers and the crew of the ship in the Arctic. That's one thing Shelley did really well, is allow the reader to connect with every character. It feels like maybe it was meant to help us connect with the Monster.

y3cp1i_2,y3cp1i,"Frankenstein is very heavy on descriptions and I understand that’s not everybody’s thing but it is a gothic novel. Focus on scenery and atmosphere is a key element of the genre. The descriptions of the Rhine river are particularly important because Mary Shelley got a great deal of her inspiration for Frankenstein from the atmosphere she felt while traveling on the Rhine river. 


Side note, The circumstances that drove Mary Shelley to write Frankenstein are very interesting.

However Viktor only kinda abandoned the monster, he did leave the monster alone in his apartment but the monster went out into the world by himself Viktor never kicked him out. Of course that’s understandable as coming into existence is probably scary and confusing. 


Once Frankenstein is out and about and realizes how difficult living in this world is he doesn’t attempt to go back to Viktor and explain his troubles, he instead goes straight to killing a child. Viktor had sympathy for the monsters story and seemed to have an understanding that he failed to uphold his duties, but he could not get over the rage of his little brothers murder.

ych7y2_12,ych7y2,"He actually learns French lol. But pedantry aside, from scratch is the only way for anyone to learn a language. The Creature admits that he spends months completely ignorant of what the inhabitants are saying but he realised understands the significance of communication between humans. By the time Safie arrives, he only has a very rudimentary knowledge - a few words which he repeats to himself. He then effectively receives language lessons by watching Safie's lessons. His complete mastery of the language is, admittedly, unlikely, since he rarely has cause to practise, even including the 3 rather heavy tomes he finds in the woods (Lives, Paradise Lost and Werter), but children do learn quickly. And I suppose we shouldn't forget that his fluency is related to us as readers through both Frankenstein and then Walton. 

His presence isn't noticed because... he's quiet, I guess? He doesn't crash around, he actively doesn't want to be noticed because of the treatment he first received. And the cottagers are happy to believe that a miracle provides them with firewood each night and clears a path in the snow, rather than an 8-foot tall newborn. 

Regarding how Frankenstein goes about it, he states that he would never reveal it, particularly to someone so driven by a passion for knowledge and scientific discovery like Walton, because he believes now that he was wrong to play God. However, galvanism is an implied method (he turns away from the out-of-date alchemists that shaped his youth when he sees lightning obliterate a tree). The assemblage of the body from stolen body parts is almost outright stated, Frankenstein mentions hanging around graveyards and charnel houses, he says he chose the best, biggest, most beautiful body parts for his creation, he knows that what he has done is so awful and grotesque and that he could never tell anyone, and when he tears apart his second Creature, he has the foresight not to leave human remains in a small hut in the Orkneys.

okms3f_1,okms3f,"The monstrous part of Viktor Frankenstein is attaining the godly power to create life and immediately ditching all responsibility afterwards. He made the monster and left it in the world without guidance or protection it could rightly say he owed it. The Monster's feelings of rage against Frankenstein are those of a suffering mankind against an absent god in a cruel world. Only the Monster has the power and the means to hold his creator accountable. There's also some themes of a power struggle between father and son / creator and creation here (i.e. Chronos eating his children or Oedipus killing his dad).

This constellation is further fueled by the first three books the Monster finds and reads and which heavily form its outlook on the world: Milton's *Paradise Lost* (It's about a somewhat sympathetically described Lucifer rebelling against God and being thrown out of heaven), Goethe's *Sorrows of Young Werther* (A young romantic despares against the state of the world in general and fails to find love as his only potential remedy, so he eventually commits suicide - heavy on the *Weltschmerz* and ""existence is suffering"") and Plutarch's *Parallel Lives* (I'm not familiar with that one).

okms3f_2,okms3f,"It's been a long time since I've read the book, but I'll explain the argument as best as I can.

Dr. Frankenstein essentially has the ambition of reanimating a human being without having any concern for the responsibilities that are inherent in the task.  He is so single-mindedly devoted to this goal (which one begins to realize is driven by his own vanity and ego rather than as a noble cause to further mankind) that he seriously deprives himself of sleep and then decides it would be a good idea to bring his creation to life while in this state.  He then panics at the sight of his own creation and runs away.  The first thing that Frankenstein's monster sees is the sight of his own father screaming at his existence.

The monster is a bit of an odd person, being both exceptionally intelligent and eloquent but also with the mentality and severe lack of discipline inherent of a child.  And much like a child, he has an inherent and extreme desire for affection, which is why he became so instantly enamored with the De Lacey family.  Remember that Frankenstein's monster has no fucking clue was is going on.  He literally is birthed in the middle of nowhere, a man screams at the sight of him, and he has no clue what to do, where to go, or what anything in the world is about.  He maintains the intellectual capacity of whatever brain was transferred to him, but no memory of any previous life.

The fact that he was so large and (presumably) hideous drove the De Lacey family to run from him despite him acting as friendly as possible.  Not only that, but they were \*so afraid\* at the mere sight of him that they fled their own home, possibly permanently.  If this didn't drive home that he would forever be denied the affection he so possibly craved, I don't know what would.  Dr. Frankenstein, through his moral failings, had trapped his creation in a living hell literally from birth.

So, naturally, Frankenstein is pissed, so when he comes across William and hears his last name, he flies into a rage, or what might be better described as a temper tantrum a young child would have.  Except that Frankenstein's monster is nearly 7 feet tall and swole as fuck and he's shaking a child as violently as he can.  It's not surprising that the child dies, although it is doubtful that murder was ever the creation's intent.  Imagine that if, every time you got angry during your terrible twos, somebody died a horrible and violent death, and that you \*also\* had the mental capacity to understand the implications of what you had just done.  Dr. Frankenstein, in making the creature so gigantic and failing to imbue him with either discipline or temperance, made it so that his creation could never have a proper outlet for his rage without harming an innocent, further cementing his living hell.

And the thing is, when Dr. Frankenstein *finally* comes back to meet his creation (and let's note that it took the death of a relative to drag his ass back to his son), Frankenstein's creation does not strike him in rage like he did William, demonstrating that he has clearly been affected by the consequences of his actions and is capable of empathy and introspection.  Instead, he begs Dr. Frankenstein to make him a wife so that he can have somebody to love, and promises to stay far away from people so that he can never hurt anybody ever again.

Dr. Frankenstein agrees to this, gets mostly done building her, changes his mind, and -- without consulting his creation or respecting him at all -- tears her limb from limb in front of his creation's eyes.  He literally tears apart any hopes that his creation has of happiness.  Like literally, physically tears them apart.  He then proceeds to abandon his broken-hearted, enraged, 7 foot tall creation to go fuck and marry his lover, showing no remorse, empathy, affection, or care for the welfare of anybody else in the area.  For all he knows, his creation could fly into a murderous rage and kill everybody in sight.  He gives zero shits, as long as he doesn't have to take responsibility or culpability for his actions and he can go and get his dick wet hundreds of miles away.

But Frankenstein's creation has grown wiser and more tempered since his birth, and he decides to punish his creator by forcing him to suffer in the exact same way that his creator made him suffer.  Just as Dr. Frankenstein had torn apart his wife *just before* he could spend the rest of his life with her in happiness and joy, his creation -- specifically on his wedding night -- tears apart his wife in front of Dr. Frankenstein's eyes.  It is a brutal act, and possibly also the first time in Dr. Frankenstein's life that he faced the consequences of his actions.

The punishment is even more layered, though.  The creation intentionally stays just far enough ahead of Dr. Frankenstein to keep him chasing him, choking on his rage until he finally succumbs to the experience and dies, perfectly mirroring what Dr. Frankenstein had done to his creation.  Frankenstein's monster lives in eternal, Doom-guy style rage at the loss of his wife and his mistreatment, a suffering that would only be ended with his death.

And Frankenstein's creation, even after doling out this punishment to his creator, is found weeping on Dr. Frankenstein's corpse, for all he ever wanted was the love of his father, but his father -- the true monster -- was incapable of such an emotion.  Convinced that nobody on Earth would ever see past his monsterous form, with no wife to love, and no father to guide him, he aims to die in a frozen wasteland, a physical metaphor for the lack of compassion that the world had shown him.",WolffUmbra,2021-07-15T07:54:55Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,2
okms3f_3,okms3f,"I think the whole issue of the word monster may be throwing people off a bit. The novel doesn't actually ever call anyone a monster. It most often refers to Victor's creation as a ""creature."" Pointing out who and what is a monster is not really the underlying point.

I think you're right. Victor is flawed in ways that a lot of human beings are flawed. I actually think that's central to what the novel is saying.

Remember the second part of the title as it was originally printed: Frankenstein, Or the Modern Prometheus. Prometheus, as the story of the God who stole fire from the heavens to give to humans, is usually told nowadays as a positive thing. Fire is arguable man's first technological achievement. It gives us light, cooks our food, keeps us warm in the winter.

But think of the negative things that we also have used fires for. Burning people alive. Razing whole cities. Slashing down rainforests. Perhaps Zeus was right to be mad at the arrogant and naïve Prometheus for what he did.

And fires aren't even always used for outright destruction. Think of the ""gender reveal"" parties that accidentally started huge wildfires in the American west. Those terrible results are just from irresponsible use of fire.

Frankenstein is the Modern Prometheus because he is stealing power from the gods/God that mankind was never meant to have. The power to create sentient life. Unfortunately, mankind, unlike God, is imperfect. Not evil. Not monstrous. Just flawed. But even our ordinary run-of-the-mill flaws can lead to terrible consequences when combined with great power, no matter our initial intentions. In the case of Frankenstein, his ambition, unreliability, and inability to take ownership for his actions aren't all the uncommon. Most of the time, nothing terrible would result from these flaws. But when you combine them with the power to create life, it leads to his death and the death of most of those he loves.",ryes13,2021-07-15T12:40:12Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,3

okms3f_7,okms3f,"The creature is the real monster, and that’s a hill I’m ready to die on. I was shocked when I finally read this book last year: I kept waiting for Frankenstein to do something messed up, or to hear what convoluted justification the creature had for murdering a child. But no! Victor was guilty of fleeing from a shambling inhuman thing, and the creature became a serial killer because people treated him bad. 

Could Frankenstein have assumed more responsibility? Yes. He acts pretty irresponsibly and downright cowardly, ditching years of work in a moment and not returning to check on things for ages. He’s one of these melodramatic Victorian characters who seems super irrational to modern ol’ me. But in his defense, he had no way of knowing what he had created, if it had feelings, even if it was going to survive for more than a few hours. It’s not like he saw this creation as a literal child and turned his back. He might have tried harder to work this question out, but I think the case of him being an absent father is overreaching. If anything his duty was to hunt and kill his creation to protect the public against an unknown element. The hubris angle would work better had he failed at what he was trying to do. I can totally accept that people will have different impressions of his culpability, and some will condemn him. I get that. But he is a Boy Scout compared to the creature. 

The creature is vengeful and cruel. He got dealt a bad hand, but he seems to have developed mental and moral faculties very quickly, and nearly as quickly decides his feelings and whims are more important than innocent people’s lives. He murders a kid to send a message. He lets an innocent woman die for his crime, he kills others just to terrorize Frankenstein. That’s cartoonishly monstrous. If the creature deserves our sympathy than so do school shooters. I’ll pass. 

As with all the classics, the population that pretends to know the book is dozens of times larger than the population that actually reads it. Saying that Victor is the real monster is just another piece of folklore that gets passes around which someone can use to appear smart. The absurd part is that probably 100% of people who haven’t read the book would be familiar with the idea that the monster is just misunderstood, so there is nothing novel with parroting that contrarian cleverness.

Not quite the same though.

He didn't kill Laius due to some struggle but because it was fated. Both he and Laius were doomed to play their roles and they did. He didn't know he was killing his father at the time and in fact thought he was saving his father. He just didn't know that the man he thought of as father was not that and that the guy he killed was just that. 

I don't disagree on the Kronos motif, but Oedipus is not a good fit for Frankenstein because it's so steeped in Greek ideas about fate, hubris and prophecy.",BoredDanishGuy,2021-07-15T16:56:24Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,14

When he woke up, the creature was gone. When the creature met him again, Frankenstein was terrified and was afraid of creating another monster like him. It didn’t help that the creature was beginning to threaten him and killed his loved ones.

This doesn't *excuse* his actions in any way, but I do believe it creates a great deal of sympathy for the Creature's actions.  He is a baby who's father fled at the sight of him, along with basically every other living person that ever met him.

Frankenstein himself, on the other hand, *has* a full life's experience.  He has the capacity and experience to reason out what the consequences of leaving an 8 foot tall monster free to run amok will be and he does so anyways.  Later when he meets the monster again he had the choice to atone and once again chose the outcome he knew would result in more death and then disregards his own actions and acts as if there will be no consequences.

Think of it this way, imagine the bible's garden of Eden story, except god creates Adam and immediately leaves the story before even presenting him with the choice of taking the knowledge of good and evil, he's a crude mockery of his creator instead of a handsome likeness, and instead of a beautiful garden he's abandoned in a strange cold place and has to flee into the forests alone and fend for himself.

My take is that The Creature was created good, or at least with great potential for good, he's intelligent, strong, capable of sympathy, kindness, etc, and is repeatedly driven further from humanity by tragedy.

Most scholars would say it's the wrong question to ask essentially.

It distracts from far more interesting and fruitful questions about Percy and Mary's collaborative relationship and the impact they had on one another as artists.

They planned to spend the summer with the poet Lord Byron, whose recent affair with Claire had left her pregnant.[53] The party arrived at Geneva on 14 May 1816, where Mary called herself ""Mrs Shelley"". Byron joined them on 25 May, with his young physician, John William Polidori, [NB: Author the first modern vampire story]

>""It proved a wet, ungenial summer"", Mary Shelley remembered in 1831, ""and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house"".[57][note 5] Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves with German ghost stories, which prompted Byron to propose that they ""each write a ghost story"".[58][59] Unable to think of a story, young Mary Godwin became anxious: ""Have you thought of a story? I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative.""[60] During one mid-June evening, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. ""Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated"", Mary noted, ""galvanism had given token of such things"".[61] It was after midnight before they retired, and unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her ""waking dream"", her ghost story:[62]

You have a bunch of young people, all with emotional and relationship baggage, spending a summer beside a lake in an isolated mansion telling ghost stories and trying to scare each other. One of the youngest of the group can't figure out any story to tell the others... until she has a waking nightmare in the middle of the night that inspires her to tell the scariest ghost story of all.

81ca11_28,81ca11,"The monster was human. Our society likes to construct the notion of “human” as something good, pure and noble (it’s even turned into an adjective, “humane/inhumane”), but the truth is that there have been plenty of humans who have done a lot worse than this creature. Humans have inherent capacity for cruelty, abd intelligence doesn’t reduce it, on the contrary, some of the worst serial killers or cruel dictators like Hitler were also highly intelligent. But we also have inherent capacity for love. If you look at the most violent criminals, most of them had bad childhoods, they were often abused as children (which, studies show, is one of the best predictors of future criminal activity). The creature didn’t start out as evil, all he wanted was companionship. But he was abandoned by his creator, later shunned and rejected by him openly, and every human he’s met treated him the same way. All he asked was to be given a mate, a companion who’s like him, but Frankenstein denied him that. It was only expected that he would turn out like that. And most of his cruelty wasn’t random, he specifically targeted his creator, wanted to ruin his life as a revenge. Revenge too is a very human notion.

I think the point to make us question this distinction between “human” and “monster”. Humans can behave monstrously. “Monsters” can behave like humans. In a way, the monster was part of Frankenstein, his dark side that he rejected and tried to run away from. If he cared for his creation, nurtured him, raised him with love, he wouldn’t have become like this. It’s just like our own nature, it’s what we make of it.

As for the last name though, I think it makes sense to call him Frankenstein. You bring up a good point about Victor casting him out for his physical appearance and the symbolic meaning of no last name. But every chance the zombie (who I will call Adam for brevity) gets, he constantly returns to his creator. He is cast aside by his own creator, but still wishes to return to the grace of humanity.

lefgpi_3,lefgpi,">I’m not going to lie, this was a hard read. Not because I couldn’t understand it, it’s because it’s in what I like to call “old English”... words that are long forgotten or sentence structures that we don’t use anymore.

Just to throw this out there, the 19th century vernacular in *Frankenstein* may seem a bit archaic at times, but it's definitely still Modern English.  Actual ""Old English"" (also known as Anglo-Saxon) was brought to Britain in the 5th century and gradually began to die out after the Norman Conquest (1066), when it was replaced among the ruling classes by Old Norman French.  It's the language of *Beowulf*, and it's totally unreadable to present-day English speakers.

The influences of Old Norman French (by the Normans, of course), Latin (by the Romans), and Old Norse (by the Vikings) slowly transformed Old English into Middle English, which *can* be difficult but is definitely readable.  Well-known 15th century works like *Canterbury Tales* and *Le Morte d'Arthur* were both written in Middle English, if you want to check them out.  But this was before spelling rules were standardized, so it helps to read them out loud.

Early-Modern English (or ""Elizabethan English"") had developed by the late-16th century, and it was most famously used in the works of William Shakespeare and in the King James Bible.  The first authoritative and full-featured English dictionary was published in the mid-18th century, which could arguably be considered the birth of Late-Modern English.  And then in the centuries that followed, British imperialism spread English all around the world.

He has no emotional bond with his creation- he’s a parent but doesn’t act like one and never even thought about having to care for or guide the being once it came to life. He virtually abandons his own family while absorbed in his project, barely even writing to his father, and he fucks up all their lives in pursuit of his egotistical goals.

lefgpi_24,lefgpi,"So I know I'm gonna get some details wrong, but way back in the olden days when things were filmed in black and white, makeup didn't care about what actual color was used so long as it translated well into Black and White. What resulted is that a lot of green makeup was used in things to give sort of an unusual shade to faces. Again, I strongly encourage you to look this up, because this is second- (and now third-)hand hearsay. Basically green was used as B&W makeup and then they kept that practice up during color filming which created stereotypical Frankenstein's Monsters and Wicked Witches in color.

Also also, I hear (again, secondhand) that the original movie created around Frankenstein was a veeerrry old film. Like, film as a medium was still new. So the movie is listed as 71 minutes, which by today's standards is short. A lot of plot was cut from the movie, and I'm going to assume that a lot of the draw was from the horror of creating a creature and the film didn't focus so much on Dr Frankenstein's Bad Dad enactment. So it's an early example of the movie butchering the source material to appeal to audiences.

Which also delves into reader’s response theory because it was her reading of Paradise Lost, that casts Satan as a tragic hero betrayed, provoked, and cast out by his father - which is certainly his perspective in the novel (also expressed quite well by the angels in Dogma). 

This is why the creature says “Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”

Shelly casts Frankenstein as Milton’s God - her reading of him - the Father Figure of revealed (biblical) religion, and his creation as the victim of an arbitrary and neglectful creator. She makes a similar point about religion to Euripides- if we overly personify our God (or gods) in such human terms, their actions, in human terms, become horrific.",Katharinemaddison,2023-12-29T11:01:07Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,2

s963jk_2,s963jk,"In high school, when I read Frankenstein, I hated it. Victor seemed like he was unable to change his path and future. He was unable to escape Fate which dictated all his actions. I hated him and it felt like a weird ye olde excuse that Fate and the Angel of Death were to blame for Victor being a dick. It also felt less epistolary compared to Dracula and other novels of that style.

Then I took a gothic lit class in college and we read the 1818 version (Mary's original) and the revised 1831 edition. 
Turns out, I had read the 1831 edition previously -- which Mary Shelley revised to make it less radical, removing a quote from Paradise Lost and other symbolism throughout, and making it more clear that Victor Frankenstein is a puppet to outside forces. It also expands some other areas greatly, such as a single sentence in Chapter 1 about Caroline turning into a multiple page reflection on childhood. Several passages from the Creatures perspective are edited out. Victor is made out to be more sympathetic.

The 1818 version, on the other hand, clearly underscores that all the decisions Victor made were his own. He has significant freewill and can choose to deviate his course but does not. On one hand, this makes him frustrating, but also more believable as a character. Victor is a shitty person and we, the audience, understand this and he is slightly more aware of this fact -- making him, in my opinion, more tolerable. In this version, the Creature is more sympathetic. I also found the 1818 edition to be more believable as an epistolary work, more to the point, and more capital-R Romantic than the 1831 edition. 

Here's a summary of the changes:
https://edwardfjames.com/teaching/frankenstein-1818-and-1831/

Worth noting, as well, that the 1831 version was the most successful in a cultural level and the one from which most adaptations are based off of.

He's often criticized for being a douchebag and not accepting responsibility for the consequences he created, but I find that while his irresponsibility is inexcusable, it is understandable (even relatable for some) and not motivated by any fundamental moral fault. His motive is self-centered, sure, but his actions are a reflection of his inability to escape the logical hierarchy that he has built for himself (the Ti-Si loop). His life is basically a constant confirmation that his ideals are part of reality rather than an active effort to ignore them. He basically is surrounded by very obvious signs of his wrongdoings, and yet I feel that he is so overwhelmed by grief, pain, and incapacity to accept anything outside the strict logical hierarchy he has built for himself (this idealism is also something that the Creature suffers to, but he learns to change). These feelings are an integral part of the human experience, though it is the ""dark side"" of it. I guess where I'm trying to get at is instead of seeing the black-and-white scenario of characters like Frankenstein, we should try to understand why they behave a certain way and help these people out of their isolation rather than further isolating them.",Ok-Thanks1018,2023-01-28T16:22:34Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,6
s963jk_7,s963jk,"As a science person, I cannot understand Victor Frankenstein at all. Invention is rarely an invention. Any breakthrough builds on ideas of previous ideas, theories of previous theories. Never matter how smart you are, you can never do it by yourself. Even AI started decades ago and only when it became generative that it was acknowledged and sudden people perceive as if it were born yesterday. I'd rather Victor to be a witch using magic to bring life to the corpse than in the name of science! 

Mary Shelley wrote the novel when she was a young girl so it is not surprising how her idea of genius and invention is so far from reality. But reality apart, the book is insufferably romantic with sensitive Victor and all his tragedies - not once he would confide it to his friends or family, and the monster who wanted nothing but a companion (why just give him a dog). If the monster has better IQ, can it just think of something better to do?

He was very articulate, intelligent, and while strong like usually portrayed, he was also very quick and agile. Making him far more of an adversary to Frankenstein than the slow, stiff, brutish creature I thought he would be. Frankenstein had far more to fear than the wrath of some towns folk or the monster himself. Like loosing his loved ones and feared dooming others by making the monster a bride.

mzcnem_4,mzcnem,"Despite the lifetimes we've spent reading *Frankenstein* as a society, the book will always have so much to say about everything.

Each time I read a review or analysis, there is always a new and cogent interpretation that adds to our collective understanding. It's a text that keeps giving. (In one of my introductory English courses in college, my professor armed us with several lenses with which to read the novel — one of them was the relationship between Victor and his creature as a homoerotic one. In another audio-analysis on Spotify, a professor noticed a relationship between oppressed people and the creature, being forced into hiding from an ignorant population and denied basic dignities. These discussions will likely continue until the end of literature itself.)

(Also edit: the well-known anecdote that the descriptions of the creature were eerily similar to Shelley's journaled description of her stillborn baby.)

(Also edit edit: The director of the original *Frankenstein* films was [James Whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Whale), who was openly gay throughout his entire career.

After reading the original novel I followed it up with Frankenstein Unbound by Brian Aldiss, which I consider my favorite book (shared with Flowers for Algernon).

mzcnem_10,mzcnem,"The book is awesome, especially given the context of how/when it was written.  The original adaptations came along when monster movies - and movies in general - were getting hugely popular and lost a lot of complex characterization for the sake of thrills/drama/scares.  I'm not judging, it was just the times.

If you get a chance, read some of the ""monster"" books from the 19th century that were ultimately turned into movies in the mid-20th century (e,g. The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, Dracula, etc.) There were a lot of things lost in translation between book and film.  I guess it's not really different today.  ""The Turn of the Screw"" was faithfully adapted in the 20th century a few times, but I always found that one boring.

In ""Frankenstein's"" case, what was really lost was that they turned the ""monster"" from an embittered, suffering, lamenting, tortured soul into a confused, lumbering, child-like monster.  And they change Dr. Frankenstein from an unempathetic, egomaniacal a-hole with a god complex into a misunderstood scientist who struggles to manage his resurrected man-child.

I think the best movie adaptation was the one from the early 1990s with Robert DeNiro and Kenneth Branaugh, though the cast was wrong.  It was pretty loyal to the book in spirit and complexity of character.  Alternatively, the ""Frankenstein's monster"" character in the ""Penny Dreadful"" series is a pretty nice adaptation as a character....the series itself, not so much, of course.",ZebrahCadebrah,2021-04-27T09:07:22Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,10

But I would argue that  Kaczynski 's thesis is a bit different from the Icarus-like mythology of Frankenstein. Shelley probably meant to make a point about hubris more so than technology, per se. Shelley's thesis is personal and psychological.  Kaczynski was making a more general argument about technology and its social and political implications.

Another way of looking at it is that  Kaczynski's thesis is only true if one accepts the premise that political freedom is valuable. So,  Kaczynski's thesis is only going to resonate in certain cultures. But Shelley's thesis, being more psychological in nature, is likely true in every culture, all the time.",Rhueh,2020-10-25T16:55:07Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,6
jhkx2s_7,jhkx2s,"EDIT: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/the-strange-and-twisted-life-of-frankenstein

Shelley was pretty hooked up on technology, she drank her own kool-aid and believed lots of quacks saying they had actually reanimated a cadaver using the ideas from her book.

I'd say she didn't think the allegories in that book from beginning to end, and wasn't worried with revolutions (industrial, social, technological, French or otherwise) as much as she was worried with personal choices of individual scientists.

On the other hand, The Unabomber Manifesto has deeper roots that it shows. Kaczynski was a reader of critics of the industrial revolution that were also critics of gender roles and labor specialization (industry requires specialists, specialization creates and reinforce social roles, social roles based on gender create violence). Before going bombing, he broke relations with these people. He admitted being very confused at the time with how his own gender (and possible sex change) and specialized work (educated scientist) fit the criticism of industry, broke up with the theorists and went kabooming stuff as an outlet to his frustration.

Pynchon draws parallels between the craze for Gothic fiction (where I first heard the above) and the raise of the machines in ""Is it OK to be a Luddite?"" Recommend for all to [read](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/18/reviews/pynchon-luddite.html?):

>If there were such a genre as the Luddite novel, this one, warning of what can happen when technology, and those who practice it, get out of hand, would be the first and among the best. Victor Frankenstein's creature also, surely, qualifies as a major literary Badass. ''I resolved . . .,'' Victor tells us, ''to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large,'' which takes care of Big. The story of how he got to be so Bad is the heart of the novel, sheltered innermost: told to Victor in the first person by the creature himself, then nested inside of Victor's own narrative, which is nested in its turn in the letters of the arctic explorer Robert Walton. However much of ''Frankenstein's'' longevity is owing to the undersung genius James Whale, who translated it to film, it remains today more than well worth reading, for all the reasons we read novels, as well as for the much more limited question of its Luddite value: that is, for its attempt, through literary means which are nocturnal and deal in disguise, to *deny the machine.*

You also see it in real world movements as people who, rightly or wrongly, fear genetically modified foods, human-driven climate change, nuclear energy, or a whole host of medical procedures (I am in no way trying to say that all of these fears are equal).

While her husband and the people she hung out with were Romanticists in a strict sense, I'm not sure the same can be said for Mary Shelley. For me, a lot of what Frankenstein is about is how the failure to take responsibility can ruin your life. Victor created the Creature, but failed to show it love, or anything besides cruelty. Therefore, his creation destroyed him. Before writing Frankenstein, Mary lost a child, and her husband was constantly running around sleeping with other people, and failed to help her through that difficult time. Mary may have felt that the miscarriage she had was her version of a monster. She was also trapped in a loveless marriage, and while it gave her freedom, it also ostracized her from participating in society back home. In a way, Percy Shelley's lack of desire to help her after the miscarriage could be seen as irresponsible. Mary eloping with a famous poet could have also been viewed as irresponsible. And while I think she wouldnt have wrote Frankenstein if her life had been different, I do think it's more about how it's important to hold to our responsibilities to provide love and care for each other.",s0rdiid,2020-10-25T21:42:53Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,20

As far as I remember, nothing else regarding Frankenstein's research and scientific discovery is even slightly relevant to the book. And while the creation of the monster as a consequence of that is very far from meaningless, I don't think that it was particularly thematically fitting with much else from the book.

I think the closest you can get  to a major theme that relates to the myth is ""responsibility for what you create"", but that's barely even a theme in the myth of Prometheus itself, and somewhat more broadly applicable as used in Frankenstein. Ultimately, the same relationship could have happened through the monster character being a literal son of Victor, and the book would have been basically thematically identical.",TheDubiousSalmon,2020-10-25T06:16:27Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,25

To read Frankenstein as a Luddite sermon is to diminish the emotional themes of   the work. If all the book is saying is ""technology bad"", then all the interpersonal relationships (and the trauma caused by a lack thereof) are meaningless window dressing. It discounts the role that humanity's inhumanity to man and willingness to ostracize the ""other"" plays in the ultimate downfall of both creator and created.

Well, none of the deaths in the book would've happened if the younger members of the DeLacey family hadn't jumped to conclusions based on the creature's appearance.

4ldsx0_1,4ldsx0,"I think most people tend to read the novel and stop analyzing past ""SCIENCE BAD, NO PLAY GOD."" But that is a shallow reading that doesn't come close to approaching some of the best themes of the novel. 

In my mind, Frankenstein does two things that qualify as monstrous. 

1. He suffers a bizarre and unnatural attachment to his mother. I think the incestual and oedipal themes are apparent throughout the first few chapters of the book. He calls his future wife his ""more than sister"". She's all at once a cousin, sister, and wife. That's odd even for the time period. It's also the death of his mother that drives him toward the breaking point. 

2. He is profoundly self centered in a way that makes him seem completely inhuman. During the trial of Justine he says, ""The tortures of the accused did not equal mine.""

 This poor girl is being put on trial for a murder she didn't commit and is in-fact less guilty in its occurring than he is, yet he believes his ""suffering"" to be more than hers? He cannot get past his own ego to experience empathy. 

He is a monster not because he commits actions that a monster would, but because he consistently acts in a way that a human should not. ",,2016-05-28T02:32:26Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1

Those are two seriously ethically flawed approaches to the creation of life, let alone not telling anybody about it. Because Frankenstein is the narrator, we experience the story through his self-pitying tone, which paints the monster in worse light than we might if he was the protagonist (which he kind of is in part of the narration and he is more sympathetic here). The monster ultimately resorts to evil, but the question as to who is ultimately responsible points mostly to Frankenstein. The ethical questions the book raises in these veins is what makes the book a classic, but Frankenstein is definitely less thoughtful about his actions than the 'monster.'",ohfuckimdrunk,2016-05-28T07:10:10Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,3
4ldsx0_4,4ldsx0,"As someone studying Frankenstein at College, I may be able to help here. Monster is a bit of an overstatement but I think Shelley definitely wanted us to sympathise more with the monster, similar to Milton and Satan in Paradise Lost. Personally, the main reason I believe Frankenstein is portrayed so negatively is because of Shelley's femenist views. He disregarded Elizabeth, destroyed the female monster and abandoned the creature, who is often considered symbolic of women as a whole. Because of this, he had to suffer and be shown negatively. This said, it's a fairly morally ambiguous novel. When you consider the use of frame narratives, it ties the three main characters together so there isn't that much difference between Frankenstein and the creature after all",whenter,2016-05-28T09:23:45Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,4
4ldsx0_5,4ldsx0,"Ok, so there are two ways Mary Shelley defines morality in the novel. Victor Frankenstein is punished, but is it for bad science or bad faith? Does he play God or does he not take responsibility for his experiments? Both are plausible and can be argued thoroughly. Victor creates life, something reserved only for God, and by tampering with morality, he creates a malicious creature. BUT when he first created it, he couldn't stand the uncanny horror of it, so he ignored it. FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. Imagine not caring for your baby after you've given birth to it. How does that affect the child as it grows on its own? Look up Feral Children for some examples. If Victor were a good scientist, he would have taken responsibility for his creation from the beginning and raised it to be better, but since he didn't, the creature's actions are partially Victor's fault. This is what makes him a monster.

There is a third definition of morality in the novel that most people miss. The creature refers to Victor as his ""Author"" on at least two occasions. The creature, in this manner, is an allegory for the Novel, and Victor is the author. Mary Shelley first wrote the novel to scare her freinds, who were authors, so it's plausible that she continued that motif in Frankenstein. The creature roaming the world is not too different than when one releases a novel. It meanders, forever changing the lives of those it touches. For better, or for worse. It becomes its own entity outside the author's control. People interpret and ignore and reimagine without the author's presence too correct them.

4ldsx0_7,4ldsx0,"I think the reason why the monster turns out to be a fiasco is because of the way Victor Frankenstein reacts to him as he comes to life. He shows an unmasked disgust towards him which causes him to feel indignation and after Victor flees, these feelings get bolstered into a deep sense of abandonment and alienation. The underpinnings here could be that if one chooses to bestow 'life' upon an entity, be it an artificially created body or a child or a piece of intelligent technology, one must also have immense respect for that life itself because the entity, once independent, has the ability to think and evolve layers of consciousness. A creator being malevolent or apathetic towards his creation could be potentially dangerous. If Victor Frankenstein was forthright enough to sense the danger that the monster could bring about he should have diligently applied his science to also put a prompt and respectful end to his life instead of running away. Victor Frankenstein could have been a scientist extraordinaire but he lacked a sound system of ethics and he failed to think on his feet in the midst of a crisis.

But I'm with you on this, for the most part.  Frankenstein's only sin was failing to take responsibility for his creation.  I won't even fault him for building it in the first place, because that's how we scientists operate.

As another poster mentioned, Mary Shelley lost her mother. Keep in mind though, that Mary Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft (who was an accomplished writer herself, see *A Vindication of the Rights of Women*) died in childbirth; Mary Shelley didn't just lose her mother, but was actively (though unintentionally) responsible for her death. 

Her father, William Godwin, cast her off and remarried, perhaps blaming Mary for the death of her mother, perhaps never truly forgiving her, perhaps never truly forgiving himself for his part in her loss. Mary *was* a creation who was capable of ""destruction"" (although we know the death of her mother wasn't truly her fault) and rejected by her creator. Godwin rejected his creation, even as she was only learning how to be a human being. She/the creature is a victim of circumstance.

It does when the ignorance is not of a moral nature. Give a very primitive native a loaded and unsafed gun, and he shoots his own child because he is ignorant of its use. This is a monstrous result, sure, but the native is not a monster. In effect, the giver is kind of the monster here because of the nature of the gift.

Instead though, educate that native just enough beforehand in a way that convinces him that the thing is very dangerous and could very likely kill someone if played with. But don't teach him how to actually use it. Despite that, he fools around with it and kills his kid anyway with better knowledge of possible outcomes. Now he's the monster because his ignorance was only about mechanics and he had awareness of potential outcomes. 

In Frankenstein's case, I don't recall that he did anything like a 'what if I do this' analysis. It was all about the act, not about the results, and since those results were expected to create an intelligent being, not thinking it through was a lapse of a moral nature.

hpwhxb_1,hpwhxb,"Hi! I think it's not so much that the creature is innocent, but there are two common misconceptions about the novel: first, that the creature is named Frankenstein (he's clearly not); second, that Frankenstein is a victim (he's clearly not). 

There are different types of readings you can make of the novel, but the way we interpreted it in class last semester was: 

1. Victor is always blaming others over his responsibility. He says that if his dad had taught him better, he wouldn't have been interested in the science of the guys that actually led to his experiments. He blames the creature for being horrible (and thus rejects him), when he is the one who made him. 
2. He does not save Justine. He suspects that the creature was guilty of the murder of his brother, and he can easily explain something to that end (at least to Justine, to appease her of her guilt), but he remains mum. Not only is he condemning her to death (just because he assumes the jury will find her innocent), but he also lets her die with her believen herself to be guilty. 
3. Victor creates the creature without giving second thought to what he is doing. His megalomania gets the best of him as he thinks he is above Man and above God, and believes himself to be a source of life. Yet he does not concern himself over the looks of the creature (not that he should be aiming to make someone like Chris Hemsworth, but, you know, at least not someone hideous). And the second the creature is created, Victor shuns it and rejects it. 

The creature, highly intelligent and capable of acquiring knowledge as he is, is tormented by his looks - no one who sees him will ever accept him due to the hidesousness that he was born to. This leads to constant rejection, violence and solitude. I'm not justifying the creature's murders, because he's conscious of what he's doing to Victor's brother and to Elizabeth, but at first, when he is unaware of what he is doing (like the little girl drowning), it's an accident. 

And then there's Elizabeth. Victor is so self-centered that he doesn't contemplate the possibility of sharing the truth with the woman who's supposed to be his partner, and his narcissism and selfishness lead to her death. If he had told her the truth, they could have sought some form of help or she would have been at least aware so as to try to avoid the creature. 

So, overall, I think the issue is that the creature becomes violent and a murderer because of the way in which he is created and due to the rejection of society upon him, based entirely on his physical appearance, yet Victor is the bigger a-hole if you will, because he never considers the consequences of his actions, he never considers coming clean to his peers (or he does at once but thinks that he won't be believed so he shrugs off the idea), alerting the police, letting Elizabeth know, or, you know, not trying to play God.",,2020-07-12T16:01:34Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1
hpwhxb_2,hpwhxb,"I also recently finished the book and although I appreciate your review, I disagree with the innocence in which you paint Frankenstein's character. The flippancy in which Frankenstein rejects and disregards his creation, even at the time of creation when the creature is most helpless and alone, implicates responsibility over the circumstances that then proceed. You say a father cannot be responsible for the actions of his child - but what about if you considered the situation if this were the story of a father and child, rather than of a father and monster? Certainly, the monster is evil too, especially after he is fully sapient and understanding of his crimes. However, as someone else said, the monster's actions are those of someone who is desperate, while Frankenstein's actions are those of someone who is selfish and egotistical. Frankenstein gambles with people's lives the entire book - is haphazardly risking an innocent friend's life that much better than actively taking a life? I think this discussion is really what makes the novel so fascinating - it really provokes the thoughts of how the reader assesses responsibility, how the reader perceived who is a victim, and how the reader determines accountability of someone based on the circumstances that led them to committing an act. In my opinion, both parties are guilty, but Frankenstein is primarily responsible for igniting the flame, ignoring every aspect of human nature (as he perceives his creation as lacking human nature - would the situation not have been avoided if he treated the monster as a human? Instead he gives him the mental ability of a human, denies him his humanity, and then shuns him for acting on his human nature when faced with desperation and solitude), and failing to take any responsibility for his actions.

Edit: thinking more about it, it is even worse than I initially thought. The novel is written by Frankenstein as the protagonist. And even still, we feel that he holds responsibility in his actions. Yet, he is the author, writing the events how he perceives them. This creates massive bias of us viewing the monster as a monster, and a wretched creature. So we further perceive and characterize the monster as evil and Frankenstein as the victim. However, at the time when we hear the monster's tale of his story at the cabin, we empathize with him as we understand he is only human. Then we go back to Frankenstein's perspective, further removing the monster's narratives, abandoning his feelings, and heightening our concept of him as evil. Ask yourself - how would your perception of right and wrong change if the entire narrative was written in the monster's perspective, rather than in Frankenstein's?",,2020-07-12T16:25:17Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,2
hpwhxb_3,hpwhxb,"There are a lot of good discussions here already, so I'll just add that Mary Shelley's parents, William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, wrote a lot about education and how it shapes a person. Mary Shelly was raised hearing and reading a lot about the topic and also idolized her mother (who died a few days after MS's birth). 

You can make quite a sound argument that *Frankenstein* is a continuation of the debate about educational philosophy (although there is obviously a lot more going on in the novel). If you read it from that point of view, the creature's crimes do indeed fall squarely on Victor's shoulders because it was his moral imperative to educate his creation and he refused to do so.",secondhandbanshee,2020-07-12T16:51:26Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,3
hpwhxb_4,hpwhxb,"Part of the moral center of the book is in the subtitle: The Modern Prometheus. 

The gods tortured Prometheus for eternity for the crime of giving fire to humankind (which he is also often crediting with creating from clay) and possibly their ability to procreate again. While there are multiple interpretations of this set of legends, one common variant considered popular in 18th and 19th centuries is one based on fire being roughly equivalent to the ability to commit mortal sins through industry as well the connotations of original sin. 

Consider with this that Mary Shelley’s father was an early utilitarian who was a major critic of the aristocracy. 

So, Victor Frankenstein is the prime immoral agent, creating life from nothing. He creates not a child but a full-grown man, giving no consideration to raising it morally. He abandons it and gives Adam nothing, no love, no comfort, no education, nothing. 

In this act of extreme negligence, Victor thus unleashed a creature with the strength and vigor and natural drives of a human animal onto the world. He then takes no steps to protect others, keeping his creation to himself, not bearing the responsibility of either hunting down the creature and ending the situation or revealing to the authorities all that he can so that they’ll take action. 

Victor plays god but acts like a selfish brat when faced with the consequences, essentially. And then people die again and again. He is aloof from society and its institutions, caring only to preserve himself and his safety. And he doesn’t even recognize his motives usually. 

In refusing to create the woman for Adam, he deprives Adam of the one possible and central drive that humans have, thus making the creature worse than he was before. By this point, Adam has learned to read and has seen and even felt the joy of human companionship. However, Victor has made him so ghastly in appearance that he is rejected by strangers. He then returns to the only person he knows who can and will help him, his creator. 

While we might blame this on the strangers being unkind, this isn’t a normal situation. If Victor wanted to  be God, then he should have taken care to give the creature the visage of a good and wholesome person, rather than merely making it “good enough”. In some ways, this reflects the growing connection between aesthetics and ethics, which is explored on The Strange Case in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, and other works of the time. Victor’s insulated moral wickedness is reflected in the physical deformity of Adam and the social isolation it brings to him. 

I’ve wandered a bit but those are some somewhat brief thoughts on why Victor is ultimately immoral rather than the creature alone.",ebookish1234,2020-07-12T16:42:21Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,4
hpwhxb_5,hpwhxb,"TLDR: You fail to consider the monster’s mental health/social development at all, and you are way too forgiving of Victor’s many  shortcomings. 


Frankenstein does build a new body out of parts and gives it life, but he doesn't do it to create a servant, a soldier, or a monster. 

• Debatable. Victor frequently refers to the creature as his slave who should be obeying its master. At best, he fears and despises the creature for being ugly, and refuses to acknowledge that as a sentient being, the creature has certain needs and rights that Victor is responsible for providing. 

He does it out of (admittedly misguided) scientific curiosity and expects that his experiments will help mankind. 

• Again, debatable. I think you’re giving Victor too much credit, he speaks about “earning his place” more than he does helping others. In fact, he specifically says his interest in the life sciences was about achieving personal glory. Additionally, his curiosity isn’t misguided. If he hadn’t been such a coward, and cared for his creation, he really would have changed the world for the better. 

After giving life to the body, he realizes his mistakes 

• what mistake? Everything worked perfectly. 

and flees his laboratory, only to later return and find the creature missing. This is pretty much the only thing that Frankenstein does wrong in the novel, in my opinion, rejecting his own creation at first. 

• Letting Justine die, lying to Elizabeth, lying to the monster, destroying the bride, and allowing everyone who cared about Victor to suffer for his vanity? That all gets a pass? 

This does mean that Frankenstein is somewhat responsible for everything that happens next, but it is not all too different from a regular child in my opinion. A father cannot be blamed for the crimes of his son, regardless of how they were raised.

• Frankenstein creates an adult and unleashed it on the world, running away from the consequences. It’s not child abandonment, it’s more akin to opening a tiger cage at a zoo. 

The creature, at first with the mind of a newborn, unable to speak and with no memory, flees into the forest and lives of nuts and berries. Eventually, he finds refuge in a hovel next to the house of a family, from which he learns to speak and read by eavesdropping on them. When he tries to approach them to take him in as a friend, they are scared away by his hideous appearance. The creature starts hating all of humanity after this, but especially his creator, whose name he has now learned.

This is the turning point for me when considering which of the two of them are the most monstrous. I think that many people have gotten the idea that the creature is either a mindless beast or has the intelligence of a small child that doesn't know what they are doing. After this point, the creature is just as intelligent and eloquent as any other adult. In fact, since the family he was learning from was a noble family, 

• they weren’t, they were three people living in a cottage. Minor point, but it’s a strange detail to change.

he is probably more intelligent by the 18th-century standard. 

• why does it matter how well he’s is able to read and speak? You act like the emotional and mental health of the creature doesn’t matter because he is able to read well, and I don’t understand why. People aren’t robots. We don’t raise children by throwing them into the woods with a few books and checking in on them once they’ve memorized it. Humans are social creatures, and without proper social development they go insane. The monster’s experiences would never have allowed for anything but a raging lunatic to develop. 

It is only now that the creature begins performing actions out of hatred for Frankenstein. He travels to Frankenstein's hometown of Geneva, finds Frankenstein's younger brother and kills him. He then frames one of their childhood friends for the murder, for which she is hanged.

• which again Victor could easily have stopped

It is at this point you wonder; surely it would be morally justified for the creature to attack and kill Frankenstein himself, but how can it be justified that it kills his brother and gets their friend sentenced to death? Neither of them knew anything about Frankenstein's work or had anything to do with it. The creature is fully sentient, sapient, and aware of its action, so surely it must be evil at this point? Many people have been rejected by society for a number of things but do not go on killing sprees for it.

• sure, the creature is morally wrong here. But you, much like Victor, are somewhat obtuse lay refusing to look at things from the creatures perspective. He declares war against all of humanity, because all of the humans he’s interacted with have reacted with hatred, disgust, and fear, all because he is different looking. He has never been treated with kindness, or been able to build healthy social bonds, or know a mother’s love. All of the essential steps in healthy development are skipped. He acts like a feral beast because, despite his literacy, he is. 

After this, the creature demands that Frankenstein build him a female companion, 

• entirely reasonable, this is the least victor could do. No man is an island. 

after which they will disappear in the South American jungles forever. If he does not do it, the creature threatens to kill Frankenstein's bride on their wedding night. 

• this is completely false. The monster makes no threats to Victor until after watching his only hope for happiness destroyed. 

After initially agreeing, Frankenstein changes his mind and destroys the female. He does not do this either out of hatred, revenge, or malice. 

• Seriously? Hatred, revenge, and malice are perfect descriptions of Victor’s motivations. 

He is worried that the female will either hate the male creature, turning him even worse, that she will be eviler than him, or that they will have children that eventually destroy humanity. 

• again, Victor’s post hoc rationalizations for why he did a horrible thing shouldn’t be taken as fact. He’s been making excuses for himself all novel. 

For betraying him, the creature kills Frankenstein's best friend and his new wife.

Am I wrong in thinking that the creature himself did just as much wrong or more than Frankenstein did? 

• if you make a tally sheet of the actions of each of them with no context, sure, the monster did worse things because murder is worse than just about anything. But looking at things in such a simplistic lense isn’t really helpful. 

Frankenstein has only himself to blame for his misery, 

• and yet he doesn’t. He blames a lot of people and forces outside of his control, but never has a serious moment of introspection. To his dying breath, he blames his creation for everything that happened after he fled the lab. Even his creation, as deranged as he is, is able to have a higher degree of self awareness for the wrongness of his actions than Victor. 

but what about all of the innocent people that the creature killed, all of them after he gained the intelligence of a normal person? I honestly expected a much different story based on what I have heard about it over the years, with the creature often discussed as misunderstood or friendly in nature, rather than the hateful, revenge-seeking, murderer it is in the book.

• he read a half dozen books in a forest, and you’re ready to deem him as responsible for his actions as an adult? Just because he has more sophisticated linguistic intelligence does not mean he has any degree of emotional maturity, social intelligence, or mental stability. Also, why does the abuse he’s suffered not mean anything? Victor is a rich kid with loving parents, friends, a healthy love life, and still manages to be a terrible person. The monster is forced to live on the fringes of society, constantly shunned, belittled, and demonized by everyone. He isn’t given a name. He is never shown any respect.

I agree with you that the creature acts in terrible ways but I think that this is because of the neglect he suffers and complete rejection.

I think a lot of the creatures dialogue around being ‘Adam’ gets at this. Frankenstein is his creator and wrong to just abandon him. 

Within this you can then start to wonder about morality and the role of nature vs nurture. Was the creature made bad as a result of Frankenstein rejecting him, followed by other people rejecting him too?

I also think you can’t overlook the title of ‘modern prometheus’. To some extent the creature is there to represent the means by which Frankenstein is punished for going against the ‘natural’ creation in favour of science.

So the statement is not about which one is morally worse. Although, as you point out, it’s an interesting question. 

The book is brilliant, no? Some say it created the genre of science fiction. 

I think one of the reasons it is so good is that it can be interpreted in so many ways. It was written by a pregnant 18-year-old woman (who had previously miscarried), so “creating life” can be read as childbirth, and the relationship between the creator and monster is about parenthood. 

Or: her poet husband “created” her as an artist, so she is the monster. 

Or: the relation between creator and created is a metaphor for the relationship between God and man. We are all the monster. 

Or: the monster is a metaphor for technology. Recent developments in artificial intelligence are already considered to be an existential threat to humanity.

The fact that it takes the constant disgust and fear from human beings to turn him towards revenge makes him a more complicated character.

hpwhxb_19,hpwhxb,"They are both anti-heroes essentially. Victor is the epitome of child abandonment and a neglectful father. Sure the creature becomes a murderer and that’s awful as well. But it’s because he lacked the guiding influence that Frankenstein should have provided but ultimately rejected.

Is the Creature still responsible for the murder? Yes. But it’s easy to imagine that if Frankenstein had been more involved the Creature never would have turned to murder in the first place. The Creature still has agency but much of his worldview was shaped by a neglectful creator.

Frankenstein’s hamatia is his ego and the rejection of his creation. Well that and the fact that he still lets Justine die. Is he a 100% bad person? No. But he does create the situations through his abandonment that leads to much of his own suffering.

Neither the creator or the creation are good people. Both are flawed. But these flaws are related to the core of who they are and their interactions with each other.",TraparCyclone,2020-07-16T05:44:23Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,19

I look at the book from a few different perspectives; how it shines a light on society, religion, technology, feminism, and responsibilities. In all ways of looking at it both Frankenstein and the creature have good and bad qualities, the reader can sympathize with, and despise, both characters easily and equally. However, I do not think they are direct parallels to eachother so I don't think it's fair to say either are worse than the other.

In my personal opinion I think they're both as bad as eachother, it's one of the reasons I love the book so much as there isn't supposed to be a single character that is the clear monster of the story; instead it forces you to think about why they are the way they are and suddenly the larger concepts become the subject of discussion. 

Also as a sidenote, if you can find it National Theatre have a recorded version of the stage play with Benedict Cumberbatch and Johnny Lee Miller who play Frankenstein and the creature interchangeably. They both bring very different performances to each character and it's a fantastic way of comparing/contrasting the two.",nataliemullan,2020-07-12T17:02:55Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,21

wwudjn_2,wwudjn,"it's so tragic to see the contrast between the way people treat the monster and his capacity for generosity/friendliness.  it's clear he would have been exceedingly kind if he had been treated with kindness.  He shows more patience with his poor treatment than pretty much any human would.

frankenstein's shock and dismay at the horror of the monster is understandable.  I think his trauma comes not just from realizing how ugly the monster is, but from realizing that his grand experiment which he expected to be a worthy endeavor turned out to be so antithetical to nature.  he flouted a dramatic law of nature and expected to feel triumphant for it.  The whiplash of his fear from seeing how abominable the monster was traumatized him, especially since he thought this moment would be proud, and he seemingly didn't realize that the monster has intelligence.

but once the monster demonstrates his intelligence to frankenstein, frankenstein should have reevaluated. it's frustrating that he refuses to try to see the monster's perspective.  I can sympathize with frankenstein's horror and disgust at the results of his experiment, but at a certain point once he knew of the monster's sentience, he should have considered that the monster's utter rejection from the world it lives in is his own fault and that it's his responsibility as its creator to fix things (and not just by killing the monster). he had years of time to empathize with the monster, but he did not.  I wonder how much of that comes from his sheer disgust with the monster, and how much of that comes from an involuntary refusal to acknowledge the monster's humanity (which would then force frankenstein to admit his awful treatment of an intelligent being).

Even when he concedes to the monster's request, frankenstein STILL barely acknowledges the monster's personal experiences (and IIRC he doesn't actually acknowledge anything in conversation with the monster -- only to the sailor he's recounting the story to).",ActivateGuacamole,2022-08-24T22:46:25Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,2

For funsies, I’d recommend reading them alongside: Wollstonecraft’s ‘Vindication’ to see how Shelley was inspired by her mother and Paradise Lost to see what allusions she drew from that text. (The wretch reads Paradise Lost and not the Bible)

Also, Frankenstein may not be lauded as a pop culture icon like Harry Potter, but it is immensely celebrated within Gothic studies and the like.

I think the idea, especially with Frankenstein, is that he's not taking care of himself and thus becomes ill. We know with the first creation, he was working night and day and not really eating, so it makes sense that he would become sick. And then the second really bad fever is after creation 2, and a severe shock.

Victor also started his journey wanting scientific knowledge; but neither wants knowledge for knowledge’s sake. They both talk about their dreams of glory for being the ones to “discover” in their respective fields. Both the Creature and Frankenstein make excuses about their nature and how their parents set them on their paths (Victor’s father let him read terrible science books, the Creature’s father abandoned him). The opening letters to Walton’s sister mirror that, but listening to Victor’s tale changes him and allows him to realize he can’t abandon humanity in exchange for glory. The book isn’t about “science=bad.” It’s about maintaining humanity and listening to others. I see the ending as hopeful because Walton decides not to make the mistakes, Victor and the Creature did.

Given the context of Frankenstein - an artificial human, with a face, who confronts both his maker and the wider world, who then look back at him and judge him... do you not think the word ‘countenance’ with its complex sense of expression, judgement and approval might be a key term used very deliberately?

f10h7f_1,f10h7f,"Some background is in order.

At the time she wrote Frankenstein, Mary was living in Switzerland with her step-sister Claire.  

She was a second-generation modern.  Her mother,  Mary Wollenscraft, had written a tract called *A Vindication of the Rights of Women,* and had lived with a married man and borne a child out of wedlock.  Her father, William Godwin, was a minister turned freethinker, author of a radical critique of society called *Social Justice, a*nd a social novel, *Caleb Williams.*

Poet Percy Blyshe Shelley had been dismissed from Oxford University in 1811 for authoring a pamphlet entitled *The Necessity of Atheism.*  He sought out Godwin as the foremost freethinker of the day.  He met Mary Godwin at her parent's home in 1814 when she was sixteen.  With the aid of Mary's stepsister, Claire, he eloped with her.  Shelley was five years older, and married, with a child and another on the way, but no matter.

She began Frankenstein in 1816, when she and Shelley were living with Claire near Geneva, Switzerland.  She had borne Shelley two children, one of whom had died two months after birth. She and Shelley would not be married until December of that year, when his previous wife committed suicide.

Their party was joined by poet George Gordon Byron (Lord Byron), with whom Claire was having an affair and would bear a daughter in 1817.  He and Shelley hit it off well.  Along with Byron was his physician, Dr. John Polidori.

The weather was inclement, and they were amusing themselves by reading ghost stories. Lord Byron proposed to the party that each of them should write a ghost story. All agreed to try.  Shelley had been pushing Mary to write as her parents had.  But she foundered on coming up with a story.

The impasse was broken when she listened to a conversation between Byron and Shelley.  They were discussing whether the underlying principle of life might be discovered, and referred to the experiments of Dr. Erasmus Darwin (the grandfather of Charles Darwin), who had preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass jar till it exhibited independent motion, with galvanism likely involved.  Luigi Galvani had performed experiments where he caused severed frog's legs to move through the application of electricity, giving us the term *galvanism* to describe it.

Mary went to bed but could not sleep, as the concept for Frankenstein formed in her head.  She began writing it the next day.

The literary roots of Frankenstein go back rather farther, and the progenitor was likely Horace Walpole's *The Castle of Otranto.*  Indeed, Frankenstein was first published anonymously, with a preface by Shelley which made the same sorts of qualifications Walpole made in his book.

Victor Frankenstein is an engaging but ultimately tragic character.  The essence of tragedy is inevitability.  The protagonists will fail and tragedy will ensue because they are the kind of people they are.  (This is not a *moral* judgement.  Failure is not evidence of sin or evil, but rather of inability to deal with what confronts them.) 

Victor performs a successful experiment, but cannot handle the implications of his success.  He runs away, and this turns his creation against him  Things spiral down from there.

This not being at all sure how they feel about things is characteristic of the society of the time.  Mary is confronted with the possibility of man usurping the rights of the Creator and creating new life.  Frankenstein is her attempt to sort out her feelings about it, and it's unsurprising she's not at all sure it's a good idea.

You can likely easily come up with lists of current SF with the same preoccupations, focusing on things like AI and genetic engineering.  The things discussed have the potential to transform the world.  Whether the end result is desirable  is another matter.",cuivenian,2020-02-09T14:41:03Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1
108ybb5_1,108ybb5,"I think this is accurate, but also glazes over one of the motifs. Frankenstein is a classic example of the Nature vs. Nurture question. Do you become evil, or is evil something you are born with? In many instances, Victor seems evil in nature. His arrogant personality, actions, and thoughts, while easy to write off as reasonable in this situation, speak to biblical sins. Therefore, we can comfortably say that Victor is naturally evil. On the other side, the Creature, while acting in ways that are evil, does not have evil at heart. The Creature is not nurtured by Victor, or anyone else for that matter, and thus is shown the harshness of the world around him. He does evil things, but he does them out of a deep sense of hurt from parental and societal rejection. Victor's actions, however, are not due to a lack of nurturing. Victor was a wealthy, and well-cared for man. He was embraced by society, yet was still evil. Thus he is considered the real monster.",cj0813,2023-02-08T20:37:34Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1

What I will comment on is the idea that you have to feel fear for something to be horror. There’s no requirement for horror to scare you. Fear is subject and what scares me might not scare you. What is important when we look at horror is what the intent was and what elements that work has. Horror should make an attempt to horrify, terrify, disgust, shock, etc.

Frankenstein willingly married Elizabeth knowing the threat, and without warning her at all or allowing her the ability to make informed decisions. He never even conciders the threat was against her because everything is about him. Remember when he said of the condemned chick, that he suffered more than the woman who was going to die did? Asshole. His hysterical fleeing from the life he spent months creating was infuriating to me. He never once stopped to concider the implications and when the thing moves he screams and runs? Asshole. His refusal to build a bride was the ONE time he actually almost fully thought the implications of his actions through. Why he didnt realize the monster would go after his friends baffles me though. I wonder if he committed suicide to deny the monster a target, would that have saved everyone else? But no, he figured he could beat the superhuman vengeful monster without innocent casualties even though he was specifically warned they would happen. Asshole.

As for the monster.... yeah. Rough start. I seriously felt for him.

Yes your life sucks, but does it justify hating the entire human race and making any violence against anyone just because you felt like it okay? No. At that point you are a psychopath.

There are, for example, works that we know are lost, which practically no-one is 'talking about', and no-one could be reading, but which are *still* of greater importance than works we have which are 'talked about'.",varro-reatinus,2018-05-31T09:10:04Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,10
8nds41_11,8nds41,"That's rather an expansive question. (I take it you feel I've addressed all your previous concerns, so we're moving on to this one.)

I would suggest first that it's more efficient to debunk spurious claims of importance than to attempt to set up some kind of arbitrary rubric for determining importance. (That's how we get into a 'without feathers' scenario.)

To put it another way, works of genuine importance are relatively scarce, so it's easier to say what isn't than what is.

That said, I think I can take a rough stab at it.

To paraphrase Whitehead on Plato, the safest general characterisation of literary importance is that 'a major work' must stand in notable relation to prior art (in the technical sense).

If you write a dialogue, your work must stand comparison with Plato and Peacock in order to be called important.

If you write a play, your work must stand comparison with Aeschylus and Shakespeare.

If you write a satire, your work must stand comparison with Swift, Pope, Juvenal, Horace, etc.

That's not to say it's impossible to compare works beyond their formal, generic, or specific contexts. For example, i don't even think *Frankenstein* is the best piece of work to emerge from that rather dreary 'Year without a Summer' 1816 sojourn at the Villa Diodati; that would be Byron's ""Darkness,"" which isn't a great poem, but is at least a skillful one.",varro-reatinus,2018-05-31T11:43:14Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,11
8nds41_12,8nds41,"My criteria are simpler and, in recognition of the ultimate subjectivity of any attempt to compare works on technical merits, pertain more to the relation of the work to society.

If something keeps bringing people back to a work, it's important - whether that be its immediate impact on the zeitgeist, or some thematic element, or the beauty of the language, or some other element that has broad and lasting appeal.

Frankenstein is not a perfect work - personally, I find it rather purple, though charmingly so. But some aspect, whether the grotesque concept of the creature or the broader themes of hubris and ambition and all that, allowed the novel to escape its cool early reception.

8nds41_13,8nds41,"> My criteria are simpler and, in recognition of the ultimate subjectivity of any attempt to compare works on technical merits, pertain more to the relation of the work to society.

Are you actually suggesting that ""the relation of the work to society"" is *less* subjective?

I would gently suggest that several decades of historicist scholarship is available to refute your implicit claim that ""society"" is a singular, monolithic constant. I don't agree with the historicists about much, but they're right about that.

I find it curious that you tried to reduce what I said to ""technical merits"" and subjective evaluations of quality, because I said nothing of the sort; that's a gross misrepresentation of what I said.

I said very clearly that my governing criterion were about *relative* and *comparative* evaluation.

I'm also not sure how expecting people to know about ""the relation of the work to society"" in toto is ""simpler"" than comparing apples and oranges respectively -- even if talking about ""society"" as a whole was reasonable, which it isn't.

> If something keeps bringing people back to a work, it's important - whether that be its immediate impact on the zeitgeist, or some thematic element, or the beauty of the language, or some other element that has broad and lasting appeal.

And I would point you back to the case of *Uncle Tom's Cabin*.

What keeps ""bringing people back"" to that work is predominantly a spurious anecdote involving Lincoln, that was invented by the family to market Stowe's works decades after the alleged meeting.

Similarly, I would suggest that what 'keeps bringing people back' to Shelley's novel is not the work itself, but a variety of later derivative works that have basically nothing to do with it, except the deeply misleading outline of 'someone makes a monster by accident, bad things ensue', which is a plot as old as literature itself.

> Frankenstein is not a perfect work - personally, I find it rather purple, though charmingly so.

I think we're in agreement that personal taste is not a meaningful criterion, even if we're talking about the taste of an important critic.

Samuel Johnson hated *Gulliver's Travels*; he was mistaken.

And I like that you just undercut your own suggestion that ""the beauty of the language"" could be part of what ""something keeps bringing people back"" to *Frankenstein*.

> But some aspect, whether the grotesque concept of the creature or the broader themes of hubris and ambition and all that, allowed the novel to escape its cool early reception.

But the mere presence of ""broader themes of hubris and ambition and all that"" could be attested in many works, including many that are not only unimportant but incompetent. They cannot be used as criteria.

> It will never be forgotten.

That is an enormous and entirely untestable claim.",varro-reatinus,2018-05-31T12:49:44Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,13
3i5rv3_1,3i5rv3,"> Is he monstrous because he abandons his newborn creature, viewing him with disgust? Well, sure, that's undeniably a shitty thing to do, but I think to call him a ""monster"" for this goes too far.

I think that he is monstrous for abandoning his creature. It is not just a ""shitty thing"", it is his tragic and fatal mistake.

We, as readers, know how little help the creature would have needed to become truly good. If we trust the creature's narration, its intention were good until they were frustrated several times. And for the simple reason that the creature is ugly. No other reason that that. People see it and are afraid and throw stones at it. No creature, no matter how patient and kind, can stand ostracism and hate for too long.

But Frankenstein didn't know how little help the creature would have needed.

So, what do I blame Frankenstein for?

I don't blame Frankenstein for giving life to the creature. ""Hybris"" and all of that are not crimes on their own - or better, it's easy to cry ""hybris"" when someone is trying to do something new. Two hundred years ago a group of brilliant doctors decided to eradicate the plague and typhus and so on. People screamed that it was hybris. A Pope wrote a Papal Encyclica where he said clearly that it was folly (I wish I still had the source of this). Result? Who cares about ""hybris"", we have actually succeeded. Our ""hybris"" wins, and without any bad consequence, the plague has disappeared. Gone. Vanished. Good riddance. We were right in ""playing God"" and destroying a species of Bacteria. We were right and we were successful and nobody regrets that we did ""play God"".

No, ""hybris"" doesn't make Frankenstein a monster. Refusing to even look at his creation, however, does.

Frankenstein had responsibilities. To the creature, and to the society of man. The creature might be an independent being, but that doesn't mean that Frankenstein can run away as he did. What fool abandons a creation in a society that is sure to hate it? Conversely, what fool lets loose a ""monster"" in the middle of a city?

And let it be clear, Frankenstein never gives the poor creature a chance! Not for a second he hesitates in refusing his creature. Why? Either because he is ashamed of his hybris and folly (both things are irrelevant to the character of the creature) or because is disgusted by the ugliness of the creature (and this once again the fault is Frankenstein's). How damn unfair is this? Completely. What has the newborn creature done to deserve this? Nothing: the newborn creature has literally done nothing except walking into its maker's bedroom and trying to speak.

At the end, to me the tale of Frankenstein is really a moral parable on what happens when our creation is alien to us.

We have two choices: we either accept our creation, or hate it from the moment of its creation.

Frankenstein may say that he is a coward, that he is weak, that he has made too many mistakes, but his only fatal mistake was never giving the creature a chance.

From the moment that the creature's heart beat its first beat, Frankenstein could no longer see a living being but could only see a monster. And this, fittingly, makes Frankenstein a monster.",MaracCabubu,2015-08-24T21:36:29Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1

I don't at all mean that assessment positively; I mean just that it's normal (""human"") to regret decisions, to back out of commitments. It's not commendable, but it's not *monstrous.*

Now, to be fair, ""backing out of commitments"" becomes a lot more morally questionable when the commitment in question is your child... however, I do hesitate using the word ""child"" to refer to the Creature. I know the monster reveres Frankenstein as his father, but does Frankenstein ever mention returning the sentiment? From  the impression I had (and please do dig up any quotes to the contrary if you can; it's entirely possible I missed some things), Victor throughout the assembly process never really thought of the creature as a child, but more like a project--it doesn't seem like Victor cared as much about *what* he would create as for the *proof* that he could create something in the first place. Which, again, I'd say is very hubristic... and actually, now that I think about it, I'd say that that begins leaning towards the monstrous, to wantonly create life just to prove that you can, without regards to how the new life will feel or need.

3i5rv3_6,3i5rv3,"They happened before & during the writing of Frankenstein.

Byron had pushed Percey Shelley into the idea of open relationships -alledgedly to sleep with Mary- but Percy wanted to be with Mary's sister -who according to several biographers was intensely jealous & wanted Perey to herself.

Mary Shelley's strained relationships with men from a young age, especially how Byron & others dominated Percy's life, supposedly influenced a lot of how she created the character of Victor -as young, egotistic and unable to take responsibility for his actions. Where as the old blind man who teaches Adam is meant to be men such as her father, who were teachers.

Also factor in the new sciences & philosophies that Mary was studying, which put forward the idea of nurture over nature.

Basically, if you take it all back to Milton & Paradise Lost (which Adam reads and from which names himself), Victor Frankenstein is a seen as the figure of a selfish god who, seeing what he has created chooses to abandon it rather than take responsibility. This is further pushed when creating the mate & Victor envisions it choosing him over Adam or them birthing a race of monsters which will usurp man (as man did the angels in Milton).
As a man, Victor's only response are abandonment & destruction and, as a child, Adam can only feel adoration for his creator before it turns to bitter loathing over the realisation that he was not only unwanted & unloved but never intended to be in the first place.",andthegeekshall,2015-08-24T06:14:15Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,6
3i5rv3_7,3i5rv3,"The book was originally published in 1818, and her first miscarriage was in 1815. My copy of the book has a really great critical essay on the enduring legacy of Mary Shelly through *Frankenstein*, and this is a pretty good paragraph:

> Considering how insecure Mary was about her creative and reproductive capabilities, *Frankenstein* can be read as ""a woman's myth-making on the subject of birth,"" according to Ellen Moers in the ground-breaking study *Literary Women* (1976). Int he novel, Victor learns the hard way of the consequences of usurping the female pro-genitive role. As he labors to create his monster, Victor experiences pain and insecurities that are typical of pregnancy's gestation period; his shock at seeing his deformed and hideous progeny at birth must have been shard by most nineteenth-century women, in their ignorance and fear of the birth process. Most power of all (and the subject of most of he novel) are his feelings of depression and detachment after the actual birth. Even in our time, post-partum depression remains a misunderstood and often misdiagnosed condition; for Shelly in 1818 to depict the negative consequences of this disease left untreated was a revolutionary act. ""The idea that a mother can loath, fear, and reject her baby has until recently been on of the most repressed of psychological insights,"" writes Barbara Johsnon in ""My Monster/My Self,"" another important feminist essay. ""What is threatening about [*Frankenstein*] is the way in which its critique of the role of the mother touches us on primitive terrors of the mother's rejection of the child"". As a writer who was also a mother (a rare combination nineteenth-century England), Shelly broke down long-standing rules of propriety by retelling the myth of origin from the female point of view.

""II.  Two principles in human nature reign;

Self-love to urge, and reason, to restrain;
Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call,
Each works its end, to move or govern all
And to their proper operation still,
Ascribe all good; to their improper, ill.

Self-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul;
Reason’s comparing balance rules the whole.
Man, but for that, no action could attend,
And but for this, were active to no end:

Fixed like a plant on his peculiar spot,
To draw nutrition, propagate, and rot;
Or, meteor-like, flame lawless through the void,
Destroying others, by himself destroyed.

Most strength the moving principle requires;
Active its task, it prompts, impels, inspires.
Sedate and quiet the comparing lies,
Formed but to check, deliberate, and advise.

Self-love still stronger, as its objects nigh;
Reason’s at distance, and in prospect lie:
That sees immediate good by present sense;
Reason, the future and the consequence.""

6z99jh_1,6z99jh,I think Frankenstein expresses *regret* not remorse in the book. He only cares because his experiments are affecting his life negatively. He's an extremely selfish character.,CroweMorningstar,2017-09-10T16:48:18Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1
6z99jh_2,6z99jh,">So his ambition becomes his downfall: still, he carries it with such a responsibility that it practically demands respect.

He expresses remorse, but the way the book skims over the actual motives of why he created it suggests that his thought process prior never really stretched beyond ""why not?""

He essentially stuck a fork in the light socket of the universe just to see what would happen.

Then with his creation he never takes on himself the critical responsibility of actually treating it as a human. He just wants it disposed of as an accident, which is why it becomes a ""monster"". 

Danny Boyle worked with Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller on a stage production of Frankenstein a few years ago where both actors would alternate roles each night as monster and creator. One interesting thing about the production is that the script of the adaptation started with the birth of the monster, cutting everything before hand, so the audience POV is firmly from the view of the monster as it first experiences into the world. 

Part of the point of the story was that the monster was a true blank slate (maybe the first in history, a creature created completely from whole cloth) that could have been anything, and Frankenstein fucked it up with his shitty influence and lack of moral guidance. The fact that Frankenstein regrets the monster being born doesn't make him a good guy - is a parent who abandons his kid because he regrets it being born a good parent?",potat-o,2017-09-10T21:08:33Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,2

But you're absolutely right. The way Frankenstein handles the situation post-creation is reproachable in every way, he abandons it in his sickness and cares not for its existence until it influences his own life. 

Still, I don't think this makes him an entirely bad person. Selfish perhaps, but nevertheless skilled and accomplished. We forget how pleasing he was in the first chapters on the novel. I'm willing to wager a defense for him. ",IndifferentTalker,2017-09-11T00:54:20Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,7

And overall I'm in complete agreement. His actions after the creation of the monster are entirely reproachable--and I agree with that last point too: no doubt an element of the monster's turmoil is directly caused by Frankenstein himself.

And yet, I feel as though Frankenstein takes responsibility for certain things that are entirely out of his control. His initial treatment of the monster after creating him is a response to his (SPOILER) murder of William, and after that he expresses a true sadness for what he's created. Perhaps he wouldn't have felt remorse if the monster had not directly affected his life, but it's remorse nevertheless. 

I wonder if Frankenstein would've treated his creation as equals if their first meeting was not under dire circumstances. Some may say he would've condemned it anyway, some may disagree.",IndifferentTalker,2017-09-11T01:03:55Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,8

73z3a9_3,73z3a9,"One of the reasons I like reading classics is to be able to compare the actual source to pop-culture representation.

You have people proclaiming things like ""Frankenstein is the _real_ monster, his creation just a victim."" Well, that's not really what I got from the book at all. The monster _did_ undeniably monstrous things - things that are inexcusable. All attempts at justification come from the culprit themselves - a very intelligent and ruthless culprit. It is kept open for interpretation if the monster is telling the truth or just attempting to manipulate. Mary Shelley did a great job at emphasizing Frankenstein's inner conflict and projecting it to the reader.

Regarding the actual story, my biggest surprise so far was Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. There is a big difference between the full version and the children's version, which skips over some experiences. Reading the final rant of the main character makes the existence of a ""children's version"" also kind of tragic.

Regarding characters I was really surprised by Alexandre Dumas's The Three Musketeers. I never expected the ""heroes"" to be such unpleasant examples of douchebaggery.

In the past year the biggest surprises for me were Vilette by Charlotte Bronte (positive) and Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (negative).

I expected to dislike the main heroine in Vilette, because I expected her to be similar to Emma Bovary, Effie Briest, Catherine Earnshaw, or Caroline Meeber. Luckily I was mistaken and I ended up rooting for her, which made the end all the more tragic. (I find it difficult to really like a book if I cannot like at least one of the main characters. Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert is one of the exceptions. Love the book, hate the character.)

I expected Robinson Crusoe to be a normal classic - maybe a bit difficult to get through, but worth a read nonetheless. How bad could it be? There were children's cartoons made based on it, right? Turns out it is eye-openingly bad. Not only is the main theme that you are not supposed to rebel against your station in life (or you get repeatedly shipwrecked), but you have the main character spending sheer endless monologues about the White Man's Burden and similar topics. It is good that the book exists as evidence for changing pop culture and I am glad that I read it, but I did not expect that.",EQ2bRpDBQWRk1W,2017-10-03T11:23:36Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,3

73z3a9_5,73z3a9,"One thing I never quite understood about ""Frankenstein"" is how her female characters are the typical damsel in distress. She was the daughter of Wolstencraft (a women's rights activists) and I cannot readily imagine Byron nor Percy having a problem with a slightly more empowered female supporting character. At first I suspected that it was due to the era, but Austen had published several novels before ""Frankenstein"" and certainly would have been a known author.  I'm not saying the novella is bad, I rather enjoyed it, but I always found this facet of it a little surprising and disappointing.  


A novel that surprised me was ""Disgrace: A Novel"" by J.M. Coetzee. I found myself empathizing with the protagonist and even understanding some of his fears. The reason this is surprising is that he is a racist.  The book is both powerful and disturbing.

The point of Frankenstein isn’t necessarily the creation of the monster. It’s the psychological impact it has. It’s a science fiction psychological thriller with religious undertones.

It’s about the punishment that can come when someone reaches beyond. The monster is social commentary but it’s more about the limits of science and the role or limitations of religion. It’s also about the complications of birth, considering Mary Shelley’s very complex relationship with birth (her birth killed her mother, she had several miscarriages prior to writing the book) so in some ways it’s semi-autobiographical.

It’s certainly not for everyone. It’s slow, and it’s not full of outright horror but more of the slow building dread. It’s more closely related to something like Crime and Punishment than some of the more classical horror works.

7i0s5p_1,7i0s5p,"I really liked the ending; if it feels jarring and unsatisfying, that is because Shelley got you to relate well to the Frankenstein's monster. At the end, he's left with nothing; mid-novel he recognized that he turned to evil because his creator reviled him. In the end he realizes how dedicating himself to revenge only left him empty, but he is unable to better himself with that knowledge. He is unable to gain enough self-identity independent of Frankenstein to be able to feel like he matters at all outside his creator. 

I think it can relate well to social media (deriving self-identity and value from your online presence) or any other unhealthy system of self-worth we impose on ourselves. Obviously, we are different from Frankenstein's monster in that we aren't created by these things, but people often give themselves to social media or what have you just as much as if it did create them.",isotopes_ftw,2017-12-06T22:53:44Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1

It's a compelling statement about the power of stories in shaping our most fundamental moral and perceptual judgments. And of course, even as readers everything we know is presented through multiple layers of personal accounts – the creature's, Victor's, Walton's. The ending of *Frankenstein* provokes questions about how far the characters' – and our – decisions are informed by the narratives others tell them and the ones they tell themselves.",sfadow,2017-12-07T06:23:55Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,2

7i0s5p_4,7i0s5p,"In my opinion, Frankenstein is a novel with a very original and interesting central idea, but it's terribly badly written from the point of view of plot structure.

You mention the ending, and I agree it's hugely unsatisfying. The climax consists of the monster giving a long speech which describes in excruciating detail exactly how he's feeling. Then he leaves to kill himself. Nothing actually happens. It might have worked if this had been a logical end of subtle character development, but it's not. It's the first time we've heard him speak or even really seen him act since the murder Elizabeth. His feelings towards his creator just seem to magically reverse moment he learns of his death. 

Of course the shock of hearing of someone's death can change a person's feelings about them. I think most of us are more inclined to see the good parts in a relationship with someone who has died than the bad. That doesn't work in the novel though as there was nothing good in the way Frankenstein treated the monster. He always regarded him as subhuman, never accepted him, never even tried to do his duty by him. I read the final speech by the monster wondering what he could possibly have been talking about when he praised Frankenstein's gentleness and kindness (I think those were the words used). When did Frankenstein ever show those qualities toward him? Why would the death of Frankenstein cause such remorse when killing or causing the deaths of several innocent people had no effect?

There are other problems which come earlier in the book, but I think this is the biggest, and I'm in danger of rambling on here.

Especially after the action ramps up when Frankenstein makes the bride and then destroys her which unleashes the monsters final fury. I think the quick ending is meant to bring things to a conclusion in a way that makes you reflect on everything the monster represented throughout the novel and what ultimately the monster (and Frankenstein) signify in those final moments (which if you recall is being told from the perspective of the ship captain that picked up the dr while in the arctic. This is how the story begins as well.)

k71ccp_3,k71ccp,"While not sure how people responded to the book, she was using real struggles/innovations of the time to put them in a different light 

[source](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/english-literature/the-historical-context-of-frankenstein-english-literature-essay.php)

The monster himself is a symbolism of birth of science—an acquisition of intellectual power beyond the common learning. “At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification (Shelley 112).” This statement of Victor’s creature signifies his extreme power and knowledge beyond human thoughts. During the period of 19th century science emerged as a profession. It becomes one of the distinct points of learning during the said era. It means that Shelley is aware of the capability of science to create different entities. Science is one of the most significant points of the novel because it establishes the conflict of the story. When the monster perceives his face into the mirror, Shelley conveys the authority of science over human existence because it has the power to create abnormal creatures—beyond expectation.

Aside from the birth of science, Shelley also discusses the representation of women in the society within her novel. “At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been (Shelley 185).” This statement of Victor encompasses his guilt towards Justine. He knows that this woman is not the murder—it is his creature, but because of his weak character, he lets Justine suffer. This idea is a depiction of women status in the society. During the period of 19th century when Shelley writes this novel, women have no voice in their culture. They remain as weak, unprivileged, and servants of men. Using the character of Justine as innocent, weak, poor woman, Victor tends to utilize her to surpass his sins. It happens without the knowledge of Justine because she does not know the situation within her midst. Therefore, Justine’s case is a composition of 19th century history wherein women are objects of the society and not treated as individuals.

Shelley’s novel is also a construction of social enlightenment during 19th century civilization. This is what Fred Randel (2003) believes in his article entitled “The Political Geography of Horror in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.” “Victor now resembles the European intellectuals who flirted with or actively promoted radical ideas at home, but were aghast when overseas colonies chose to apply Enlightenment notions of human rights to their own condition (Randel 469).” Randel states that Victor’s character is a signification of social enlightenment through his acts and determination to unleash the secrets of physical life. It means that Victor tries to deconstruct the traditional perspectives of people towards the existence of humans. Shelley uses Victor’s character to encompass the idea of enlightenment towards the birth of science. Since science is also a form of physical and intellectual enlightenment, the novel produces a point of history that talks about the non-traditional structure of civilization.

Lastly, Shelley describes the concept of Marxism in her novel through the structure of Victor’s creature. According to Diana Reese (2006) in her article entitled “A Troubled Legacy: Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and the Inheritance of Human Rights,”

“Victor Frankenstein can hear the justice of the monster’s claim (as an ideal citizen) but cannot grant him the corollary rights of man: the protection of the necessities of his life. In the “series of his being,” as an unfinished citizen, the daemon comes to figure something akin to the “unreal universality” of the rights-bearer in Karl Marx’s analysis of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen.” (Reese 65)

When the monster states his story, Victor perceives the human thoughts of the monster but his physical appearance hinders him to become real human. The concept of Marxism emerges in this point because the creature is called as the “unfinished citizen” due to his appearance. Therefore, he could not obtain the privileges and rights of human beings. This scenario encompasses the history of the society during 19th century wherein people are not equal due to physical appearance. The civilization of this era is degrading as what Shelley is trying to convey because people perceive the beauty and humanness of a person through physical appearance—not by heart, mind, and soul.

In conclusion, it can be said that Frankenstein depicts the historical context of 19th century in different portions—social class, knowledge, and enlightenment. Shelley unleashes the fact that Frankenstein is not just a simple story of horror, but a narration of social issues during the period of 19th century—the period of revolution, knowledge growth, and social awareness. Therefore, history reflects throughout the novel as it unravels the life beyond the conventional.",Nevermoremonkey,2020-12-05T05:00:58Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,3

This is an artists representation (via make up) of how he might have looked like. I think it corresponds to the textual description quite well, though I would've imagined the eyes a bit more watery (probably hard to change that on a living model.)

I always envisioned him looking a bit like a rehydrated mummy, if that makes sense. With the yellow skin, black lips and so on, I'd imagine he does look a bit like a walking dead man. Like his creator tried to choose body parts that fit together reasonably well, hide the scars as well as possible, give him a handsome face, lushious hair...
But as soon as he gets up from the table, you can't shake the feeling that something is wrong about him, just like another poster described. You can sense that this is dead tissue that shouldn't be walking around, yet it does, and it speaks and it looks at you with intelligent eyes. It breaks our perception of what ""should be"" on a level that's even more basic than body parts stitched together.

am0qgh_1,am0qgh,"Just from reading this thread a lot of people don't ""get"" Frankenstein because they're unfamiliar with the narrative structures underpinning it.

It utilises both a frame narrative (Walton recounting Frankenstein, who himself recounts the creature) and an unreliable narrator. Victor's often verbose and melodramatic style is a deliberate attempt to convince Walton of his innocence and to abdicate responsibility for the creature's crimes.

But look closely and you can see Shelley doesn't want us to sympathise with Victor at all. For example, ehile Justine awaits execution for a crime she didn't commit, the narrative at this point revolves entirely around Victor's own sense of dread and fear of the creature. He constantly begs the listener/reader (who remember is Walton, due to the frame narrative) to sympathise with his internal grief and struggle at this stage, while simultaneously making Justine's sacrifice all about him. In short, it is megalomania in action.

Another good example is when the creature is born. ""It held out a hand - seemingly to detain me."" We know from the creature's narrative though that this was a lie - he held his hand out for help, not hindrance.

Overall I think it is absolutely remarkable to think this book was written by a 19 year old girl. It's not perfect - what is? - but it takes on a new lease of life when you read it with an understanding of the narrative structure and how that affects our view of Victor.

The message of the book was really good. Frankenstein's creation and Robert Walton seemed like the most 'human' characters to me but I really did not like the way the rest of the characters were written. 

I don't claim to be an authority on literature or anything but damn. 

Victor Frankenstein was so bloody melodramatic. Everyone was perfect. His father, perfect. Justine, perfect. His cousin Elizabeth, perfect. The kid who died, perfect, his friend Henry, guess what! Fucking perfect! 

Oh and the 'wretch?' yeah he was the worst thing ever. I mean did this guy feel neutral towards anything? Another part that annoyed me is that whenever someone died or something bad happened he just got sick. That's not how it works. What is going on?

Then there was the dialogue. Yes people spoke differently in 1818. Fair enough. Frankenstein's creation spoke for 5 chapters straight. Five! And Frankenstein couldn't get a word in edgeways. I reckon what must have happened was that Frankenstein thought that a well defined jawline made a good looking man and concentrated all his efforts there and neglected everything else rendering the creation ugly, but hey, at least those jaws were able to carry on talking for five fucking chapters.

I so agree with you! The whole frame story with that artic explorer guy rescuing Frankenstein and then pretty much is never heard of again...like wtf was that


""I felt the majority of the cast was repetitive, flat and 2D with exception of Frankenstein and his monster.""

Have you read Dracula? Same fucking deal. So annoying. But yah, I think all the characters (except monster and Frank) were pretty much over used tropes.

Considering Mary Shelley's very (very!) scandalous affair with Percy, which was arguably responsible for the suicide of Percy's first wife Harriet and indirectly linked to another suicide (a half sister of Mary's, I think?), I always thought the monster was either Mary herself or percy. And Frankenstein is...her Dad or society. who knows...

""Wasn't really sure why Frankenstein never told anyone about his creation, or was he too full of pride and/or shame?""

To create the monster, Frankenstein became a grave robber, a desecrator of corpses...a crime in modern times, and most certainly a crime back then, if not a legal one than a moral one. also, the monster looked exactly like what it was, something patched together from the dismembered body parts of corpses. so maybe Frankenstein achieved something amazing scientifically, but his means were so repulsive and violated way too many fundamental human moralities for him to be able to show it off (he felt, I think lol).

Also Frankenstein was behaving in a way that people near to him were assuming he had lost or was losing his mind. remember that he had also been sick for a long time with fever, and fever was associated at that time with delirium etc. The real story of the monster is so incredible that Frankenstein reasons that if he told the truth, then people would believe him mad/crazy. And tbf, he had a point.

"" although i feel it could be written better ""

people like to speculate alternative authorships for Frankenstein because the reasoning goes that such a work of genius could not have possibly been written by a 19 year old girl.

I had a horrible time with the writing style of the time. And I felt it was slow paced. I loved the times  ""Adam"" was part of the story but he was hardly used.  

By the end of the book I wanted to collapse of exhaustion right Along with Victor.

5uy4nb_1,5uy4nb,"When I first read Frankenstein in school, I was resentful as hell that this arrogant man and his creation conspired to create another creature that would live in the same misery as the original creation--only for the bride, it would be her duty and obligation to make life easier for the original. Do either of them even stop to consider what she would want or feel? What if she is happy alone? What if she is disgusted by the monster physically? What if she wants to have children with a man of her own choosing? What if she wants no children and no husband? No book had ever made me so angry. 

Then I realized Mary Shelley was some sort of genius because this is exactly the story of Adam and Eve, here replicated by the man of science. A man of science would make a different choice than God, and would see flawed creation (humans) as a mistake. Thinking about this conundrum (are humans a mistake because they are an imperfect image of their creator), I reread the entire book with a more analytical eye (as a counterpoint to Milton's Paradise Lost). I read up on Mary Shelley's history (her in-/famous mother) and Enlightenment principles upon the social fabric of her times. I considered the subtitle ""The Modern Prometheus"", which points at other myths being explored here.

5uy4nb_5,5uy4nb,"I was raised on old movies, so I saw the majority of the old Universal Frankenstein movies well before I ever read the book.

They are... quite different from the book. The original film with Boris Karloff as the monster is from 1931 and it feels like it. It's an odd experience to watch now if you aren't into old movies. I am into old movies and I found it odd to watch. I think I had my expectations set at a different place than I do when watching most movies from that time just because it was Frankenstein, and because I'd seen a lot of the later Frankenstein films that were of somewhat better quality in terms of filmmaking.

In any case, they make a decent stab at preserving what is the initial innocence of the monster and the way in which his monsterois actions are the result of how he is treated because of his appearance and his having be essentially abandoned in a world he doesn't understand, but the fact that they completely remove the creature's intelligence and make him utterly inarticulate robs it of a lot of the thematic weight of the novel.

The creature comes across as more like a rabid dog that needs to be put down, which is a rather different form of tragedy than the one that exists on the page.

Also, they decided to change Dr Frankenstein's first name to Henry and gave him a best friend named Victor in what feels like a bizarre creative decision that I can only assume was fueled by someone thinking that Victor was too exotic of a name for the leading man of the piece.",Muroid,2017-02-20T05:01:54Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,5
5uy4nb_6,5uy4nb,"Actually, alot of critics called Frankenstein a ""modern Prometheus"", because of how the actions of man go against God. In Paradise Lost, to my knowledge anyway, the tragic hero is often argued to be Satan. Before his fall and permanent transformation into a serpent, he declared to God that angels ought to be self governing and should be regarded as deities. Out of spite, he decided to ruin God's creation, man, to make man suffer for his banishment. The parallels between Frankenstein and Paradise Lost is easily noticed because of their similar motive and narrative structure. Secondly, during the Victorian times where technology was advancing, the idea of putting people out of work and making them suffer as a result is another idea to consider. If a machine takes your place, how can you feed your family or yourself? That's like a form of punishment. 

Now, about Frankenstein's promise to create a mate...That's another argument. Back then, as you already know, women did not have the rights they have now so the idea of what she wants did not occur to Frankenstein and his monster. However, Frankenstein did play with the ideas of what she would do or is capable of doing, which is why he destroyed her in the middle of creation. He did not want another threat to lurk around in the world. The creation of man, humanity itself, is God's design therefore it is deemed natural. Humanity procreating, is natural. Humanity creating life from things that are dead, is unnatural and defy God's design. A human being is not a God, we are not perfect. We have our flaws because, like in Paradise Lost, we were convinced to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. 

This could get into a whole other discussion about the Bible and Paradise Lost but, I think a religious discussion might not be a good idea, considering people of multiple faiths and respecting their viewpoints. What I will say is, I agree that the female monster was not truly thought of but then again, Frankenstein did not think of his monster either when he created him. It was out of sheer ambition, blind ambition. And that blindness led to his demise.",AlbireoTai18,2017-02-19T18:19:51Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,6
5uy4nb_7,5uy4nb,"Frankenstein was arrogant and created the monster out of sheer obsession. He had tunnel vision and he literally spent days without sleep just to work on his creation. Now, breaking the promise and the consequences that come afterwards make sense. ""Oh, you don't want me to have a mate but you get to? Screw you, she dies and you'll feel my loneliness. "" That was the monster's mentality. But, after killing an innocent child William, framing an innocent woman who was loved by the community, killed Clerval and then killing Elizabeth, they did nothing to the monster. This was pure vengeance. And it took Frankenstein's death for the monster to realize his mistakes. Also, he deliberately made Frankenstein endure a hell that nobody deserves just for a sick game of cat and mouse. 

Like you said, nobody but God should create life. Not because of religious reasons, but because creating life from death is an unnatural phenomenon and rejects the laws of nature. And this is something I thought of while reading the story, Frankenstein is an amalgamation of dead body parts, he can't really have kids because his parts are essentially dead. Same case would be for his would be bride. I could be wrong in that regard but, Frankenstein's idea of the monster procreating and spreading this undead curse, I think it's a bit of a stretch.",AlbireoTai18,2017-02-19T14:27:12Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,7

I'm assuming the writer or writers of the script were having a bit of fun with the source material. As for the monster himself, making him into a dimwit who caused trouble probably made it easier in terms of production. The novel builds up both Victor Frankenstein and the monster quite well but over time and through alot of dialogue. By cutting out alot of dialogue, which was necessary for the monster to describe his side of the story, you get just a horror film for that year. 

Someone mentioned in the thread earlier about a show called Penny Dreadful and how they portray the various characters in classic literature like Frankenstein.

5uy4nb_11,5uy4nb,"My point exactly: it's a layered text. 

You can approach it in various directions from Milton's text (Victor is like Milton's Satan, thinking he should have the abilities reserved for God, or the creature is like Milton's Satan, as the creature revenges himself upon his maker and ruins his endeavors), or from the story of Prometheus (Victor steals the power/might/knowledge of the gods), or from Plato's Theory of Forms. You can examine the theme of technology displacing man's work, the theme of knowledge/education, the place and role of women and motherhood (*conspicuous here by its lack--you suggest that this is overlooked on the author's part; well, it's certainly not treated explicitly, but it is the subtext of the work, IMO; Victor is also cutting out the mother from the procreation equation, refuses to share in creation by producing a child in the regular way. He refuses to build a female creature who can ""create"" others, too*), etc. You can get a lot out of the book, but only if you don't sucker yourself into thinking it's just a horror story, meant to entertain and not reflect upon its time. Lots of people, when they pick up the book, think they know what they're going to be getting into (the first SF-horror novel, similar to the popular idea of Frankenstein as the monster itself, complete with bolts and stitches) and have no idea of the profundity of the work. Even more challenging for some, really enjoying the novel requires active, not passive, reading.

(And...Personally, I believe you cannot discuss Frankenstein without discussing Adam and Eve. EDIT: Your comment about the female creature being overlooked is not actually my point at all. I don't think we are really encouraged to ignore the problem as readers. That was simply my first and less analytical response to the work, since you asked in OP.

5uy4nb_13,5uy4nb,"I watched the first episode of that, actually, but I think the creature only got flashed on screen briefly at the end of that (assuming I'm remebering correctly), so I don't really have a point of reference for his portrayal on the show.

The old Universal version ranges from a tragic simpleton to a walking MacGuffin with even less of a personality than as initially portrayed. In thinking about it now, I find it interesting that he is not usually portrayed in the typical fashion of horror. 

Most horror that has a monsters plays on the audience or characters not knowing what is lurking in the shadows or where or when the monster will strike. Thr story is told from the perspective of the heroes or victims with the monster being shrouded in mystery.

Frankenstein's monster is always never portrayed in this fashion. It doesn't strike and recede off-screen as a lurking presence. It's more like a roving natural disaster with damage done being either accidental or often provoked by the victims in some way.

The reason I find this interesting is that, at least by the later part of the novel, the creature really fits the template of a traditional movie monster in the way he hovers as a malevolent force at the edges of Victor Frankenstein's life than the actual movie incarnation does.

5uy4nb_14,5uy4nb,"I agree with you, Frankenstein is a layered text and can be interpreted in multiple ways, which is why it's such a fantastic read. When something is complex and has ideas for a reader to dissect and draw parallels, it opens the scope of what the encoded message in the story is. As for the female monster, I didn't think too much into it because Frankenstein had a reason for not going through with creating a female monster. You do have a point though, he's essentially eliminating the woman from the procreation, I did not really think of this idea until you pointed it out to me. 

Since Frankenstein is eliminating the mother from the procreation equation, as you said previously, then where does that leave the humanity in the monster? In my interpretation, since the monster and his would be bride would've been made out of dead flesh, they can't procreate anyway because they are sterile. However, under the supposition that they CAN procreate, then having the woman is a necessity. Although, when put into that context, it seems that all a woman is supposed to do is have children. On both sides, Frankenstein promising to make her out of fear and self interest and the monster's base desire for a companion, are selfish ideals. Even destroying the woman is, in itself, selfish. That selfishness is a shared flaw between creator and the created. ",AlbireoTai18,2017-02-20T00:16:31Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,14

How reliable are these narrators?

This is one of my favourite aspects. It brings another layer to the question of who is really the monster, or monsters. Each of those narrators could have so many motives for telling the story the way they do. I think people think they know the book from the film depictions of *Frankenstein* plus the well-known 'Frankstein isn't the name of the monster but Frankenstein is the monster' piece of wisdom, but I found that when I read it there was far more than one monster in *Frankenstein*.",satanspanties,2018-08-03T17:56:47Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,3

Frankenstein is like a deep dive into very important topics, but Wilde doesn't really work that way. I always saw him as professing to value form over substance so that we don't realize that we're reading something that stays with us (or, at least, with me). Frankenstein, I think, deals with something innately human directly, but Dorian Gray wraps its central horror in so many layers that it doesn't seem as visceral.

Dorian Gray, meanwhile, while it certainly isn't lacking in depth or good characters, doesn't even approach Frankenstein. Also it seems to have some unnecessary stuff in it, like... a lot of Lord Henry's dialogue (Wilde is a master of witty quotes and it's clear he used Henry as a conduit to express that, but it doesn't really lend Henry's conversations towards being as succinct and on-topic as the plot of the book).

7abuto_1,7abuto,"1. Be careful about mixing 'Frankenstein' and 'Frankenstein's Monster' when you're under pressure.  But yes, there is a very solid 'the monster was us all along' sub plot to the whole thing.

2.  As for Shelley, she basically invented science fiction.  The 'life from death' bit has been a staple for a long time, nothing new there, but what was prompting Shelley was the new (ish) science of electricity, which was promising to change everything in strange and poorly understood ways.  Galvinism, in particular, was a hot topic. The 'dancing frog's legs' had already taken the world by storm, even though it never truly performed a resurrection.

So like any good sci fi writer, she was channeling the thinly understood miracle tech of her time through the lens of an old story - remember it is sub-titled 'Modern Prometheus' so there are call backs to classical mythology.

3.  You don't feel remorse until after you've done the evil. Everything else the monster experienced was in relation to his relationship with his creator.  It drove him to continue.  Surrender doesn't come until that relationship has reached its conclusion. ",malwayslooking,2017-11-02T14:41:12Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1
7abuto_2,7abuto,"I think this is fairly good for a high school analysis. Here is some more background for you:

1. *Frankenstein* is largely considered the first horror sci-fi novel ever written. It was designed to be frightening, yes, but scary in the sense that we're frightened for the future of humanity. malwayslooking's ""The monster was us all along"" is a good summation of this theme. Shelley plays with this theme a lot in her other works, as well, and it became a staple of sci-fi literature later on down the road. 

2. Look up the story of Prometheus, as that will help you understand many of Frankenstein's underlying themes. Wikipedia should be adequate for this. It's an interesting read.

3. ""Protagonist"" doesn't necessarily have to mean ""good guy."" Think Patrick Bateman from *American Psycho.* We follow the character and his thought processes throughout the entire novel (or movie) even though he's a terrible guy. Victor Frankenstein has good intentions in the beginning, but he tries to play God and ends up creating something that he is both frightened and ashamed of. This isn't necessary for your analysis, but I would encourage you to look more closely at the relationships Victor has with female characters throughout the novel, specifically Elizabeth and the creature's female mate.

4. I'll admit, it's been a long time since I last read *Frankenstein,* so I'm not sure that I could give the best answer to your final question. If I'm wrong, I'd like it if some other user could correct me. Without Victor, the creature no longer had a purpose. He had no one left to create a mate for him, no one left to hunt down and torment except himself. The creature hated Victor for bringing him into the world and then shunning him, but he also felt attached to him like a son would feel toward his father. ""The sins of the father"" theme is prevalent in this novel as well. You could give that a google. Without a mate, and without Victor, there was nothing for the creature to do except kill himself. No one else in the world would ever accept him, and no one would be around to explain what he even was.

I hope this makes more sense to you now.",OFGhost,2017-11-02T15:41:11Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,2
7abuto_3,7abuto,"First, ""Frankenstein"" should be used to reference Victor Frankenstein. Victor's creation is generally referred to as ""The Creature,"" not the monster. Calling him ""The Monster"" implies that he is evil, which he is not. What you might ask yourself is, who is the real ""monster"" in this novel? Also, in general, Christian theologists view evil as one of God's creations. Thus there is nothing that is evil, only good corrupted.

Second, what is Victor's responsibility to his creation? In Christianity, God imparts knowledge and rules to his people via the prophets. Does Victor do this for his creation? Remember, Mary Shelley was not a scientist, so the science part of the novel is intentionally vague. Victor's ""science"" borders on magic or alchemy. This is made clear by Victor's reverence for Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa.

Lastly, I'm not sure the creature feels remorse. Remember, the creature tells Victor that there was no one to teach him how to live his life. The creature had to learn about society by observation. The creature's spiritual views are formed by reading Milton's Paradise Lost, which he views as history, rather than fiction. 

One thing I would like to add is Victor's fear of the creature from a masculine standpoint. There is a kind of sibling rivalry that happens between Victor and his creation, some would argue that a Zeus/Cronos analogy is more appropriate, but consider that the creature robs Victor of his wedding night. Thus stopping Victor from consummating his marriage. The creature is physically superior to Victor and, in some ways, intellectually superior. I would suggest checking out Blade Runner, as it offers a modern analogy to the Frankenstein story.

In the end, what is Victor's responsibility to his creation? What is our responsibility to our creations? Should science do or create things because they are able to? Does that fact that the creature is self-aware, change the narrative? So many questions generated by this 200 year-old novel. Good luck on your test.

7abuto_5,7abuto,"One thing: I think you should be careful to avoid labelling characters as 'good' or 'bad'. We all have a capacity for doing good and bad things and a perceptive writer (like Mary Shelley) will depict that through ambiguous characterisation. 

As for point 1) and the question of the monster's morality, I think you could mention the strong allusions to Milton's **Paradise Lost** throughout the text. Some of the epigraphs are direct quotes and throughout the text itself there are references to PL. Basically, Victor Frankenstein assumes the role of God/Creator, and the monster, his unwilling creation, is Adam. This complicates the idea that the monster is purely evil. He is an unnatural creation, meaning he is doomed from birth. He isn't entirely blameless, but he is a result of overreaching human curiosity and arrogance. We have to ask to what degree Victor Frankenstein's actions are immoral. He is indirectly responsible for multiple murders, but does he feel guilt or does he lay all the blame on his monster? 

Good luck on your test!

dy5oof_1,dy5oof,"I re-read the book this autumn, and I found myself relating to Frankenstein a lot more than I did when I read it in high school. On your third point, I think he went crazy before he met eyes with his creation, probably during the period of isolation when he was fervently working on the creature, collecting body parts, living in his mind while ignoring thoughts of potential negative consequences, and thoroughly neglecting all other parts of himself not devoted to his project. I had more sympathy for him this time around, because it is such human folly to deceive oneself to achieve aims. 
And yeah, on your last point, I could not get behind Frankenstein’s self-absorption. He really seemed to enjoy his Creator role too much to share his experience with the people around him and to accept that the creature could form associations and affect things beyond him (until it’s too late).

gcawp6_1,gcawp6,"I loved this book as well! From a scientific perspective (and also from what little I understand of the evolution of scientific theory), I find The Enlightenment fascinating. It was the childhood of science - there was both enthusiasm, but so little was really known (perhaps outside of math and some astronomy) that the imagination wasn't bound by the limits we have since discovered about the natural world.

>But, to that extent was his folly, and I found myself trying to really understand the evil Victor had caused to deserve his misery.

Well, you asked us not to come at you with sympathy for the demon, so I'll try to avoid doing that. But ultimately Victor's sin is that he is weak-willed and a coward. It ties in a bit with your question below, so I'll start my general rambling there:

>And, why not tell his father, or Henry, or Elizabeth of his ""creation""?

Victor was ashamed. In the book, he glosses over exactly how he animated the demon, describing it along the lines of being too dreadful for thought (although it does make me wonder where the trope of animating the demon with lightening/electricity comes from). Even in our day and age, what he did would be considered incredibly perverse. Taking peoples' bodies and hacking them together to try to create a superhuman? Plus, the general religious stigma of trying to play God. Victor shows cowardice at every turn where it would have mattered most: he animates the demon, and then immediately runs off. When he discovers the demon has escaped, he just kind of flails about, never attempting to figure out where his creation went, until he gets a letter telling him to come home ASAP. When he gets home, it's obvious that Frankenstein has killed his brother, but he lets the nanny hang for it rather than telling anyone his story. He says 'yes' to the creature when asked to create a bride for him, then later changes his mind. Instead of risking his wedding plans by telling his family that there's a psychotic madman on the loose trying to kill everyone close to him, Victor goes through all the motions of getting married, sticks to the plan so that no one knows something is wrong and, quelle suprise, Elizabeth is murdered.

It isn't until after his father's death that Victor finds the strength of character to deal with the problem that he has created, and that is only after the problem he created took absolutely everything from him. In this, both Victor and the demon are mirrored: Victor's secrecy around his creation begins the process of isolating him, begins the process of making him just as lonely as his creation. The demon is lonely and isolated because he is too hideous to be looked upon, no one would accept him into their society. Victor is lonely and isolated because of the condition of his soul - playing God and unleashing a psychotic demon on the world has made his soul as twisted and ugly as the demon. Ironically, they are a perfect pair for each other by the end of the book - both twisted, ugly beings, full of hatred and murderous revenge.

And if Im not mistaken, Universal owns the concept that many Americans view of Frankenstein (like the flat top head, giant stature, scarred face, bolts on neck). So if someone does an interpretation of Shelley's Frankenstein (even though it's in the public domain), Universal can  step in if their version resembles the iconic Frankenstein Universal Monster from the 20s or 30s (which did very well back in its day!). Why don't other companies do their versions of cinderella and sleeping beauty since those are in the public domain?

7r0u54_3,7r0u54,"I haven't read the original, but I've recently read ""Romantic Outlaws"" by Charlotte Gordon and she does talk about the differences between the first edition and the second one. This is what she had to say about it:

>Most important, Bentley’s Standard Novel series offered Mary a place on its list for Frankenstein if she revised it so that Bentley could own the copyright.


> Mary was happy for the opportunity to rethink her first novel. Far from becoming more conventional after Shelley died, as Trelawny and Claire had claimed, she had grown increasingly disillusioned with the hypocrisy she witnessed in daily life. When she sat down at her writing desk, she applied herself to painting an even bleaker picture than in the original, making changes that emphasized her darkened outlook. In her first version, Victor Frankenstein has the freedom to choose whether to pursue his ambition to create a man. When he makes the wrong choice, it is his own action that brings about his downfall; like a character in a Sophoclean drama, his actions determine his future. But in the 1831 version, Mary strips him of any agency. Victor is a puppet in the hands of inexorable forces, both inner and outer, a man who must obey his impulses and is helpless in the hands of the fates. She lengthens Walton’s letters to his sister, having Frankenstein redouble his warnings against ambition: “Unhappy man! Do you share my madness?” Frankenstein says to Walton, “Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me,—let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!” Elizabeth, Frankenstein’s bride, who was no paragon of strength in the first edition, is now even more powerless, silent and weak, reflecting Mary’s pessimism about women’s chances for happiness when they are dependent on men.

> By the time she had finished, Mary had written a new Frankenstein that was far more critical of society than the first. The 1831 edition depicts the harm caused by human (male) ambition and the lust for power. The female characters may lack the ability to save themselves or others, but they are entirely innocent. They suffer solely because they are connected to Frankenstein. For those naysayers who believed that Percy Shelley was responsible for the writing of the first version, and for those, such as Trelawny and Claire, who accused Mary of being a timid compromiser, the 1831 Frankenstein stands as a supremely original accomplishment, a dystopian vision created entirely by its author, Mary Shelley. Without Shelley by her side, Mary had been forced to become increasingly independent, and, in becoming so, she was now able to write a more complex and powerful book than when she was nineteen years old and her beloved was still alive.

As you see, Gordon doesn't mention the fact it was heavily edited by Shelley's male contemporaries, but considering the fact people kept accusing her of not having written Frankenstein at all, it wouldn't surprise me if the supposed external influence in this was made up as well. I mean, she was basically a kid when she wrote the first version of Frankenstein, and anybody who's ever written something knows how cringe-worthy it is to look back at a  crystallized version of your thoughts that hasn't caught up with how your life changed you; so it makes sense to me that she could want to update the story girl!Mary wrote to catch up with the (many and heartbreaking) experiences woman!Mary had had.

gr5lth_1,gr5lth,"You have to consider how people felt about science at the time. The conflict between science and religion is still going on, and at the time there was plenty of public anxiety surrounding it. Victor Frankenstein is a man who is trying to use science to usurp the role of God. As you probably already know, the application of electricity to dead bodies was at the time creating an idea that people might be able to be brought back from the dead. People didn't understand why dead bodies moved when a current was applied. 

So, compare Frankenstein with Michaelango's  *The Creation of Adam*. Adam is just about to receive the spark of life from God. Before that happens, Adam sits docile and passive. It is only after receiving that spark of life that he becomes human. 

In Frankenstein, the opposite happens. When the monster is brought to life through this new scientific spark of life (electricity) from his own creator, he becomes something terrible instead of something divine. Frankenstein instantly understands that he has created something that goes against nature. Victor was prepared for how the creature would look. As you said, he collects the parts and puts them together. But until he gave that spark of life, he didn't know what he was going to create. It is only when science has gone too far that you realise it has gone too far.",,2020-05-27T00:29:57Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1

q3z2xj_1,q3z2xj,"Okay, so this is my fourth or fifth time reading Frankenstein, but it's been about a decade since the last read. Something that's really sticking out to me this time is how prevalent the theme of parental abandonment is and how common an occurrence it is within the story's early stages, particularly these chapters.

Walton, from the start, in his notes to Margaret, claims to want friendship, someone to share in his ambitions, successes and defeats. Yet, when he describes the ideal friend he seeks he specifies he wants someone with higher education, more means and experience than himself. Given the dejection of his father - forbidding him to read his uncle Thomas's books on seafaring - and this description he's clearly looking for more of a father figure than a peer, at least that's how it seems to me.

This echoes Victor's own familial lack. In fact, so much of the novel's characters' backstories detail parental dejection and absence. Robert, Victor, Elizabeth, who was callously pawned off by her father to her aunt and uncle after her mother's death; Victor's mother whose father died, and Justine, too - the lack or rejection of parental figures forces them to become autodidactic/self-taught in their youth - perhaps grimly shading their formative years (particularly Victor and Robert, here) and allowing their growth into adulthood to be clouded by insufficient or misguided education, leading each to their ultimate failure. Not just the failure of their ambitious quests for scientific glory, but their failure to notice that their parents' lack and the emotional needs they feel are absent are already filled by their existing familial relationships, namely Margaret, Waltons sister, and Elizabeth and Henry Clerval for Victor.  Victor clearly passes this on with his immediate abandonment of ""the daemon"" who in turn follows the exact same path - inadequate self-education leading to rushed judgment and failures to connect to the society at large.

It's certainly interesting that Mary Shelley tapped into some of these generational traits, possibly due to being still a teenager when writing this and having strong opinions on class systems that she sort of satirizes a little bit in *Frankenstein*. I'm so happy and excited to dig into this book again and discuss it.

Also, fun note, I'm reading from *Frankenstein: Annotated for Scientists, Engineers, and Creators of all Kinds.* I have a physical copy but wouldn't you know it, open-access library has a [full pdf version](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/24cb1da5-a512-4de1-b24c-639b6452dbec/628778.pdf) online. It's incredibly insightful.

Ah, questions, didn't see those at first. 

>What are some of your favorite parts or quotes? What parts did you find confusing or wish were different?

""M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.  
Clerval was no natural philosopher. His imagination was too vivid for the minutiæ of science.""

I find it insightful in his recounting to Walton just how dismissive Victor is. It's his major blind spot throughout the story. 

Also, I really love Shelley's description of the thunderstorm over the mountains when he returns to Geneva in the early, early morning, and the passing glimpse of the creature in the flashes.

&#x200B;

>What, in your opinion, is the nature of the origin of horror in the novel? What is your relationship to the horror genre (especially gothic) and your familiarity with Classics?

Some familiarity with classics - Shelley's *The Last Man*, *Crime and Punishment*, *Portrait of Dorian Gray*, *Dracula,* etc, but not a vast knowledge.

I think the horror in *Frankenstein* comes in the realization of trauma. The monster, for Victor, fully realizes his traumas and obsessions in physical form and the trauma emerges from his own anxieties and his own search for a mentor, filling the gap that his parents seemed to leave. It exposes to Victor - violently - that perhaps Victor abandoned his parents rather than the opposite.   


>How necessary were the conditions that lead Shelley to create her story? Could another author, even a contemporary writer, have penned a similar tale?

I think Shelley's youth and liberalism led her to view aristocracies at the time a certain way. I don't know much/can't recall much about her, but I know a tenuous relationship with her mother could clearly lead to Victor's characterization in the novel. I think another writer could hit the same plot beats, but miss the heart of the novel. I think the countless poor adaptations of the novel are a sign of that.

&#x200B;

>Why do you feel the novel unfolds in letters and nested tales? How do these devices affect the themes and central terror?

I think you need unreliable narrators in a story like this. You catch more character glimpses with that. A footnote in the edition I've read points out that Victor makes no mention of taking notes while ""creating"" the monster for posterity or publication. You get a window into the obsession and the paranoia that unfolds in the chase between Victor and the monster, or the developing relationship between Walton and Victor express what happens at the bounds of the known world - which is a terrifying place to be. The horror is clear - what do you do when you find the unknown? *Create* the unknown? 

&#x200B;

>What role do sickness and dreams play for Shelley and her characters? Do you feel these elements service the style of the novel or feed the exploration of existential dread and ambition?

Dreams seem to act like Freudian hints to the characters' anxieties. That Victor is open to sharing his dreams with Walton shows his development as a character and his understanding of his mistakes, but also expresses his acceptance of damnation. He is doomed, and he knows it.   


>BONUS: which song, album, or musical artist would be a good accompaniment for the reading thus far?

Tool. I think Tool has a unique way of not only discussing similar themes of anxieties, progress, mysticism, science into one package, but the music itself is also both violent and contemplative in turns. *Pneuma* is about the spark and breaths of life, *Forty-Six & 2* discusses many of the same anxieties that obsessively drive Victor

All three narrators - Walton, Frankenstein and his monster - commit illegal, immoral or questionable acts. How they justify that fascinates me. It's a novel you have to read with a critical mind.

This is best summed up for me in how Frankenstein first describes seeing his creation move:

""He stretched out one hand, seemingly to detain me""

That one word ""seemingly"" is so telling, because in the Monster's narrative he stretches out his hand for help, not hindrance.

This may sound a little morbid but I liked the letter that Victor received from his father. I was so engaged in Victor's life and studies that after his sickness I mostly forgot that it was a gothic horror novel we were reading. It was such a twist and gut wrenching it really had an effect on me. 
A quote that I like is in chapter ch (pg 31 in my kindle ed) ""A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.""



**What, in your opinion, is the nature of the origin of horror in the novel? What is your relationship to the horror genre (especially gothic) and your familiarity with Classics?**


I've only read two other horror classics: The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Haunting of Hill House. This is my first reading of Frankenstein. 

With the Picture of Dorian Gray >!I felt like the horror came from Dorian not knowing of the atrocities he was cable of doing. Like a self vs self conflict. And with The Haunting of Hill House instead of the typical haunted house it was more of questioning reality. Was Eleanor really not able to handle the creepy things happening to her and the other guests and did she really lose her mind in the house or did the house really drive her to her demise?!< 

I feel like Frankenstein might go about something similar as in what we see is not really the whole story. So far as an audience we may believe that Frankenstein's monster did commit the murder of William. But what if it was Justine and if not Justine maybe another human. It would be hard to admit that humans are capable of such atrocities when there is a literal monster whom we can easily assign the blame to. 
I not sure exactly how to put into words what I think horror classes nature is but I my best guess is that it puts more emphasis on psychological horror than things that jump out you from the dark. 



**How necessary were the conditions that lead Shelley to create her story? Could another author, even a contemporary writer, have penned a similar tale?**


I actually no little to nothing about Mary Shelley or the conditions that lead to her creating the novel so I can't really answer this. 



**Why do you feel the novel unfolds in letters and nested tales? How do these devices affect the themes and central terror?**
I love the letters and then later on the tales from Victor. It's kinda of like a game of telephone. It's like it messes with the reliability of the narrator and we don't know how ""true"" the events are which leads to a little doubt and increases the horror. 



**What roll do sickness and dreams play for Shelley and her characters? Do you feel these elements service the style of the novel or feed the exploration of existential dread and ambition?**


I think that the dreams force Victor to come to terms that he may have screwed up by letting his creation get away and now is doomed to suffer any and all consequences from that mistake. It think he's doomed to suffer. 



**What questions or predictions do you have moving forward and what do you hope to see? Is there a question you would like to posted to the group for next week?**

I really don't want Frankenstein's ""monster"" to be responsible for William's death. And that being said I hope that we as an audience come to sympathize with Frankenstein's creation because the poor thing didn't ask to be part of this world and he was just left alone to fend for himself in a scary world were even his own creator thinks he's a monster.

q3z2xj_5,q3z2xj,"This is my second reading, and I was pretty excited about digging a bit deeper into the text now that I knew the adaptation-divorced plot and characters from the first a few years ago.

These are some random notes I took while reading this first section, so they’re not aligned to the questions really, but they hit some of the points:

- The richness of the language is still challenging, but can also be so satisfying. Indulgence is no sin.

- I still don’t know how to feel about the relationship between Victor and Elizabeth. Is it supposed to be a genuine romantic ideal? There’s no denying that there’s tenderness there. But even beyond the (modern?) weirdness of going from such a strong sibling relationship to a romantic one, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that the way Victor talks possessively of her in Chapter 1 could be either parallel or foreshadowing of his relationship with the creature, and also a bit of feminist critique on Shelley’s part on the possessively-termed gender roles of the times.

- One thing most adaptations fail in is reminding us that Victor is no more than twenty or twenty-one at the time of the experiment. That’s a far cry in terms of characterizing and judging him, and the themes of his character and the novel, from picturing him as a white-haired professor. I wish that in art and on screen he was more often shown as, essentially, a boy. It would paint a different picture in culture.

- Frankenstein the book and the character are rarely talked about in regards to mental health but Frankie’s breakdown following the creation seems an unusually sympathetic portrayal of trauma for the time. Shelley takes some care to show a genuine seeming recovery, with Clerval’s companionship and Viccy finding purpose in nature balancing out the time it takes to recover, and the very genuine assessment of science equipment as a trigger. On that point, isn’t Clerval a treasure? “Excellent friend!” (exclaimed by Victor towards the end of Chapter 6) about sums it up. This in contrast to the creation, who in his abandonment, is never allowed that healing companionship.

- Shelley seems very fond of (a) Switzerland and (b) Asian literature. I like the bit about Victor being healed by reading poetry that “appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses.”  It’s also a lovely upswing of humanizing, in a section that feels just the same way, against the gothic tide of the novel overall. On the Switzerland point it’s interesting thinking of this fairly progressive English lady spending time in one of the first European republics (I’m a little fuzzy on that history, but in Frankenstein she basically says as much) and coming to idealize it out of a combination of insight and probably some nostalgia.

For the music question, often when I hear [Secret of Life by Lord Huron](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2W_STsqV1tc) I think of Frankenstein. The lyrics and the gothic feel of it.",Exploding_Antelope,2021-10-08T18:38:20Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,5
q3z2xj_6,q3z2xj,"I’m not really a horror person, so I tend to avoid books that are billed as “horror” due to the strong associations I have between the term and supernatural horror or slasher movies. As for classics, I read a bunch in high school and undergrad, but I read more new releases these days and really only read classics when I go out of my way to read a specific book or author.

I think the environs of Lake Geneva and fellow writers, the time in which it was written, plus Mary Shelley’s own life events, helped bring together this story and make it an enduring tale. Another writer today could write a similar story, sure, but I think it would be difficult to create one on the genre-defining level of Frankenstein. Similarly, another writer at the same time could have written a similar story, but the physical environment and the influence of Percy Shelley and Byron made Frankenstein unique. And at the end of the day, no one else is Mary Shelley and no one else would have been able to do exactly what she did.

_x000D_  
I do like a good frame story, and the letters and storytelling framing of the story create a campfire-y feel, like when you’re a kid at camp and everyone’s telling the scariest ghost stories they can think of so you’ll all spend a sleepless night huddled terrified in your tents. It places the story at a remove, being related secondhand by the narrator rather than firsthand. Secondhand and thirdhand and etc-hand scary stories are always embellished a bit with each telling, but they also happened to your best friend’s neighbor’s cousin’s sister, so there has to be some grain of truth, and that’s what makes them scary. Maybe Victor is exaggerating his tale a bit, or Captain Walton hasn’t remembered all the details correctly, but it’s told so vividly that you feel that you could, like Victor, wake up to the creature standing over your own bed.",carolina_on_my_mind,2021-10-12T22:42:43Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,6

The book ends I seem to recall with Walton planning to return to England, but we never read of his homecoming.

45z93l_1,45z93l,"As was said, Victor's biggest sin is creating the monster. The monster didn't asked to be born and Victor shirked his responsibility. In this I don't think the monster gets praise as much as it gets sympathy. 

The monster is the neglected child that, well, grew up to be a monster. Does the monster still bear responsibility for its actions? absolutely, but Victor from F is the deadbeat dad who was not ready to be a father and ran away when faced with consequence. Remember in the time the book was written, the modern ideas of what is science, and what are science's responsibilities were being codified. The book calls itself The Modern Prometheus, but more accurately, in the context of its own story, it's a modern Pandora. In this, the whole story can be seen as a giant metaphor for the scientist and his/her work. Regardless of if he could, Victor didn't really question if he should. Pandora's box was opened and Frankenstein PhD was humbled by the ramifications.

From this heuristic, for myself, I will never blame the monster because I see the monster as a consequence to bad science first and an autonomous being second. When Oppenheimer built the bomb, he took it upon himself to call for nuclear proliferation and heavily criticized the arms race; a potion which would see him stripped of his political influence. Were the bomb built by Frankenstein, the good doctor would have left it to the politicians to figures and his only internal conflict would be whether he should claim any responsibility, or wash his hands of all things and let Serber be credited/blamed for his work.

qdlspv_1,qdlspv,"**What are some of your favorite parts or quotes? What parts did you find confusing or wish were different?**

This was so depressing it's hard to say that I had a favorite part. Through all this the monster still just wants companionship. Even though he thinks himself a monster he still believes that he deserves companionship... ""yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am quite alone."" I think this makes the monster very human to desire companionship. And with his creator gone he is not only missing compainonship but also meaning. 


**How do you feel Frankenstein's understanding of free will changes over the course of his life and his studies? How does he apply this estimation to his own actions, to that of his creation, and to the potential mate for his creation that he ultimately refused to animate?**

I think by the second half of novel Frankenstein believes life to be somewhat predetermined, otherwise why would he be so adamant in thinking that his creation would end up a monster. He already sees his creation as a monster before he commits any crimes and only sees him more so as a monster as time goes on. 


**What morals do you feel Shelley wished to impart on her audience with this tale? For what purpose do you feel the novel was made to include the subtitle ""Or the Modern Prometheus?""**

I'm pretty rusty with my Greek history and Greek mythology but I really don't see the connection with Prometheus and Frankenstein. Promethus stole fire from Olympus for mankind and was punished by Zeus because of it. But I honestly don't see how that connects to this.

That being said I think that Shelley wanted to show her audience that we create monsters with our actions. Kind of like a nature vs nurture. Yes Frankenstein's creation looked like a monster but he didn't start committing monstrous acts until mankind abandon him. Of course he was going to retaliate. He was lonely and never given
love. Love and human touch is vital during the infancy age of humans. If you neglect a baby it could very well die. Who's to say that humankind didn't kill monster's affection, kindness, his desire to love?


**Why are Frankenstein and his monster both ultimately miserable, bereft of human companionship, and obsessed with revenge? In what ways are their respective demises similar or different?**

Frankenstein was an idiot. He suffered exactly what his creation suffered through yet he could not sympathize or empathize with his creation. In the end they both desired the same thing companionship and happiness but vengeance and revenge robbed them of that happiness.


**Why do you feel Walton abandoned his journey in the end and how are his purported or true motivations revealed 
to his sister and to the audience?**

I've honestly forgotten what was Walton's whole purpose in his journey. I did like the fact that Frankenstein 
tried to convince the crew to continue on with the journey.


**What further reading, by Shelley or another author, would you recommend to someone who loved this novel and wants more?**

e7d6qj_2,e7d6qj,"Glad I was able to interest you enough to send you down a rabbit hole! 

It's the same, but it isn't. It's little details, like for example, Victor Frankenstein creates the monster in an act of free will in 1818, he does so because he wants to, despite the consequences of it. He only regrets it once he's done bringing the monster to life. In this way, the monster was the result of an act of strange coincidences and Victor's own desires, the monster becomes human becuase there's not much of a reason for him to exist, yet unexplainably he does. It's shitty luck, and God is absent through the entire novel, just like he's absent of our lives. In the 1831 version, Victor becomes the victim of strange forces of evil, and despite this not being the monster's fault, it still implies his existence as the result of evil, as if he was brought to life because of the devil, and not because of...the chaotic forces that drive our lives. It's basically Shelley herself being the monster who killed her own mother at birth and remains motherless for the rest of her life, in a chaotic way, in a humanly shitty way. Or her being the victim, just like Victor, of destiny, of evil forces. It's almost a religious interpretation of her own tale. Was Victor to be blamed for the monster? Of course not, it was destiny! He's still human in the 1831... but diferent. From a text I found online about the topic:

Anne K. Mellor’s “Choosing a Text of Frankenstein to Teach” is reprinted in the Norton Critical Edition. Mellor reckons that “Mary Shelley’s philosophical views changed radically” primarily as a result of the pessimism created by her own personal circumstances and the deaths of those close to her. “The values implicitly espoused in the first edition of Frankenstein—that nature is a nurturing and benevolent life force that punished only those who transgress against its sacred rights, that Victor is morally responsible for his acts, that the Creature is potentially good but driven to evil by social and parental neglect, that a family like the De Laceys that loves all its children equally offers the best hope for human happiness, and that human egotism causes the greatest suffering in the world—are all rejects in the 1831 revisions” (209).

In 1818, Mellor notes, Victor Frankenstein possessed free will; in 1831 he is the pawn of forces beyond his control. He is a victim rather than an originator of evil; and the morally superior Clerval has in 1831 become someone as ambitious of fame and power as Frankenstein. The idea of the bourgeois loving family is undercut in 1831: Caroline Beaufort deliberately sacrifices her life. And in the preface “Mary Shelley presents herself as she now represents Frankenstein, as a victim of destiny. She is ‘compelled’ to write; her imagination ‘unbidden’ possessed and guided her” (210).

7siy8t_2,7siy8t,"A recent Bodleian edition of the book was profiled in the Chronicle of Higher Education (EBSCO source at bottom). Apparently the question of proper authorial attribution has at times been considered a relevant question by scholars because of Percy’s “interventions,” but this is not heavily indulged by scholars today.

From the article: “To prepare it, Robinson [the editor] returned to the Notebooks and stripped Percy out of the text altogether, leaving the reader alone with Mary's voice. Robinson also included the text of the 1816-17 draft, with Percy's edits clearly marked. The juxtaposition gives us a closer look at the creative give-and-take - word by word, sentence by sentence - of the Shelleys' relationship.”

Percy’s efforts to aid Mary: “Robinson picks out some suggestive examples that contrast Mary's taste for direct language with Percy's penchant for Latinate elaborations. Mary describes a character entering a sick room before ""it was safe""; Percy revises that to ""before the danger of infection was past."" Walton, the ship's captain to whom Frankenstein tells his hair-raising tale, calls a reverie of Victor's ""peculiarly interresting"" [sic] in Mary's draft; Percy changes that to ""almost as interesting & imposing as truth."" Victor's lament that ""the brightness of a loved eye can have faded"" becomes, in Percy's words, ""the brightness of a loved eye can be extinguished.""” (I’m too lazy to edit the double quotations marks to contained singles)

Quantifying Percy’s “interventions”: “All told, Robinson identified about 3,000 words that Percy wrote into Mary's draft. Add that tally to changes that Percy is known to have made later, during the run-up to publication, and you have a total of about 5,000 words of Percy's in a 72,000-word novel.”

From this article, it seems Percy and Mary worked together to make the published story work best based on whatever standards they held at the time, but that it is a Mary Shelley creation. She wrote it, he tried to make it sing. 

Hope this helps.

That kind of ""Just asking a question!"" and evasiveness comes off as troll-bait misogyny. As I've said, *Frankenstein* is an incredibly important work in the entire history of human literature. Not many books invent a genre and almost none of those are by first-time authors. The fact that a *woman* wrote it in the first half of the 19th Century is incredibly significant. 

Looking at the [Wiki article on Mary Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley) there is a section about the authorship of *Frankenstein* but none of it indicates that Percy Bysshe Shelley is considered to be anything more than an editor or ""minor collaborator."" 

Looking at the [Wiki article for Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein), we see that Percy wrote four chapters that were appended to the beginning of Mary's novel before its first publication, but the Wiki also says:

If I were to apply the book's message in general terms (rather than only scientific, which I could see someone do) and say it in a few words, it would be: be responsible with the things you do/create.

Of course that short sentence does no semblance of justice to Frankenstein, but I'd say that's the very general outline of what it says. Not that you shouldn't be ambitious, but that you should be responsible and considerate of the consequences of your actions for yourself and others.

>in what way can it be bad

When you decide you want to play God and forget that, in creating a sentient being, you create a sentient being.

Towards the well being of whom none of your thoughts were turned, that is to say. Cause you were too busy thinking how much your new race would adore you, rather than ruin your life.

I adore the delicious the delicious irony of how often Frankenstein speaks of existence in words which would have been just as apropos had they been spoken by his creation:

> ""Nothing is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear."" *(In reference to Justine's death)* . . . ""Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me: but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations.""

Or the turn of phrase on being ""animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm"" in application to his studies of life and death. It was fascinating to hear the formative experiences which defined the creature's consciousness, especially as something on an archaic account of how identity was modeled in the 18th century. Or how - on an a related note - the creature with his immature if burgeoning knowledge of worldly affairs wept at the fate of the original habitants of the new continent. Not sure I have come across many personal opinions from other nationalities of the era which describes the colonization of America.

q8otwb_2,q8otwb,"My internet is out so I'm doing this on my mobile, bare with me...


**What are some of your favorite parts or quotes? What parts did you find confusing or wish were different?**


I didn't read any parts that are confusing. My favorite parts were when the ""monster"" was experiencing the world for the first time. I loved how he seemed so childlike with his naivete. I also felt so bad for him when he came to find realization that he was alone and that people considered him to be a monster.


**What is Victor Frankenstein's relationship to the environment or nature and what role does nature serve in the larger novel? When is he blind to nature and when is he enraptured by it?**


It seems like Frankenstein does appreciate nature and finds it to symbolize goodness. But with this understanding and appreciation comes guilt because he doesn't think he deserves to bask in the goodness of nature. I feel like Frankenstein feels he deserves to be excommunicated from the goodness of nature.


**What are your feelings upon hearing the creature's tale, as Frankenstein did? Do you agree with the doctor's reaction to the request for a second creation and with which character(s) do your sympathies lie?**


I fully sympathize with the monster. I cried when his plan failed. You're a product of your environment. And the ""monster"" knows no goodness or kindness for mankind. Of course he's going to retaliate against his creator. He simply does not want to be lonely.

That being said, I understand where Frankenstein is coming from. I don't agree with it but I understand. Yes the ""monster"" has shared his story and it is a tragic one. But how does he know the ""monster"" is not lying just to get what he wants? How does he know if the ""monster"" is capable of keeping his promise. I don't agree with Frankenstein's reaction towards the ""monster"" but I understand it. I'll also say that I'm glad that Frankenstein agreed to create a companion for his ""monster"".


**Who do you feel is culpable in the deaths of William and Justine?**

Obviously you can't dispute the ""monster"" is responsible. He murdered William. But to say that Frankenstein holds no blame is a faulty notion. He is responsible for his creation. Frankenstein also KNEW that Justine was innocent and didn't try hard enough to acquit her. The ""monster"" states he hates mankind because they hate him. The ""monster"" knows only hatred and horror from mankind, they deny him sympathy, kindness and love all of which are virtues that are needed to bring up a happy healthy child. The ""monster"" is childlike in that he is learning how the world works and where his place will eventually be in the world.


**In what ways are parental relationships depicted in the novel and what do you feel Shelley means to illustrate in these explorations?**


I'm not sure what parental relations Shelly is trying to depict with Frankenstein's father. However, there is a parental relationship with the ""monster"" and Frankenstein. Frankenstein is not only his creator but a parental figure as well. And as a parental figure Frankenstein is terrible. Frankenstein treats his ""monster"" as a monster. Frankenstein abandons the ""monster"" and lets him fend for himself in the world on his own without any basic knowledge. His ""monster"" is shown to be able to learn to read and speak french. So he's not an idiot he has intelligence but that intelligence is not nurtured and because of that his character may indeed rot to the monster that Frankenstein and the world believe him to be.


**What questions or predictions do you have moving forward and what do you hope to see? Is there a question you would like to posted to the group for next week?**


I'm really wishing for a happy ending, but this is a Gothic literature and I foresee a tragedy coming. I'm coming into the story pretty blind. I've never seen Frankenstein nor have I read the book before so I don't know how it ends.

We as an audience know that Frankenstein is following somebody. Who is he following and why? Here's my prediction: something is going to go wrong with the creation of Frankenstein's second creation and this will be the tipping point for our ""monster"". He will finally become the monster that everyone keeps telling him he is, with that we'll probably see the monster try to get revenge on Frankenstein.

When you compare that to his own creation, it’s not so different. He (the monster) wants to bring life into the world with a firm plan, determined that this genesis will have the outcome he predetermined– just like Victor did. When you think about people like that, who are so full of anger at the world because of their own isolation, they often think that a partner will solve all their problems. But that’s obviously a misconception when there are much deeper seated issues than that.

q8otwb_4,q8otwb,"I didn't feel as driven by this section as I did the first, but that may have been my exhaustion during the week. I think, narratively, things grind to a bit of a halt to hear the story of Frankenstein's monster recounted at such a pace. It does create sympathy for the creature much the same way the first volume created sympathy for Victor, despite his own heinous acts taken in creating the monster (grave robbing, animal abuse, etc). 

  
However, the description of the monster's intellectual development certainly mirrors Victor's, up until the formal education. To a point, I feel the plot has a few conveniences that modern critics would deride: The monster tells DeLacey he speaks French, but being Swiss, does Victor speak the same language? I don't know if French was an official language then as it is now, but do we know that Victor speaks French? I do find the detour into Safie's backstory, while thematically interesting, aside from adding to the creature's education slows the pacing again. And worst of all are the conveniences of finding Victor's bag with the novels and the notes on the creature's construction seemingly out of nowhere. That and the pure luck in finding William before killing him, the creature seems almost to be guided by divine hands.   


Overall, from what I remember of my previous readthroughs, this middle section - with its constant turns into despair and wretchedness, elaborate description leading to events we already know, and plot contrivances, is my least favourite section of the novel. 

 

>What is Victor Frankenstein's relationship to the environment or nature and what role does nature serve in the larger novel? When is he blind to nature and when is he enraptured by it?

&#x200B;

I believe Victor is done equating himself to a god. He sees the scale of the world and its control over him after the loss of William and Justine. His suicidal thoughts and his method of which (drowning) signal his subservience to nature as its subject, not an equal creator. 

&#x200B;

>What are your feelings upon hearing the creature's tale, as Frankenstein did? Do you agree with the doctor's reaction to the request for a second creation and with which character(s) do your sympathies lie?

&#x200B;

I understand Victor's hesitation to the creature's promise to leave him alone, yet I feel Victor realizes the only way to absolve himself of his sin is through some sort of penance. That Victor makes no attempt at a counteroffer, however, to accept and take in the monster is still a sign that he doesn't fully realize his culpability, despite the lip service he pays to it. This is why he firmly rejects the offer several times before finally accepting it.

&#x200B;

>Who do you feel is culpable in the deaths of William and Justine?

  
Victor. While the monster acknowledges the pain and despair the murders cause Victor - of course making him culpable - Vicor's neglect resulted in the social stunting of the creature. In all honesty, due to his failure to observe ethics in creating the monster, culpability, in my mind, leans heavily on Victor.   


>In what ways are parental relationships depicted in the novel and what do you feel Shelley means to illustrate in these explorations?

I explored this in more detail in my [first book club post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q3z2xj/comment/hfvdh2h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but I believe in this section Mary continues her motif of abandonment, whether physical, emotional, or intellectual. While the DeLacey's are a sort of outlier here, Safie's story continues he rend. Her father very much treas her as if property, emotionally and intellectually rejecting the independence to the point he may as well have abandoned her despite her making the choice to leave. Shelley seems to stress the important of emotionally involved parenting by presenting its lack in abundance throughout the novel.",viper1001,2021-10-15T16:57:23Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,4

7ywy8k_4,7ywy8k,"I was at a writing workshop, and we were critiquing a story by Benjamin Rosenbaum titled ""Senseless and Insensible"" that was a surrealistic takedown of Jane Austen. It was very weird and very funny. As we talked about it, I realized that Austen and Shelley were contemporary writers, but in English departments they are seldom talked about together. I wondered if there might be a story in combining them.

Then I went back to the books and discovered that in Frankenstein, when Victor goes to England in order to make a bride for the Creature, he stops in the town of Matlock. It turns out that in Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Darcy's estate is near the same town. So it would be possible, by juggling the dates, for Victor to run into characters from Pride and Prejudice. That got me going.

In FRANKENSTEIN it says that Victor traveled through England ""collecting the materials"" he would need to create a female creature. Well, one of the materials he'd need would be a female body. And of course, in Austen's novels men are always seeking brides. The idea just grew and grew the more I thought about it. ",JohnKessel,2018-02-20T17:23:39Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,4

I agree the frame story of the arctic explorer seems redundant. But I think part of the problem is the baggage that people come to the book with after all the movies and cultural tropes. We start the book expecting...Frankenstein and the monster. Instead, we get a bunch of stuff about Russia etc. But imagine if you never heard of Frankenstein, and u came to the book fresh and with no assumptions. And furthermore, remember how new the whole arctic thing was to the Victorians, and that beginning section will perhaps read differently.

2389zq_1,2389zq,"If you're reading consistently and thoroughly, you'll notice that the story is told by a man, Walton, writing letters to his sister. He's writing about Victor Frankenstein's story of creating his monster and hunting it down, and later he tells the story from the monster's perspective as Victor described it to him.

So, Walton is telling his sister what Victor told him and Victor is telling Walton what the monster told him. 

The point of these framed stories is to give the reader a range of character descriptions and leave it up to him or her to judge each character for themselves.

 Robert Walton paints Victor as a kind and interesting person because he finds him under certain circumstances, but once you start reading the story from Frankenstein's perspective, you being to see how cruel and twisted he is. As Victor tells his story, he describes his monster as a horrid, hideous mutant, and that gives you a sense that the monster is evil in some way. But once you start reading the narrative from the monster's point of view, you see how innocent and human the monster really is. He learns from sensory experience and he sees beauty in the world.

OP's idea about punishment definitely works, but /u/capincus must be right about the link Shelley is making to Prometheus's task of creating man from clay. 

The discussion has made me realise what I find good and bad about this novel. As a narrative, it's always struck me as the work of a novice. It has *debut novel* written all over it, and the endless repetitiveness and the psychological crudity seems explicable that way. But Shelley has a very firm grip on the moral universe within which she writes. She seems to be part of an early 19th Century tradition in which virtue is rewarded and sins (such as Frankenstein's pride) are not to be tolerated. In other words, Prometheus, a figure from pagan mythology, is given a Christian spin. The endless guilt that tortures Frankenstein (as cited by /u/penduh) becomes his own personal hell on earth.

What isn't clear is whether Frankenstein will ever be redeemed. This is a vital aspect of the Christian moral universe, and fallible characters in 19th Century fiction (think of Jane Austen) are usually able to achieve redemption through a change in their own self-satisfied or self-centred behaviour.

> Frankenstein by Mary Shelley.
Its reputation precedes it, and I found it very disappointing.
My knowledge of Frankenstein comes from popular culture where Dr. Frankenstein is a maniacal madman (redundant, but whatever) who is creating a monster for evil purposes. Or at least for kicks. And that he loves his monster as his own creation.
However, that’s not how the book goes.
Instead, Dr. Frankenstein creates the monster (and we’re never told how) and immediately hates and fears it when it comes alive. Then he flees and leaves the monster to its own devices. The monster eventually learns to speak. And is like a superhuman — it is faster, stronger and more capable of surviving physical extremes than humans.
There is none of the lumbering giant that is portrayed in movies and TV shows.
Eventually the monster and Frankenstein reunite, after the monster has killed a few people.
Overall, the book isn’t that bad, and I can’t blame it for how the movie studios have recreated it.

3erogi_1,3erogi,"Yeah, the 1818 version is much better than the 1836, which makes some strange changes towards the fatalistic and removes, among other things, the thematically relevant epigraph.

The longstanding standard edition is the Rieger Frankenstein, which, though it came after 1836, contains the original 1818 text. It also contains an introduction and notes by editor James Rieger, which, though helpful, do contribute to its length. I would recommend that one, but if you're really concerned about page count you could look for a text-only version of the 1818.",pollenruins,2015-07-27T17:55:50Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1

4isab2_1,4isab2,"1. Yes, Frankenstein is responsible for the tragedies which befall himself and his family. Because...
2. The monster is not at all to blame for his actions. He was created with, as Aristotle would call it, a tabula rasa (blank slate). He lacked perception of right and wrong. Frankenstein is to blame for the creature's actions because the creature simply acted in the way it had been treated by Frankenstein. If Frankenstein had treated the creature with compassion, it would likely have returned compassion to him and to others. But because all it knew was shame and death, it turned towards shame and death in revenge. ",KingofUzbekistan,2016-05-11T00:48:07Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1
4isab2_2,4isab2,"1. Victor Frankenstein is clearly responsible for the situation. He was experimenting with things he barely understood without thinking about what would happen should he succeed. That said, we don't really know what would have happened if he even tried to take care of his creature. We also have the monster narrate his story for a while and we know he's intelligent and understands what he's doing. In my opinion, the monster is also responsible maybe more than Victor because he obviously knew how to find him and instead of speaking to him he went directly to get revenge and killed an innocent.

2. We can't know for sure it would have changed anything but he doesn't seem to be doing much effort, does he?",ShortSightedOwl,2016-05-11T08:32:07Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,2
b7di6p_1,b7di6p,"Not really. I would even say that your points are rather generic.

While both stories tell the tragedy of prideful intelligentsia, I would say it is a very surface level comparison.

Victor plays God by creating a human, and when confronted with the realization of what he did, he lacks the courage to actually be God. Later, the story asks what makes a difference between a monster and a human.

Edward and Alphonse play God by breaking No. 1 rule and pay for it by losing body parts. Later, the story asks how far will the brothers go to return themselves to normalcy while also taking a part in >!Father's!< conspiracy to >!sacrifice the population of Amestris to create a giant philosopher's stone and absorb God!< .

Maybe '03 anime goes more ""Frankenstein"" as it diverges from its source material, but I think the original manga takes inspiration only in general ideas(dangers of science untamed by morals for example). 

However, I might be wrong as I read Frankenstein a few years ago and don't remember it too well. So take it with a grain of salt.",Hucpa,2019-03-30T20:40:44Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,1

6do0v0_1,6do0v0,"Thanks for your questions! In the ""Professor Nightmare"" series, the specific authors I've presented so far include William Shakespeare (in book one, ""Hamlet and the Ghost King"") and Mary Shelley (in the latest, ""Frankenstein and the Monster""). I'm still in the planning stages for book three, but I'm thinking about doing something with Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" though that's not really book-length. 

I cover a variety of themes in the ""Professor Nightmare"" series, though the books serve mostly as an introduction to the stories -- what they're about, who wrote them, what the setting is, etc. In the current book, for example, the characters are surprised to find themselves stuck in the Arctic, which is where the original ""Frankenstein"" opens and closes. I didn't know this till I was in college, so I thought it'd be fun to start there. The books also play with the ideas explored in the original works. So in the current book, for example, the kids learn that Frankenstein is the name of the scientist, not the monster, but they also touch on the question of who the real ""bad guy"" is, and what makes a true ""monster."" There's even a paragraph in there about how the original book is an epistolary (""A pistol what?"" as one character asks), which is a story told through letters. 

One theme that seems to pop up seemingly organically over and over again in my ""Professor Nightmare"" and other ""horror"" books and stories for kids is the idea of friendship. I always seem to drop kids into stories who have issues -- with each other or otherwise -- and who, through the course of the story, come together to overcome whatever obstacles there are. In the ""Professor Nightmare"" books, the protagonists are two boys, the class clowns, and ""the smartest girl in their fourth-grade class."" They don't always get along, but when they're thrust together in Professor Nightmare's books they tend to recognize each other's strengths and band together. In another of my books, ""The Diamond Gnomes,"" my 6-year-old came up with the initial ""scary"" parts of the plot, and when writing it all out the narrative that ended up tying it all together wound up being about two best friends who'd had a falling out; their dads had worked together and one had gotten fired while the other was promoted. There was a whole rich cool kid vs. loner poor kid dynamic. Then they ended up trapped in a cave and had to work together to escape, etc. 

It's an interesting theme that tends to pop up in the genre a lot; you see it in Stephen King a lot, for example, it's central to the plot of ""Stranger Things,"" etc. I wonder how many writers go into a project with that theme in mind and how many writers it just ""happens to"" in the course of the writing...

I have way too many ""favorite"" authors and stories to list here, but when it comes to classic horror I don't think anyone beats H.P. Lovecraft. He's got a big following in the geek and creative communities, but he's relatively unknown by a lot of people popularly, which is really too bad. His works as whole pieces aside -- which are amazing -- there are so many specific moments and scenes in his various stories that have inspired so many of the horror and science-fiction themes and scenes we consume today, and many of us don't even know he's the guy who probably did them first. Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" is great. If you've never read the original, it's reputation is well deserved; it holds up really well and really is a page-turner. Two recommendations for old-school horror not many people have read, both published in the 1790s, are ""The Monk,"" by Matthew Lewis (it's long and mostly boring, but just skim those parts; the scary parts are capital-H horror and worth wading through the rest) and ""Wieland,"" by Charles Brockden Brown. The latter holds up surprisingly well and reads like a 1790s ""X-Files"" episode. 

Thinking of current genre writers I immediately go to R.L. Stine, just because his ""Goosebumps"" books were such a HUGE part of my youth. His influence can't be overstated. I dedicated my first book -- ""The Barrens House"" -- to him and mailed it to him and he wrote me back thanking me; the letter is framed on my wall. I've been digging back into comics and graphic novels lately, which is a pretty intense phase I go through for a few months every few years for whatever reason, and there are a lot of great horror or horror/sci-fi writers doing great things in comics. Scott Snyder immediately comes to mind (try ""Wytches"" to start). Jeff Lemire's ""Black Hammer"" and Brian K. Vaughan's ""Paper Girls"" are both current ongoing series that cross the science-fiction/horror genres and I'm really enjoying both. 

What about you? What are your favorites? What are you reading now?

6do0v0_2,6do0v0,"Great questions, thank you! As a full-time digital marketer for a college by day, a lot of my time is spent creating content for various websites, social media platforms, blogs, etc., and a lot of that content is visual. I also serve as the official college photographer, and years ago in my senior year of college as an undergrad I interned at the local daily newspaper as a copy editor, where I'd lay out several pages of the newspaper each day. This is all background to say that I actually don't hire anyone to do my covers; I just do them myself using editing and design software that I also use professionally. 

More formal graphic designers would probably do layout in a program like Adobe InDesign, but I usually use Photoshop because that's what I'm most proficient at using. I keep my covers pretty simple. Here are a few of the latest:

[""Professor Nightmare Recommends 2: Frankenstein and the Monster""](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x8hw9kwrg035ar4/Frankenstein%20cover%20FINAL.jpg?dl=0)

[""Professor Nightmare Recommends 1: Hamlet and the Ghost King""](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d8lbxm6u91nnz93/Hamlet%20cover%20final%202%20front%202.jpg?dl=0)

[""Avi & Simon's Freaky Tales 1: The Diamond Gnomes""](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dgwff0c5fvm1uq8/4x6%20diamond%20gnomes%20one-piece%20cover.jpg?dl=0)

Through some trial and error I've landed on a kind of template for each series. So I know going in to each of the ""Professor Nightmare"" books, for example, that each will have a different color scheme, will feature a photo representation of the main ghost or creature in black and white, and will feature cartoon-like drawings of the kids looking freaked out. I don't consider myself super talented at the drawing part necessarily, I just do it because it's most convenient to do it myself and it works well enough. I take the traditional comic book art approach to the cartoon part, penciling first, then inking, then scanning it in and coloring it digitally before laying it out over the photo. I'm getting better and faster at it as I go, I think, which is nice to see. For the photo element I search around in various public domain archives online, like the [Library of Congress Digital Collections](https://www.loc.gov/collections/), etc., and slowly narrow things down from a bunch of possible photo options. These archives are great for inspiration for new stories, by the way, if you ever want to start a new project but aren't sure where to begin.

I think the most annoying thing about the covers, especially working with print-on-demand online printers with slow turnaround on projects, is getting the cover dimensions/size correct. The systems tell you what the dimensions of your cover should be, including where the spine starts and ends, etc., but every print run is slightly different, and it takes an order or two of books and slight tweaks here and there before I get things to a place I'm OK with. 

The design part is fun but it's also really time consuming, at least for me. Each ""Professor Nightmare"" book takes me approximately 20 hours to create from start to finish (not counting any research and outlining to prep), and close to half the total time is spent figuring out and executing the cover design. One big benefit of working with an actual publisher, in my opinion, would be that I could just work on the writing and maybe provide some insights or direction on the cover but generally leave the actual cover execution to the publisher's design team. I'd probably have a much larger output in terms of the writing, that's for sure. 

It does help some to kind of know how you want your cover to look like ahead of time, especially if you have all the elements together already (the photos, colors, fonts, etc., selected in advance), because then it takes less time to put it all together when it gets to that point. That's another benefit of using a template for the series, as well. 

As for valuable general lessons about self-publishing, I'll probably come back to this one later with a more in-depth reply when I've had some time to really think about it, but I think knowing what you want going in is important. You need to be doing it because you like it or because you're passionate about it. If you go into a project thinking it'll make you rich and you'll never have to work again, you're likely setting yourself up for discouragement, and the last thing any writer needs is more self-doubt. I wrote about this in another response in this thread, but a big reason I like to produce books like this is so my 7-year-old daughter will see that writing books is something anyone can do, something she can do, if she wants to. I regularly print copies of various books so she can give them to the kids in her class, which is fun. Also, after two full years of grad school -- I finished last summer -- where we regularly had to write research papers that were 20 pages long or more (I think my final was 60 or 70 pages), writing book-length manuscripts that don't require days of dry research for references is relatively easy, and I have fun doing it. 

Hopefully some of this is helpful. Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions!",SimonThalmann,2017-05-27T22:21:02Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Frankenstein,2
