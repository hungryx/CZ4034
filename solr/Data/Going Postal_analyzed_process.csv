bs3bus_1,bs3bus,"Going Postal is probably one of my favorite Pratchett books.   The Night Watch books are probably the best ones.  I would highly recommend Guards, Guards! as your next one, or maybe Small Gods since that also has a lot of parallels to real life",jbeldham,2019-05-23T15:05:41Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,1
bs3bus_2,bs3bus,"Welcome to the club! 

I would recommend Mort and Pyramids, not of the basis of Going Postal but just because they‚Äôre great! 

Also fun fact, he lived very close to my hometown and I used to see him in the Supermarket alot haha! Lovely guy.",,2019-05-23T15:33:11Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,2
bs3bus_3,bs3bus,"""Going Postal"" was at the top of his game. It was even made into a movie.

""Hogfather"" is right up there too, and was also made into a movie. We usually watch it around Christmas, when everyone else is watching ""It's a wonderful life.""",Markqz,2019-05-23T17:49:49Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,3
bs3bus_4,bs3bus,"If you liked Going Postal, the direct sequel (I think) is Making Money. 

Enjoy. My personal favorites are the Sam Vimes and Rincewind arcs. Or Death. Or the witches...bugger all, just keep reading )",Herr_Underdogg,2019-05-23T19:08:34Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,4
bs3bus_5,bs3bus,Amazon Prime has the movie version of Going Postal and it‚Äôs quite good. I enjoyed seeing the directors idea of the fleshed out characters versus my own.,MadamWoo2,2019-05-23T19:22:57Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,5
bs3bus_6,bs3bus,Going Postal is still my absolute favorite Pratchett novel!  I love the social commentary in it!,fskern,2019-05-23T20:07:39Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,6
bs3bus_7,bs3bus,"I highly recommend reading Mort. I feel like Going Postal and this one are among his best just because the story is more interesting to me.

Reading Pratchett's discworld series has just been amazing. I discovered his work just last year. I think I love his sense of humor and quirky sensibilities , especially because they come through his writing style. So amazing..",standswithpencil,2019-05-23T17:45:09Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,7
bs3bus_8,bs3bus,"Awesome! Going Postal was one of my first few ones in the Discworld books, too. Hope you‚Äôll love the Watch series as well.",lopiqol,2019-05-23T18:24:11Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,8
bs3bus_9,bs3bus,"Going Postal is my favorite, as well.

If you've got the inclination to read all of the Discworld books, then I suggest reading them in the order they were published. This is also chronological order. You get to watch what starts out as a bog-standard fantasy universe get embroiled in world wars and go through an industrial revolution.

Just be aware that the early books are **not** as engaging as Going Postal, unfortunately. But by the time you hit (IMO) Men At Arms, the series is in full swing.",goatili,2019-05-23T19:15:01Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,9
bs3bus_10,bs3bus,"Color of Magic was a difficult one to get into (also the first Pratchett book I read), but the humor made me curious as to what else he'd written. I've read several Discworld books now and Going Postal is actually my least favorite one... Loved Mort (and everything else Death makes an appearance in) and Night Watch!",xMari7,2019-05-23T20:28:27Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,10

bs3bus_14,bs3bus,"Going Postal is one of my absolute favourites and I‚Äôve read it quite a few times now. Mort is commonly held up as perhaps the best, and the character of Death is certainly one of the most iconic of Terrys creations but I prefer the Watch series of books. I just love how you can watch Discworld change throughout the entire series, getting more modern with each instalment. Sir Terry will be sorely missed, his particular brand of humour unlikely to ever be seen again.",Azuzu88,2019-05-23T23:36:17Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,14
bs3bus_15,bs3bus,"If you want to read more Discworld, I recommend the standalone, one off novels don‚Äôt aren‚Äôt part of a series.

 Pratchett was, IMO, always at his best when writing fresh, one-off novels set in Discworld. Small Gods, Reaper Man, Monstrous Regiment, Pyramids and The Truth are by far my favourite books in the series. Moist‚Äôs story are up there too, and out of the three his first book Going Postal is by far the best.

Pratchett was the best English satirist in his lifetime and, despite a shaky start, his entire repertoire is worth reading.",lupussol,2019-05-24T00:38:44Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,15
bs3bus_16,bs3bus,"Going Postal was my first Discworld novel too! After that I went through and read them all in order. It's true what people are saying, that the first few books aren't quite as deep as the later novels. I don't think they're bad, just very different in tone. The books take themselves a little more seriously as the series matures.

I still really liked Colour of Magic and Light Fantastic.",Evaliss,2019-05-24T02:26:10Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,16

bs3bus_20,bs3bus,Color of magic is very satirical but very dry. There are a lot of proper nouns it is impossible to keep track of and can be confusing. Just an fyi it is really hate it or love it and i found it quite different from going postal. Guards guards series is great and a lot more of an easy read. Look up the flow chart for pratchet series if you liked going postal try hogfather next,,2019-05-24T00:55:32Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,20
bs3bus_21,bs3bus,There are two books I believe with the character moist von lipwig in them. Going Postal is one and Making Money is the other. I would highly recommend these to anyone interested in read sir terry prachett. All of his books that I have read (and I have read a lot of them) have been amazing. Also he has a book he wrote with  Neil Gaiman called Good Omens which is being turned into a tv series i believe. But just about all of TP's books are amazing I think.,,2019-05-23T21:03:56Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,21

fpmgq3_5,fpmgq3,"CBA TO EDIT: I'm obviously overcaffeinated, the TV adaptions are not recent (Going Postal is from 2010, Colour of Magic 2008 and Hogfather 2006!)

fpmgq3_7,fpmgq3,"Jingo is was written 18 years before Pratchett died. After Jingo you have a whole bunch of books  I'd include amongst his best: Night Watch, The Amazing Maurice, Carpe Jugulum, The Truth, and while I can see why people might not think Monstrous Regiment is the best, its followed by Going Postal, Thud and the none discowrld Nation which are all great. 

Yes they become more story oriented, but I don't think that's due to Alzheimers. And personally I don't think that's to their detriment.

Edit: corrected Nation's timeline.",armcie,2020-03-27T14:58:01Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,7
fpmgq3_8,fpmgq3,"my two favorite sub-series are the night watch books, which are about a drunkard police chief getting his act together and trying to create a functional police force out of a gang of useless layabouts in fantasy london, and the Death series, which is about Death, who is just kind of trying to go about his business reaping souls and all that. 

the first night watch book is Guards, Guards! and it‚Äôs about trying to foil the plots of an insidious cult that‚Äôs trying to summon dragons in a convoluted plot to bring monarchy back to ankh-morpork. the first Death book is called Mort, and it‚Äôs about Death taking a human apprentice, but later books only get weirder. one is about Death becoming a farmer, one is about Death becoming... santa claus??? at one point he tries to reconnect with his estranged granddaughter. at this point it is worth noting that Death is a literal skeleton.

the moist von lipwig series (the one you started reading, which starts with going postal) is good, but it‚Äôs very short, and it was mostly written near the end of pratchett‚Äôs life, when he was seriously suffering from alzheimer‚Äôs. the about the author sections in his later books notes that he was no longer able to read or write, and used a text-to-speech program to compose his later novels. going postal IS fucking incredible, tho, and iirc was written long before that (i think???). i wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of Raising Steam, but i was so attached to the characters that i didn‚Äôt mind. it‚Äôs a fucking miracle it was written at all, to be honest!

the wizards series has the opposite problem: the first few books were written so early on in pratchett‚Äôs career that they‚Äôre generally not considered a good representative of the series as a whole! the very first discworld book was a wizards book, The Colour of Magic, which was... fine! it introduced a lot of cool concepts, but it‚Äôs a totally different tone, and seems like it‚Äôs satirizing a totally different era of fantasy literature than the rest of the series is - more conan the barbarian than lord of the rings. i still enjoyed them when i finally read them though, lol.

also feel free to correct me on any of this, i‚Äôm a very casual fan and i‚Äôm certain i got some stuff wrong, because i didn‚Äôt want to check my facts. i am especially sure that i got the spelling of ankh-morpork wrong, which is deeply distressing to me

tl;dr: discworld is a series of SUB-SERIES!! which ones you read are up to you, but it‚Äôs generally advisable to start at the beginning of a sub-series and continue to the end, as each sub-series follows a different group of characters and their character development happens throughout the whole sub-series. (there is some overlap, characters will show up in unexpected books, it‚Äôs basically like the fantasy MCU. for example, Sam Vimes shows up in a bunch of other stories, because he‚Äôs the chief of police and a pretty important figure during most of the timeline.) someone‚Äôs already posted the reading chart, which should help.",,2020-03-27T02:58:40Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,8

fpmgq3_10,fpmgq3,"Other people have already said it, but my favorite arc are the City Watch books. Start with ‚ÄúGuards, Guards!‚Äù

The discworld series is interesting because there‚Äôs one big timeline that the different books fall onto, but it‚Äôs not always necessary to read books from different arcs in order. So, going postal comes after a lot of the city watch books, but you probably didn‚Äôt get any spoilers. At most, you might be a tiny bit confused and might miss a joke or two (for instance, one of the last city watch books references Moist in a funny way.) 

Anyways, I‚Äôm getting long winded. If you like audio books, Stephen Briggs narrates almost all of Terry Pratchett‚Äôs books, and he‚Äôs fantastic. Definitely recommend, even though some of the older books don‚Äôt have fantastic quality. 

As for other arcs, the witches are good for a laugh, as well. There are a few books there, and most aren‚Äôt in the city, so there‚Äôs less overlap/need for context.

fpmgq3_11,fpmgq3,"I started with Going Postal, and Night Watch, around the same time. After NW, I read the entire Watch series. They, and Moist, intertwine later. Not as big a fan of the stuff outside Ankh-Morpork, but it's still great writing.

Sam Vimes, Moist von Lipwig, Wee Mad Arthur, and Lord Vetinari. Top 4.

fpmgq3_12,fpmgq3,"I disagree with what others have said. Don't read making money next. It's too similar to Going Postal, and the Moist von Lipwig as a character isn't developed much more until Raising Steam. 

However, it would be a good return to Moist once you've acquainted yourself with a few other characters. My next stop would be Guards Guards, as it introduces Samuel Vimes and the city watch.",,2020-03-27T07:21:04Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,12

The weird outliers are moving picture and The Amazing Maurice And His Educated Rodents which are only loosely connected to Ankhmorpork and The Last Hero that‚Äôs really a part of all 5 categories but since the main characters are all from Rincewind book collection it classed it as a Rincewind book.",Gruzzel,2020-03-27T14:12:12Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Going Postal,14
