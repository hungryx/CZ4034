Do you see any influence of the famous Cool Girl monologue from Gone Girl? I first saw the movie but this part was thaat led me to check the book and then your other books as well. So I was wondering if you come across women identifying with it often and what are its interpretations.

yqsb3o_10,yqsb3o,"I think I have your essay 'Not a Nice Girl' saved in my phone. Its such a perfect piece to explain how so many 'feminist' (written by men) characters feel hollow and not that empowering. 

Do you plan on writing any more short form? Essays, or poems? 

It seems that your books are so based in your life, Gone Girl, especially.  Do you have any characters that are your favorites. 

I love that you wrote a forward for Flowers in The Attic, a novel that I read when I was far too young.

And, I am so curious, but how is your relationship with your mother?, haha

yqsb3o_11,yqsb3o,"gone girl absolutely blew me away. I picked up a signed first of it this year, something I only do for things that really touched me.

probably my fifth or sixth favorite novel written since 1980, meaning you're being beaten only by *blood meridian* and *infinite jest* and such. so much fun, such exquisite malevolence. I saw the spirit of my dead fiancee, she the bracingly mad and she the shatteringly unique, in your Amy Dunne. thank you for writing it.

yqsb3o_38,yqsb3o,"Huge fan, wish I got this in earlier! Love this AMA. Just finished reading Gone Girl then watched the movie. The book was Amazing. Question: How much of a voice did you have in the film adaptation? I ask, because many parts of book Nick's character were lost in the movie, in my most humble opinion. In the book, I could really feel the desperation from him as he interviewed past Amy victims. In the film he just kind of bumbled along. The ending was a bit different too, with Nick's final words redacted as well (something along the lines of ""I feel sorry for you, because every day you have to wake up and be you"". It felt perfect, because as a reader you know it's never going to be ok. Sorry, I guess my question is, do you feel Nick was minimized a bit in the film, and was this a conscious choice, and did it really even matter or impact the meat of the story, in your opinion?

If that question sucks, how bout this: What is your go-to to escape the walls of writer's block?",guilty_bystander,2022-11-09T21:56:50Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,38

yqsb3o_75,yqsb3o,"I have to say my inspiration for my books often comes from a larger theme I’m playing with. For instance, with my first novel, Sharp Objects, I’d been trying to write about the idea of female violence and how that looks generationally versus male violence—which is the theme of a million books. I felt cyclical female aggression and violence hadn’t been tackled. I realized I could attach it to a mystery to give it a real engine, For Gone Girl, I was both obsessed with how marriage—particularly the wedding-industrial complex and the early years of marriage— really triggers the traditional male/female roles (I’d just gotten married and was thinking a lot about this; I suddenly had the urge to put on flowered aprons, which was a wholly new instinct to me.) I combined that with my obsession with true crime—how the cases that most often got national coverage were ones with Pretty White Girls. So I created Amazing Amy, who knew how to use that prejudice for her own ends.",gillianflynn,2022-11-09T20:07:14Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,75

16gxk4w_1,16gxk4w,"There's a theory of feminist literature called... Jesus I can't remember now, and google is failing me. But it's called something like Diana Mythos? 

Anyways at the risk of half remembering and explaining badly, it goes something like;

Men get to be all kinds of shapes and sizes in fiction. Bad, good, strong, weak, interesting, flawed, balding, paunchy. He's both Robin Hood and he's the Sheriff of Nottingham and he's Prince John and he's King Richard, she is ONLY Maid Marion. For centuries and centuries of written text women got to be only a much narrower set of characters - virgin or whore, MAYBE if you're lucky mother or crone. It's usually narrow, usually defined by her relationship to the hero, who is always the man.

So, there's a kind of power in any story that has agency. She might be doing something bad but at least she's doing SOMETHING, jfc. It's way out there stuff, it's not that anyone's saying it's morally okay, but it's nice to have a fantasy of power out there. No one ever argues about that Hannibal Lecter was GOOD or whether or not showing him on tv is misandrist, just that he was fun as hell to watch and you low key couldn't take your eyes off him. Let women be in the same space.

The first example I heard it spoken about was the comic books ""Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist."" The best example I can think of is Rosamund Pike's character in I Care a Lot. Just show us women in more of our atrocious facets, please, Christ, please.

I don't know if the argument holds up to including Gone Girl as a text. I've never read it, just absorbed it through cultural osmosis. I don't like the idea of it personally because I think it's left a gross cultural legacy in terms of disbelieving victims of abuse, plus from what I can understand it plays into some gross bunny boiler tropes.

 But in the context of this framework, I can see how someone would read it as a feminist text.

(I'm not advocating this take and I'm on a lot of dayquil.)

It also may just be as simple as the fact that it passes the sexy lamp test;

16gxk4w_2,16gxk4w,"""feminist story"" doesn't mean ""story about a feminist"". One of the most common issues with the way women are portrayed in stories is that they have zero agency. Gone Girl takes a familiar narrative--woman goes missing, husband desperate to find her, sparks support nationwide--and turns it upside down. She's orchestrating all of this, she's manipulating the public opinion, and she's always been one step ahead.

What I find interesting is that people have no problems with indulgent, charismatic, intelligent villains. There's no shortage of Hannibal Lectors, Jokers, or Patrick Batemans. We can even empathize with aspects of their worldview, because in spite of us clearly understanding that they are evil and wrong, they reveal something about society that is evil and wrong as well.

16gxk4w_3,16gxk4w,">I see isolated feminist moments like the cool girl monologue. But, at least by my reading, the point of this monologue is less that trying to play to male fantasies eventually drives people crazy, and it’s more a supremely inauthentic person projecting. Amy’s act didn’t start because she wanted to appeal to mediocre men; it started with Amazing Amy. She makes a feminist point, but that doesn’t make this an inherently feminist story.

I think you are vastly underestimating how much that monologue connected with women.  Multiple women I know IRL retyped that passage to put it up on their social media.  I have never seen that happen with another piece of writing.

Amy is a crazy person, but the cool girl thing she is describing is a real pressure women face.  Perhaps a bit less so than when the book originally came out, but it is 100% a real pressure.  

>Now, I’m a guy so maybe I’m missing it, but here is my basic read on the story: a guy puts on a bit of an act to get a girl who’s out of his league. He loses his money, his mother gets sick, it quickly becomes clear the marriage doesn’t work, and he has a kind of gross affair with a younger woman. This all makes him a standard bad dude that you feel a little bit of pity for because he’s had a tough go of it but ultimately you dislike imo.

I believe Amy's money paid for the house and the bar.  A big part of why she feels trapped is that her money has been invested into the life he wants.  She trusted him and he trapped her in a dying rust belt town.  Then he fucking cheated on her.  I think he is more of an asshole that you are acknowledging here.

Personally, I don't think of Gone Girl as a feminist book.  Feminist is not a label I tend to put on fiction.  But I would day that Gone Girl is an incredibly feminine book.  It looks at the world through a female lens.",elinordash,2023-09-12T19:00:24Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,3

She's a villain and a bad person (albeit a complicated person), but she's also incredibly interesting. Male literary main characters get to run the gamut, but for female main characters, there are few iconic ""evil"" or outright manipulative to evil effect characters. Maybe more so now then at the time Gone Girl was written (2012), but how many female evil characters that were the main character of their book or movie can you name off the top of your head? 
  
At its core, Gone Girl is a thriller, and Amy is one of the main characters of it. She's the bad guy (although she certainly has reasons, disproportionate though they may be, for her decisions) and that decision and the nuanced portrayal of her was a feminist choice of the author.",ollieastic,2023-09-12T19:39:10Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,4

Feminism exists to center the experience of women. Full stop. Feminist theory in literature means we are writing and/or reading books that care about what the female character wants, needs, is, does, sometimes specifically within a patriarchal power structure, sometimes without. 

The feminism of Gone Girl isn’t girl power. It’s the dismantling of patriarchal assumptions of what a female protagonist should be. The first half creates that myth, while the second half goes topsy-turvy. 

If Amy is Rapunzel locked in her tower, a very very very simplified view of the feminist reading of this book, is that not only does Amy climb down her own hair to escape, she also destroys the tower stone by stone. And yes, she built that tower. But we care most about her, and her experience of the world, not about any body else’s.",seanmharcailin,2023-09-12T22:27:02Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,6

Forced into a maternal role to make the men they date/married rise to their level.  Women have to be perfect for men.  They can’t be seen as a work in progress that need to be supported.  women are chastised by general society if they don’t condone mediocre men or help them become their “best” selves.  But men refuse to do the same.  I mean it’s pretty common to hear of men that left their wives because they got too sick or for a younger women.  

Gone Girl’s Amy is an embodiment of the down right resentment some women hold towards men.

16gxk4w_9,16gxk4w,"This is a very surface analysis compared to some of the others, but part of the ""allure"" is tricking the trickster.

Men lie and manipulate and trap women who are largely stuck as the victims. They get what they want, and the women suffer for it. 

In Gone Girl, Nick thinks he's getting what he wants. He deploys the same tactics to try and trap and ""conquer"" Amy and get away with his shit behavior. But Amy is not who he thinks she is. She is 10 times the bad person Nick is.

It's about seeing him get fooled. He thinks he's playing the game, so many men play and succeed. He thinks he gets to have his perfect happy life with the woman he lied to and hurt and cheats on, and there's no consequences. But Amy is fucking nuts. He loses his little game and then some. 

Nick and Amy are representative of the swaths of people in the larger picture. It is not Amy as an individual who is exciting or feels feminist. It's the concept of women flipping the chessboard on the men that Nick is a stand-in for and seeing them get their comeuppance. It's very much an escapist narrative of punishing the patriarchy by subverting their expectations. 

Amy goes ""too far"" because she, as a character, is representative of the female rage that has simmered and festered. Their story as individuals is compelling, but the broader narrative of getting back at the forces that have beat down and trapped women is what is tantalizing for feminist analysis. It's the concept of ""what if we just snapped and went fucking apeshit and let them see what we are capable of? what if they get to taste the bitter pill they've shoved in women's throats for thousands of years?""

What you miss as a man is the resentment a lot of women feel at their core for how we get treated and how we see ourselves and other women being used. Seeing what Amy does isn't just narratively compelling. It's cathartic. Most people wouldn't ever do the things she does, but the fantasy of just snapping and getting to be the shitty person without consequences for once against your oppressors.",snaughtydog,2023-09-12T19:56:26Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,9

I think there's something feminist about this idea of a highly intelligent woman just wasting away as a housewife with an unfaithful, ungrateful husband and then turning that intelligence into a weapon. It's both the natural consequence of and also revenge for wasting and stifling women's capabilities.

It's like this battle cry: we are not going to be ignored. We are not going to be taken for granted. We are not going to be used.

16gxk4w_16,16gxk4w,"Feminism isn't the belief that women are inherently good or better than men. It's the belief that women are potentially *as good* as any other person, and that means they also have the capacity to be just as bad as everyone else. Gillian Flynn's work is very much a reaction to the idea that only 'good', nice female characters are allowed to be protagonists. Her female protagonists are often some combination of selfish, sexist, lazy, and downright cruel.

Which is to say: You're 100% right, Amy is a total psycho. The 'cool girl' quote is about Amy's own internalized sexism and anti-feminism; it's a long rant about how she hates other women, and how she's the only 'valid' one wrt her relationships with men.

The book is feminist because it's writing the kind of book that would normally only star a male character (think Patrick Bateman, other classic 'bad guy' characters), but it stars a female character. That's all. Amy isn't supposed to be good or kind or 'cool'. She's a 'gone girl' physically-- she disappears-- but she's also gone metaphorically: there is nothing in her heart.

But a lot of people, so accustomed to only reading books where female main characters are feminist paragons, miss this and think Amy is admirable.

16gxk4w_23,16gxk4w,"I didn’t take it as feminist at all. I read it for the first time about 6 months ago. I took it as a very detailed portrayal of a severe personality disorder that was exacerbated by an emotionally immature partner who deceived and took her for granted. I thought they were both terrible people. 

But Amy was far more complex than simply “evil”. I saw nothing redeeming about her in anyway that affirms equality/agency for women. Some of the internal dialog and interactions between characters might have dipped into feminist theory here and there. But “women are just as evil as men” seems too reductive to me. This was a book about psychopathy within a marriage that was basically like most marriages. Boredom. Selfishness. Deception. Psychopathy. 

Publishing the book could be considered a feminist achievement for the author. A female psychopath is sort of unique I guess? Was Single White Female a feminist movie? One of the more delicious aspects of Gone Girl was that the author artfully deceived the reader. Readers are likely to sympathize with one character over the other until there is a beautiful, slow roll out of holy shit! This bitch psycho! I think the author teased an easy “feminist” stand up for your rights sort of narrative and then completely turned it on its head. 

Feminism is not “women good/men bad”. That’s why it’s hard for so many people to analyze via a feminist lens. Anyway, great book. People should definitely check it out.

16gxk4w_29,16gxk4w,"I don't necessarily think you would fail the litmus test because you do recognise *one of* the feminist points made by the cool girl monologue. The bar is low. 

I was one of the first people I knew to read Gone Girl, and enjoyed it the first time I read it, in that it's clearly a revenge / power fantasy, and in those the protagonist often acts in non-heroic ways that are justified by righting a wrong done against them. You can argue whether the level of punishment fits the crime, but that's not really the point - the point is an exaggerated feeling of triumph over people / the kind of person who has wronged you. Men have had a lot of these stories, women haven't had many if any, and often 'revenge stories' were still made to be titillating to men - e.g. rape revenge horror movies often focus heavily on the rape, and then even then the revenge will be largely gory spectacle and not emotionally satisfying. Midsommar was also like this for some women, the fact that a woman won over a man that treated her badly was emotionally satisfying (BTW you can think this and also be aware that this is not the point of the film/book). It really doesn't happen in media that often, particularly not with actual aggressive behaviour that the narrative doesn't shame versus symbolic winning.

That said, I still knew that Amy was equally supposed to be a sociopath, you were supposed to be horrified by the lengths she was willing to go to, and that you were supposed to leave the book with ambivalent feelings about it all. & as other women I knew, particularly ones I'd recommended it to, I did notice that some of them didn't have these ambivalent feelings, which got me questioning if the text was genuinely setting out to provoke them.

I came to re-evaluate the book after reading the other two actually - Sharp Objects and Dark Places - when I realised >!they also take place against a background of low level misogyny BUT the killer, the immediate problem, is a woman, every time. Often a mother - Amy finishes Gone Girl a mother too.!< So now I think Gillian Flynn is not making well-thought out commentary on gender roles or attempts at psychologically and morally complicated revenge fantasies for women - I honestly think she has some sort of issue about mothers, about mother-daughter dynamics to work out, and it's just a coincidence that Gone Girl blew up rather than either of the other two.

It feels a bit dismissive to say that about a female author - oh, she's just got mummy issues - and I did feel guilty about that until Gone Girl got cited in the Heard vs Depp trial. Whatever your take on that trial, a work of fiction should NOT have been used to present a supposedly plausible scenario for a real life court case. And I never heard about Gillian Flynn commenting on it at all - which, if she cared about the rammifications and deeper meanings behind her work, I think there would be no reason not to speak out.

So I think if there is feminist commentary in Flynn's work, it's more to do with motherhood and parental dynamics (like how Amazing Amy makes Amy what she is) than to do with a battle of the sexes.",livingadhesively,2023-09-12T19:36:47Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,29

And relationships with parents, the public, and partners CAN get intolerable in this way for women more than you’d think. Like if you let the rage win, this is where it’d take you—and it’d be a dark and shitty  place to be.

Also, painfully, how we see our friends contort themselves. And then see ourselves or our friends mistreated and abused in some relationship is truly infuriating. 

So literature is a safe place to realize that you DO identify with the rage, but also why indulging it is so destructive. Of course Amy is the villain, that’s the point. She’s the worst version of what that rage could be.",chocoheed,2023-09-13T20:23:52Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,32
16gxk4w_33,16gxk4w,Gone Girl is feminist literature because the protagonist is a woman who occupies a space of narrative complexity and agency traditionally reserved for men.,No_Rise_2920,2023-09-14T00:06:44Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,33
16gxk4w_34,16gxk4w,"I don't think Gone Girl is a feminist story in the sense it is about feminism or makes an argument about feminism.

As a piece of writing, it is almost post-feminist in the sense that its central character is not limited in ways female characters often are. The author Gillian Flynn kinda said that writing this unlikable female character was feminist act for her as a writer.

And the cool girl speech was a feminist moment for lots of women who didn't necessarily have words to describe this exact thing... and so it has a historical place in a  consciousness raising sense.

But both of these are ancillary to the story and plot - which were not and were not intended to be especially feminist. Just fun.

I can't help but root for Amy, but in the same way I can't help but root for Hannibal Lecture.

16gxk4w_38,16gxk4w,"Yes absolutely. The novel is very astute in it's depiction of gender roles and makes some super interesting points about romance, relationships and social expectations. 
But a feminist book does not need to have a feminist protagonist. Amy is not a good role model, nor is she a feminist in any meaningful sense of the word. If anything, she (ab)uses feminist structures and movements for her own ends. For example, she's counting on the activism of victim advocates to incriminate her husband, even if he's innocent. 

That said, I'd consider this book to be one of the most misunderstood (along with Fight Club and Lolita), both my incels/MRAs (who argue that there is an epidemic of false rape accusations) AND by some feminists.

16gxk4w_44,16gxk4w,"This exactly. Gone Girl isn't as much a feminist manifesto as it is a satire on American marriage. Amy is more obviously and exaggeratedly evil, but Nick's actions are sinister in the carefree way that's expected of husbands. 

Over the brief course of their marriage he turns an independent, successful, prideful, type-A, intelligent woman into a Stepford Wife. When they move to the midwest Amy hasn't done anything bad yet, but Nick had already started treating her like a villain. He doesn't ask her if she wants to move even tho she would have said yes. He resents her for her money even after she gives him all the funds to start his dream bar. She's in a foreign place, taking plates and hosting potlucks like a dutiful wife but Nick still frames her as a stuck up New Yorker. He never vents about his frustrations he just gets mad at her for trying to get him to open up. He spends her money during the recession then shuts her down when she brings it up. Their whole marriage he neglects her, and after his mom passes he basically acts like she doesn't exist. She was a wealthy, successful writer who moved to podunk nowhere for him, let him blow her money, cleaned the house while he played video games, played nice with his old country friends, and yet he acts like her mere presence is a bother to him. 


Amy is quite extra, she does have very high standards. But she continuously lowers them to please him. She would never do this for any guy but Nick initially poses himself as on her level. He plays the role until he doesn't have to. She holds on cause she wants it to work, he's made it work before, and because she does love him even if she also loves the idea of their relationship. As batshit as she is, the book does make it clear all the reasons that she loves him. Nick doesn't really seem to love her as much as he loves that he bagged a smoking hot fuckmaid. She's high maintenance but Nick won't even put in a normal amount of work. He often won't even do the bare minimum that the other husbands do. And Amy is so smart that she thinks she's letting him. But Nick exerts passive control over her. She makes herself smaller and smaller just to please him in hopes that he'll give her the smallest amount of love that she desperately craves. I would even call it abusive. The reason most don't see it that way is cause it's so common and so subtle.

The way Amy retaliates is an inverse of Nick. She's very intentional, calculated, high concept. But all Nick had to do was put his weight on her then go limp. She was chained to him, then he gets stuck with her. Nick weathered Amy down into a perfect housewife. Amy forced him to be a perfect ""loving"" husband. 

I wouldn't call Amy the villain cause Nick isn't the protagonist. The book tells both of their stories side by side. And you're not really supposed to root for Nick anymore than Amy. They're both smug assholes, and the book and movie make that clear. Nick doesn't seem as bad cause he wasn't trying to break Amy down. He wasn't trying at all. He wasn't trying to love her, protect her, or even notice her. He didn't care one bit that Amy became a tortured shell of her former self. Meanwhile Amy was trying hard the whole time to please him, show him she cares in her way over the top way. She put in all the effort in their relationship and put in that same effort into breaking him down the way he broke her down.

It’s cathartic for women to watch Amy snap and see Nick, who clearly thinks he’s so smart, get outsmarted.

16gxk4w_49,16gxk4w,"Isn't it an accepted trope that to be likeable a character must repent their bad ways? Male or female?

Anyway, she is a total sociopath through and through. I think the feminist angle is just that she manipulates males by playing up to archetypes that stroke the male ego. Also, it comments on how reactionary she is, ultimately trapping herself through trying to break from roles males want of her. At no point does she think ""who am I without this conflict? Can I self actualise outside of the male gaze?""... And she kind of tries to self-actualise but finds she is not as clever or as strong as she would like to be and runs to another man she can manipulate... And ultimately traps herself at the end by believing in the fantasy of Nick's lies on TV... He was being disingenuous on TV to manipulate her and she fell for it.

It is ultimately a tragedy where no one wins and the couple are trapped in their dishonesty.

I agree with OP that is not very feminist. It comments on how women must navigate this patriarchal world.

Mostly, I think Gone Girl has much more lucid cimmentary on the themes of perception/truth/manipulation within mass media narratives. Nearly every conversation has something to say on these themes, and the structure of the film has the audience constantly rezevaluate their views of the characters. The characters are the same people all the way through, but how we feel and think about them is constantly changing as we gain new information. It's very good at deconstructing the 24hrNews cycle and media focus. If I had to study Gone Girl then I'd probably go for that angle as it is a much richer seam to delve in and you can include the feminist commentary and contextualise it with how the media uses women in specific roles with specific boundaries of behaviour, and that women who fall outside those boundaries are mis-represented and devalued.",Chip_Pan_Fire,2023-09-13T07:39:22Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,49

16gxk4w_55,16gxk4w,"No this is pretty true about the ""talking at"" part.  I've followed these conversations for years and it is astounding to be on the male side of it and be hearing the exact same things at a much older age that you were hearing before.  It doesn't matter how much YOU change, if men are abstracted you can be assumed to not know.  You sort of, understand that the women saying it and the men they're saying it to morph over the years and there's ALWAYS going to be jerk men around who don't get it so the conversation doesn't grow up.  So many conversations just are unproductive from the jump.

With Gone Girl, I think what's interesting is the Madonna/Whore dichotomy and the various roles women seem to be assigned in fiction has changed over the years but many people don't really appreciate just how much of a change it has been.   There was a period where frankly Women roles were often needing to be shown as ""better"" than the men they were on the screen with often with cliche ""interactions"" meant to show somehow the superiority or deficiency between the two characters.   But the rule tended to be, ""in a good way"".  Somehow, when you wrote that character, the character was almost always in the right.

Gone Girl is almost an adult Cruella Deville - so unrepentant and so overtly  bad and active in the story, its easy to fail to realize just how many other women characters are forced to be ""overly nuanced"" or ""secretly the victim"".  It's such a trend that both Malificent AND Cruella Deville now have live action prequels ""softening"" them.

So for me, the Feminism in the character is about going all the way to the point that you can write about anything again.  I'd I'd fully admit - it would play much differently if Gillian Flynn was an author named Bob Jones.",azzers214,2023-09-13T18:37:08Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,55

16gxk4w_57,16gxk4w,"There is no “irony” here. Feminist readings don’t require that the female protagonist is entirely unconnected to male characters. Feminist scholars have done decades of research to highlight the *many* important female characters (villains and otherwise) and female writers in literary history. Are there equal numbers? No. But that’s different than claiming that “for centuries and centuries women got to be only virgin or whore, mother or crone.” Lady MacBeth is much more complex than just her relation to MacBeth. I could go on—if you want complex female villains, Austen’s Lady Catherine DeBourgh or Thackery’s Becky Sharp are perfect. Or what about the White Witch in Narnia? Anna Karenina is a deeply flawed and yet fascinating woman, both hero and anti-hero.

16gxk4w_58,16gxk4w,"Arguably no, in real life. In fiction, female characters who display similar behaviors to standard “asshole” men characters are often punished for their behavior or treated as much worse than their male counterparts. Alternatively, some people argue that it’s not realistic to compare male “asshole” behavior 1-to-1 with women doing the same behavior, because women engage less frequently in a lot of those standard behaviors (ex. Its much less common for a woman to completely offload all emotional/mental labour onto their male partner in a heterosexual relationship, compared to the inverse dynamic). So I’ve seen some people argue that the actions of manipulative, neglectful, toxic women present differently than those of manipulative, neglectful, toxic men. Societally, a lot of the female-coded behaviors are viewed as much worse/crueller/more evil than the male-coded behaviors.

I don't think it's always good or useful and I think it can double back around on itself to become actively sexist when it's paired with objectification, but it's a trope born out of girl power, as you say.

I think you're dead right about meanness, though (although that's getting better too) but I also think there are still pretty intense taboos about the violence when you get out of the comic book genre and into the more realistic.

The Killer Inside Me and Pop. 1280 by Thompson are probably some of the finest examples of this kind of story ever written, even if they’re kind of the same book. Patricia Highsmith, an obvious influence on Gillian Flynn, had her most famous creation fall under this umbrella, too - Tom Ripley from The Talented Mr. Ripley and other novels. Modern examples could include things like the movie Nightcrawler, the novel The Butcher Boy, maybe Breaking Bad, and definitely Gone Girl, at least the sections from Amy’s POV.

In her journal, which is mostly false, but theres no reason to doubt this next bit, she says that when she meets Nick at the party, he would be the 12th man she would be with. Of course, they dont end up together until months later. Nick finds out that in these months, she sees another man (the guy whom she sets up to accuse of rape). Meaning that other guy is #12. Meaning that Nick is #13. Unlucky number 13.

Thoroughly enjoyed Gone Girl, as well as Gillian Flynns other two novels which I read after Gone Girl. I almost stopped Gone Girl before the telling of Amys diary finished because I was getting bored.

3d1g6e_9,3d1g6e,"Gone Girl is the most polished novel of the three. There is a very common style that the three share, and it almost seems like the first two were practice for Gone Girl, which was written most recently. So GG would be #1.

Thennnnnn... Dark Places #2, Sharp Objects #3. DP probably has the most ""problems"", but the story and characters are more compelling. SO, if it can be said to have one, has a better moral. Without giving anything away, the moral could be the cycle of self-harm: infliction of pain, suffering, healing. You cut, you hurt, then you clean the wound, bandage and heal. I read a couple reviews before I read SO and it was common to see that the book made people want to self-harm. I disagree, but I am someone with my own self-harm habit. I dont cut, I forget the word for what I do, but I think its what Natalie Portman does in Black Swan (I havent seen the movie, only heard about it), but I tear the skin around my nails. So to an extent, I can personally relate to and understand SO. (EDIT: Just want to say that I am working very hard to stop this habit I have, but its a ten year habit and I find that I often do it subconsciously. But I'm working on it.)


However... I still rank it third because it just plain wasnt as satisfying as DP. And neither were, in my opinion, as satisfying as GG. Still good, but obvious that the *quality* of writing just isnt as good. Flynn grew as a writer, as an author,  by writing SO and DP. I would recommend reading SO first, DP second, and GG third, if you haven't read any of them yet. ",colmatterson,2015-07-13T02:43:25Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,9

Then Sharp Objects.. It took me awhile to get through this book, I believed it dragged on a bit and not as many surprises as Flynn's other two novels. I actually told a friend not to bother reading it and just read the other two novels by Flynn because the lack of surprises.

I found the ending to be in-line with her other novels.

It's something that had bothered me for a while, but I'd never seen anybody articulate it so well before that -- I absolutely adored the section in the book where you describe it (while feeling increasingly uncomfortable as the book went on after that that I identified with Amy in any way, heh.

23ojta_6,23ojta,"Good morning, Gillian! I loved Gone Girl, devoured it in two days - Amy's journal chapters in particular captivated me, there's something so voyeuristic about reading another person's personal diary. I was wondering what went into writing Amy vs. writing Nick - especially as her journal entries change so drastically mid-book once we get the first big reveal. Did you write the chapters more or less sequentially, or were Amy's journal/POV chapters a very separate writing process you later integrated in between Nick's chapters? Was Amy's voice difficult to capture, especially since she was one person writing/presenting herself as another for a good portion of her POV entries?",arbitraryarchivist,2014-04-22T15:41:38Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,6

I'm Brazilian and not fluent at all, but I'm a big fan, and I'm really obsessed with your work. :-) Do you also consider ""Gone Girl"" your master piece? I thought ""Sharp Objects"" was also great, very thrilling, cathartic about motherhood and growing up in small town and being a girl (in Brazil, we have our own Wind Gap). But ""Gone Girl"" is already a classic. An epic book, with mythological value. A real fairy tale about marriage. Such an amazing reading. Do you see Amy as a sort of archetype? I really believe every woman identify with her in some level. It is truly magnificent to create a character so absurd and yet so close to us. Someone who reminds us of our own deepest lights and shadows. You're remarkable. <3

I'm really excited to see your AMA--I teach literature at a local college, and I literally just finished teaching *Gone Girl* last Friday. My students greatly enjoyed it, though many were upset at the ending (they really want people to be punished for their bad actions--poor naive kids). 

Your book was a great addition to my class, and I hope that other people are teaching it--very fun, lots of great conversations about structure and craft. 

My two questions are these: 

- How far into the planning/writing of *Gone Girl* were you when the ending fell into place? 

- Dashiell Hammett or Raymond Chandler? Laurie King or Patricia Cornwall? (Sorry that's a double question--I hope you don't mind.)

23ojta_12,23ojta,"There's a long history of putting social criticism in a villain's mouth. (For example, the most cutting critique of sexism in Westeros comes from Cersei Lannister, a villain.) In *Gone Girl*, [Amy](/spoiler) makes an amazingly bitter and cutting critique of sexism, but she's a *villain*. So people can choose to swallow her critique or not; she's either saying something daring and incisive or she's just a crazy bitch.

This reads to me as... sketchy, especially when you then write your villains not as their own kind of villain, but as strawmen built by people who hate (in this case) women. Having a woman whose methods of doing evil include [pregnancy scares, false rape accusations and eventually *spermjacking*](/spoiler) reads like someone from /r/MensRights drew a picture of what they think a woman is like. It's roughly as insulting as having a black villain who defrauds the government for welfare money, manipulates white liberal guilt for cynical profit, beats up gentiles at the behest of his Jewish masters, and rapes white women. It takes one stereotype--the Manic Pixie Dream Girl--and cleverly subverts it by turning her into *another* stereotype, [the man-eating witchy feminazi hag](/spoiler).

I suppose I didn't really have a question; I just wanted to say that. The book certainly got a reaction out of me; I think it's the third time ever that reading a book has made me angry at *the author*. You're not going to please everyone, but you did have enough of a reaction on me that when I saw the post, I had to come here and write this. (The first two angry-making books were Mark Millar's *Kick-Ass* and Chester Brown's *Paying for It*.)",grendel-khan,2014-04-22T16:28:42Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,12
23ojta_13,23ojta,"Hello Gillian, firstly, I would just like to thank you for your books- Sharp Objects, Dark Places and Gone Girl. You are absolutely one of my favourite authors. When I completed all three books, a part of me felt empty, like something is missing and can't be replaced. And I have not felt that for a very long time, about a lot of things. So, thank you, for the characters that are so real, and for me, even somehow likable. 

People are not black or white, the grey matters, and that's what I find in your characters. So brilliantly portrayed by you. I have to mention, Dark Places is my special favourite. And your perfect sketch of ""Cool Girl"" in Gone Girl, is by far, the most cleverly expressed in words. I love Sharp Objects too. 

Your wit delights me to no end, and I simply cannot wait for your next novel, since nothing seems to fill that emptiness.

23ojta_14,23ojta,"Hi Ms Flynn.

My SO had read Gone Girl for a book club a while ago. I read it for the first time a few months ago. She was amused as I talked to her about the book as I was reading it. About halfway through I began drawing parallels between Nick and Amy's relationship and our own, and she got a little disturbed. I actually called the framejob pretty early on, but still found that we were very similar in a lot of aspects.

It amuses me that so many people are horrified at the characters. I find that they're characters who are very loveable. They're both fairly extreme, but they've managed to find each other, balancing each other's neuroses. I feel that the only alternatives to what they have are destroying two other people, being alone, or being incarcerated. 

So I guess thank you for creating a narrative where we see an oasis in a desert of normalcy. I appreciate having a reference for how to make peace with my inner demons.",martin_grosse,2014-04-22T16:52:32Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,14

23ojta_16,23ojta,"YES! I've been waiting for this AMA since I finished Gone Girl.
I read Gone Girl just because I saw you were doing an AMA, and it ended up being so captivating and thrilling that I couldn't put it down. I was endlessly annoyed each time my ebook app made me take a sixty second rest for healthy eyes. When I was reading, I couldn't help but hate Amy but relate to her at once. When she was so self-pitying, it was like I was reading notes from my own diary. As the story fleshed out and Amy became more apparently psychotic, I can only say it was a personal journey for me and I evolved as a person after finishing your book, so thank you for that.

I am excited to hear a movie is being made, and that you wrote the screenplay. Since the book is in a back-and-forth format between perspectives and one half of the first part is a ""creative-retelling.""  I can't wait to see how it translates to the screen.

My questions: what was your writing process for this book? Did you write Nick's parts first then later fill in intermittent diary entries from Amy, or did you do it in sequence? Also, how long did it take for you to write the book- from the time the idea popped into your head to when it was time to start publishing?

Also, how was the process for writing the movie different from writing the book?

Did you deliberately set out to write her character to provoke self examination for the reader or was it a by-product of the character's own self awareness?",,2014-04-22T18:50:28Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,54

I'm curious about this: When you write morally grey characters, for instance characters with sociopathic tendencies does it exhaust you mentally or does it have a therapeutic effect?

Also, I'm wondering which one of your characters you would rather be friends with in real life and who you think you wouldn't get along with? ",Farrowes,2014-04-22T19:16:46Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,56

When you write the characters, do you base their appearance on real people, actors, your friends, family, neighbours etc?

Is Sharp Objects going to be adapted?

I've read Sharp Objects and Dark Places several times each, but Gone Girl only the once. It's just as brilliantly written but I found the characters unlikable enough as to feel I was finishing the book out of obligation =(. I'm sorry. I know many of your characters are not meant to be Mary Sue perfect people and I love that, I love that they're flawed. But the character from Gone Girl made me just kind of want them both to die =(

You write damaged/dangerous children very, very well. Is there a reason why you focus on kids, and on the characters as kids?

Do you plan any more stories featuring dangerous/broken kids?

23ojta_106,23ojta,"Hi! Thank you! Last year was all about the Gone Girl screenplay, so I am only just now leaving GoneGirlworld and having room in my brain to start the next novel. It is a big, sprawling American folkloric tale of murder. I also, oddly enough, am doing a YA novel after that. No vampires. As for unlikable characters: I've always said I don't mind if a character isn't likable as long as he or she is understandable. Do I get why these people are doing the awful things they do? I think that's why I often include backstories about childhood—if you understand what circumstances or people created a person, I think you have more empathy. And humor. Libby Day, Nick and Amy Dunne—they do awful things, but they're very self-aware and fairly funny at times. I think you can forgive a lot if a person make you laugh (even if you know you shouldn't be laughing).",gillianflynn,2014-04-22T15:20:16Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,106

You write in whatever way gets the job done for you. I personally don't outline: That would take the fun out of it for me. I like to spend a lot of time on my characters, figuring out who they are and what led them to whatever awful situation I've put them in. For Gone Girl, I knew Nick and Amy had to be very believable, so I made ipod playlists for them, and knew their netflix queues. I wrote scenes of them in childhood from other people's points of view: A scene of Amy in highschool, written from her friend's POV, or Nicks kindergarten teacher writing about parent-teacher conference night. Stuff I knew I'd never use, but would help me flesh them out. I do that a lot when I've hit a writer's block--it keeps me writing and sometimes helps solve a problem. Amy's Cool Girl speech started as a writing exercise, but that one I liked so much I kept it for the book. Once I have a first draft, then the actual real work for me begins, because then I can see the novel as a whole and see what needs work. I do tons of rewriting; it's where the book becomes a book.

pm51mp_2,pm51mp,"Somehow I had managed to remain in blissful ignorance of Gillian Flynn's body of work until one day when I was walking back from the library with my sister, who had just borrowed out a copy of *Gone Girl.* She told me she had reserved the copy because David Fincher was making a film based on it, and gave me a loose synopsis of the first act of the book (wife gone missing, her side told through diary entries, everyone suspects the husband).

After hearing this I then mention ""oh it's probably-"" and ended up describing exactly what happens in the book, because, to me, it was the most obvious twist someone could write with that setup.

I still ended up really enjoying the book. Especially the characters (I maintain Nick is just as much a sociopath as Amy, just in a much more subtle way). My biggest complaint is that the last act of the book is resolved far too quickly, and involves some suspense-stretching contrivances to work out, though I do love the ending.

I (30 y/o man) definitely am reading it as a cautionary tale, but as a *what not to do* when marital problems arise. I see a *lot* of my past self in Nick and it’s definitely difficult being confronted with it. 

I also have experience working in the criminal Justice system and it’s definitely an indictment of the media when it comes to true crime (ie there’s no longer such a thing as an untainted jury). Cable news, Nancy Grace types, certain podcasts, and social media create an environment where a fair trial is impossible and it’s not particularly an arguable point anymore. 

Like I said, I’m only halfway through but Flynn does a great job of making the reader *want* to dislike almost every character so far (except Go) but we feel ourselves sort of “rooting” for certain characters depending on our perspectives.

3bhdxl_1,3bhdxl,"""The next *Gone Girl*"" seems to have been the most popular marketing gimmick for a lot of books in the past few years. Psychologically twisty books in that vein, most of which I enjoyed reading:

*Dark Places* and *Sharp Objects* by Gillian Flynn (obviously)

*The Silent Wife* by A.S.A. Harrison (another twisted marriage)

*The Good Girl* by Mary Kubica (the ending will make you hate the author)

*Reconstructing Amelia* and *Where They Found Her* by Kimberly McCreight (very similar in tone with Gillian Flynn's works)

*Everything I Never Told You* by Celeste Ng (light on plot, heavy on twisted family dynamics)


And some twisty works that were written pre-*Gone Girl*:


*Notes on a Scandal* by Zoe Heller (probably the best book of all of these, on par with *Gone Girl*)

*What the Dead Know* by Laura Lippman 

*In the Woods* by Tana French

*Before I Go to Sleep* by S.J. Watson

But once the tedium of real life hit, and it was no longer fun, she was lost. Then his infidelity surfaced. She got pissed. I mean, in her mind, she married down. Then he cheated on her? That’s when the psychopathic behavior rears it’s very ugly head. Don’t get me wrong. She’s awful! But I found the book more nuanced. Also, the extent to which she goes to in order to “win” is insane.

Dark Places is (edit, got it mixed up with the third, Sharp something) — an exploration of childhood trauma set to the background of farm foreclosures and the Satanic Panic.

2kh4t4_4,2kh4t4,"Okay, but in addition to movies that both capture the tone/impact of the source and play it so close to the original that they're practically interchangeable, like Gone Girl, there are movies based on suspense novels and other books with twists that some people don't want ""ruined"" by seeing them played out onscreen before reading the novel. 

There are a lot of perfectly good movie adaptations that I wouldn't see before reading the book, just because I would rather watch the story unfold organically in novel form first (especially if it's an author I'm particularly attached to). 

This is especially true for serial film franchises - read the books first or live in fear of spoilers for years in between film releases (not to mention half the fun of those franchises is the anticipation and discussion, which you have to either cut yourself off from or resign yourself to hearing all about secondhand from those who read the books early). 

Watching the movie *always* before reading the book might work for you, but I really don't think it's applicable here in the case of Gone Girl, which OP was specifically asking about, or as a general rule of thumb for movie adaptations. ",,2014-10-27T19:08:18Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,4

The story is very good in itself, but especially Amy's chapters drive home so much of the basics to flirting, getting together, living together, etc, I felt like I was learning so much while reading. Of course, Amy is a neurodivergent person, a sociopath, and her view on things shouldn't always be taken at face value, but there's still much of the truth in them. 

Gillian Flynn's other books are also great, but in a different way. I'd recommend them, but none of them has left me speechless like Gone Girl did.",athousandships_,2019-12-30T11:42:27Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,1

5eadpk_1,5eadpk,"I really loved the book. Now people call it ""overhyped"" because that's what people tend to do when something becomes popular—but I think it was hyped for good reason. 

It wasn't the first book to feature a dangerous, dark woman but it *was* the first to do it so openly and unabashedly in modern times—and I love that. Have you read Gillian Flynn's quote for why she writes such dark female characters? It's more of a mini-essay but it's wonderful and I heartily agree with her. Most of us women aren't as dark as her characters, of course, but we're also not the sympathetic ""flawed roses"" that many authors make us out to be. I loved that the story explored the rage of women (expressed through one woman and her thoughts). I said this recently in another thread, but I think many women can relate a lot to Amy: the fury and despair over feeling like they always have to be perfect, that if they don't kow-tow to a guy they're suddenly a ""shrew,"" or ""harpy,"" or ""bitch,"" and the ugly realization that society (and men) often see them as objects to be ""traded for a younger, prettier model.""

Yes, Amy was a sociopath and no, most women are not sociopaths—but Amy's thoughts on gender, and male vs female dynamics had a lot of truth and merit to them. I believe the Cool Girl stereotype is true; women are often pressured to act dumb, like sports, drink beer, and other such guy-ish things so they can seem like ""they can hang,"" and ""they're one of the dudes, a really *cool* chick""—oh, but they also have to be hot. But I don't really see as much pressure on men to be hot *as well as* watching romantic-comedies, going to spas with women, and enjoying shopping. I'm not saying there's no pressure on men at all, but way less of it. After all, a girl who drinks beer to please her man is a ""cool chick"" but a guy who watches Fashion Week shows to please his girl would be called ""whipped"" or ""a pussy, come on dude! You're watching fashion shows just so she can like you?! Where are your balls, man?"" 

I think you guys get my point. 

Both Amy and Nick were awful people. I think the difference is, Amy's nastiness bloomed in much darker, dangerous ways because girls aren't allowed to express rage as openly. She fel stifled, unwanted, and made to feel like a toy doll her whole life and this messed her up. But as long as her husband pretended to be perfect along with her, she'd act normal. When Nick decided to ruin the perfect persona by being, well, lazy and a cheater and a flawed human—well, I think Amy's rage was justifiable. It's not fair, is it, that she was expected to pretend to be perfect her whole life...but her husband could get away with ruining his act? 

The murder, obviously, is not justifiable. Nor are the actual crimes she committee. It's just her anger I get. 

Nick was terrible. I feel like he pales in comparison to Amy's violence but when you *look* at him, he was a terrible guy: a cheater, unwilling to communicate with his wife, petulant, a penchant to blame everyone else for his issues, misogynistic in his thoughts... He was a piece of shit. 

And ultimately, I don't think Gillian Flynn set out with the goal of creating a feminist novel. But I think in writing a female character that so few authors dare to, and really tapping into her world, and making certain observations about gender and sex and violence...she kind of inadvertently created a feminist book. I see nothing wrong with that. 

And I loved the ending. It was so frustrating but I love that the author *went there.* Cause in real life, sometimes our endings are unhappy and ugly. 

Sorry for the essay, I just have a lot of thoughts about Gone Girl lol. ",RomanovaRoulette,2016-11-22T16:48:02Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,1

2j0bf0_1,2j0bf0,"The most troubling thought to me about the ending to Gone Girl is the inevitable fate of their son.

Amy does not impregnate herself out of love, but out of self-preservation. When the son starts behaving in a way that does not satisfy that need any longer, I imagine that Amy would simply set up the son in order to destroy him.

You can make the argument that the fate of the principal characters was brought on by themselves (except for the victims of Amy's lies from her past). If Nick doesn't cheat, Amy doesn't frame him for her murder. If Amy had planned/protected her escape better (not talked to Greta), she would not have had to call Desi. If Desi had not acted like a creepy weirdo prison warden, Amy would not have stabbed him.

But the son has no control in this. For those who don't have kids, they look to their parents for love and guidance, and they do not understand, particularly at an early age, the consequences of their actions. What bothers me most is that Amy would likely punish him regardless of that fact. Beyond all else, I can't imagine her treating him with love, and that's just so tragic.

For Gillian Flynn, it was a really smart way to give Amy a way out, but it opened many more dissatisfying thoughts for me around the son's fate.

She wrote the script for GONE GIRL herself, and I think in collaboration with David Fincher she really honed in on the meat of the story in a way that it amplified the almost trashy, pitch-black comedy elements in a way that really worked cinematically. I’m aware that it’s very streamlined compared to the novel, but I think that works in its favor because it becomes this hyper-focused, hilariously bleak polemic on American marriage, basically. It’s not trying to be this sprawling mystery, it’s just becomes this funny and mean thriller and it packs way more of a punch. And the actual filmmaking itself is superb and Fincher is just totally in tune with the script Flynn wrote.

Generally I just think it’s a more powerful and satisfying movie experience than it is a reading experience. That’s not a knock on the book, which is very good, but the movie is *great* - as its own thing. ",,2018-08-21T06:57:46Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,2

2ezdrd_1,2ezdrd,"There was one chapter where the end where Nick realized that he couldn't live without Amy despite the horrible things she'd done....that was where the book lost me.  It was an amazing book, believe me there, but the end was fucked up.  The twists built up upon each other to something so horrifying...and the worst part was that I didn't know who to root for in the end.  Hell, most of the way through the book I was going back and forth between Nick and Amy.

I've heard that the other two books by Gillian Flynn are a lot better than Gone Girl, so I'd probably give them both a good try",Laurotica,2014-08-31T02:59:35Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,1
2ezdrd_2,2ezdrd,I was just talking about this today! I loved reading gone girl and sharp objects because of the roles female played. They were all so multi-layered and it was so scary that you could relate and sympathize with them at one moment and absolutely despise them a second later. I finished sharp objects last night and have not been able to stop thinking about it!,cartsandrafts,2014-08-31T06:03:36Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,2

3xrxte_1,3xrxte,"After reading and watching Gone Girl, I'll say that the book is great. I feel like the movie moved too fast with Nick putting things together, which made it feel a little less believable but is understandable due to time. The book, on the other hand, gradually builds you up to the situation and is really engaging. Up to you, but I feel like reading the book is worth it too!",,2015-12-22T01:27:41Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,1
3xrxte_2,3xrxte,"SPOILERS: 

I knew the twist before I started reading Gone Girl bc of a friend (but the movie wasnt a thing yet). And I still really enjoyed Gone Girl! Amy has her ""I'm alive"" reveal in the middle of the book. So you'll lose that. You'll lose some of the surprise of the other plot points as well, but I think the book will really solidify the characters and how almost perfect Amy's plan was. 

I think some things the movie misses are: 

- Why did Nick stay? The movie, to me, made it a little confusing why he stayed. The book showed a little more of the relationship with his father. 

- Amy seems a bit smarter and Nick seems a bit dumber in the book. 

- I thought the cop was perfectly cast. The cop chick was my favorite side character in the book!

Just my opinion but I think the book is worth a read! It will color the movie! 

If you like Gone Girl, might I also suggest You by Caroline Kepnes? 

happy reading. ",nikiverse,2015-12-22T14:56:43Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,2

It was another amazing page turner that I would highly recommend. 
I love her style of writing and her ability to make you not want to put the book down. 

And as always with her book I won't say anything about the book so as not to spoil anything.

2yht1i_1,2yht1i,"Okay, so... Gone Girl is interesting because (kind of like the film) you read from both of the main characters perspectives and what's cool about that is that you only know as much as they tell you. The whole book is set up to make you really dislike Nick which I thought was unusual and gripping because there seemed to be really nothing in him worth supporting especially when his chapters are intercut with whole pages from Amy's diary which is filled with a character you (as a reader) can relate to, you laugh with her and sympathise and obviously once her true character is revealed and you come to know  that she's alive and the whole intended purpose of the diary is to make the reader fall in love with her you snap because you realise you fell for it!  The jokes on you and suddenly the tables turn and you find yourself in the same shoes as Nick, feeling betrayed by her and hurt, almost embarrassed that you fell for the ""cool girl"" Amy Dunne. So aside from the format the writing itself is actually brilliant, its quirky and descriptive and totally relatable which is why, in my opinion, it gets you so hard when you fall for these set traps in the story. Obviously some of the characters are more fleshed out in the book but actually I was surprised at how much they fit into the movie and how well they did in keeping true to the book. Themes wise I think you'll find theres a bit more going on in the book than in the film, the film for obvious reasons had to be a slightly simplified version of the book but like I said before I think you'll be surprised at how well they adapted it... i think that mostly comes from Gillian herself adapting the screenplay. SO all in all I recommend the book as a good read, knowing the plot/seeing the movie won't massively affect the enjoyment of the book its still a thing of greatness BUT if you don't want to or decide not to I urge you to read anything else written by Gillian Flynn, I've read everything she's written and they're all fantastic. Hope this helps, sorry if it doest I'm fucking tired.

TL;DR: The film is a great adaptation but the book is still worth a read.",mickeyunlikethemouse,2015-03-09T23:06:18Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,1
2yht1i_2,2yht1i,"My problem with GoT-books is that there are some characters that i care more about than others, and some characters that i despise. I get irritated (hence don't enjoy those chapters) that i don't read anything about my favorite characters in for half a book.    The story is more fragmented in the books, imo. In the series it's easier for me to handle.

However, Gone Girl is much better in book than in the movie, IMO.",,2015-03-11T07:38:31Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,2
2ikl9x_1,2ikl9x,Well The Martian isn't a huge blockbuster like Gone Girl (I believe in sci fi it was) but it's getting made into a movie by big time director Ridley Scott and will star Matt Damon.

It's a little creepy/supernatural, though, which Gone Girl wasn't.

2be2rp_1,2be2rp,"I wasnt picturing NPH as Desi but when I saw the casting, I totally got it. And the hispanic cop woman (its been awhile since I read it so I dont know her name) ... exactly what I was picturing in my head! So Im excited about the movie. I wonder if they're going to switch up the ending though ... assuming enough people have read the books. 

I have also picked up two other Gillian Flynn books so we'll see how that goes! Sharp Objects annnnnnd somethign else. 

I like reading books that are going to be movies! I am pretty sure that's why I keep reading books like Twilight, Divergent, and Hunger Games :/


Anyways, I really liked Gone Girl as well. And I love that ""cool girl"" schpeel she goes on ... This is just the first part of the quote: 

>Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.",nikiverse,2014-07-22T13:49:13Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Gone Girl,1

It is pretty good, it's written in the form of a diary, if that interests you.

If referring to a book as the next Gone Girl, encourages people to pick up another book and read, that's fine by me!

Have you read The Good Girl or any Tana French?
