2bept2_1,2bept2,Fight Club isn't a good story to tack a sequel onto. Very skeptical.,,2014-07-22T17:12:01Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,1
2bept2_2,2bept2,"Skeptical. After reading his last few hastily put together novels, I fear the man who wrote Fight Club is no more",totallychadical,2014-07-22T16:58:54Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,2
2bept2_3,2bept2,"Okay, I'll be downvoted into oblivion for this, but the man can do whatever he likes with his own story. Chuck Palahniuk created this universe inside of his own mind, and if he feels like writing down some more of his stories based in the Fight Club universe, by all means let the man do what he wants with the time he has left in his life. Sometimes its hard to tell that a story like Fight Club came from the mind of another person like Chuck Palahniuk, and readers tend to claim 'ownership' onto the story they interpreted. Chuck Palahniuk can honestly just be spewing out bullshit to make a few extra bucks, or Chuck Palahniuk is simply 'publishing' the rest of his Fight Club saga for his readers to enjoy. It's up to you whether you want to read the graphic novel or not, but it's most definitely up to Chuck Palahniuk whether he wants to write the damn thing. 

tl;dr: Chuck Palahniuk can do what he wants with the story he created.",,2014-07-22T22:27:03Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,3

2bept2_64,2bept2,"I think you are reading way too much into that statement, and, perhaps, projecting a little. 

I got a very different impression from that same line. Like many writers or artists, Palahniuk tends to have a few things going at once. Some ideas simmer and sit on a back burner for years before they reach anything near being presented to an audience. It isn't always a process of finishing one book and moving on to the next in sequence like checking off a list. Sometimes pieces incubate for a long time, while other projects take center stage. 

>For years, Palahniuk considered Fight Club finished in his mind. But he began to revisit it while getting sucked into the Portland, Ore., comic-book community and thinking about the writing.

I think it is clear this is something that he has been ruminating on for many years and gradually developing the concept while working on other books. But once it got mentioned in public and ""the cat is out of the bag"", suddenly now there is pressure from fans to get something tangible down.  It doesn't mean it is rushed, it just means that it helped move it to the forefront instead of sitting on a back burner for a few more years.

2bept2_67,2bept2,"*Invisible Monsters* is an interesting take on the ""twist"" ending because you know how it ends from the very beginning. 

Essentially it starts at the bizarre violent ending, then goes back to the beginning and you  piece together how it got to that bizarre violent ending, only it turns out the ending isn't quite what you really thought it was the first time around. 

>For a while he sustained that, but he never managed to evolve and the writing just got worse and lazier.

He has experimented with a lot of unique ways of telling a story and presenting a novel, and I consider that the opposite of lazy and a very conscious effort to evolve. Lazy writing is copying a successful formula over and over again (Dan Brown, John Grisham, Patterson, Clancy, etc).  Sequels are generally pretty lazy (for Damned as well Fight Club), I'll grant that, but for the most part he tries to be innovative and unique. He seems to alternate back and forth. 

Whether or not it actually works is a different story. For example, I thought Pygmy was his worst book, but it must have been tough to write. Rant is kinda hard to follow, but the structure would have made it like assembling a 20,000 piece puzzle from scratch, after you draw the image and cut it into pieces and mix them all up.  People focus on the dark and disturbing aspects of Haunted, but for me it was more interesting that he came up with a way to tell the story/stories that it completely unique. He managed to combine a short story collection with a mystery novel with some poetry thrown in and somehow it actually worked, despite sounding like an incongruous mess.

Aside from Fight Club, I loved that he would pick that weirdest subjects/premises to write about. The scam in Choke is one of the most oddball things I've ever read, to say nothing of the struggle to be the bigger martyr in Haunted.  Speaking of Haunted, for anyone who read the story of the person who was effectively disemboweled by a pool drain, that's a real thing that happened to at least one person. Look up the Virginia Graeme Bake act. I was a pool operator in county park at the time and we ended up having to completely change the main drains in the pool to prevent it from happening.

It seems it follows far more after the movie than the book.  The book clearly has ""Jack"" (and I loath to use that name because it's not the narrators)  either [in an insane asylum, or more likely in Heaven.](/spoilers)

But beyond that, people who think it's not a cash grab, the story is over, I mean it was a beyond complete thought ""oh he waited years it's not a cash grab"" he waited til he was intellectually out of other ideas. 

I mean it's his characters he can do what he wants with it, but this is just him kind of changing a book to try to make more money off of it.  To me Fight club was a near perfect book, I can't imagine coming to a graphic novel and saying ""this was necessary"".

Then, a mere three years of milking the franchise (with streaming miniseries, comics and novelized knock-offs) later, theaters will run *FIGHT CLUB IN 3-D.* 

Then, you can go and check it out on opening night. You'll get to stand in line and listen to kids talk a bunch of shit about the played-out, faux-subversive, cash cow that old people like that you're about to pay forty bucks to see.

Just kidding.

We won't have any theaters left in 2019.

Edit: I see I'm getting downvoted. Just to clarify: It's not that I *only* think this is a naked cash-grab on the part of an author who's run out of ideas, but I *also* think it's the next logical step for a writer who's clung to such a minimal style over the years. His novel was basically a screenplay to begin with.

Edit #2: I'm honestly curious: Would someone who thinks his style is particularly good care to share a paragraph from *Fight Club?*

1itilp_31,1itilp,"Fight Club is much more than its twist. The difference, for example, between Fight Club and the movie The Sixth Sense, is the former has enough drive and suspense in the plot that you can re-read it many times and still get much of the same enjoyment. The latter is really famous only for its twist and never quite the same after.

In essence, anybody curious enough to read this sequel should be prepared to not have the first book's twist strung out into a gimmick.

Essentially, even as a sequel to the film, Tyler's vision of apocalypse in the wake of Financial collapse would never be met, as the real life events of September 2001 and onwards prove, and the story's setting (10 years on from the end of Fight Club) gives a lot of room for both endings to be worked into account.",,2013-07-23T10:14:07Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,35

1itilp_42,1itilp,"Well, when you watch/read it for the first time, you think that it's about two different persons, you're drawn in and you go with it. 
In the end you find out it's actually two minds in one person and it blows your mind.

Now imagine watching Fight Club for the first time. 

But this time, you get introduced to the alter ego situation in the beginning.
That would suck. I couldn't take him serious because why would he become an anarchist just because his life sucks. Just stop being a pussy and deal with it. It'd still be interesting but not epic.

Tyler as an individual made it possible and ""took me as the viewer/reader by the hand"" to introduce a completely different environment, a big change, not a character stepping out of its comfort zone but getting dragged out of it by the feet and thrown into his personal wilderness.
Tyler is some kind of outside influence, what's happening doesn't seem to be in Jack's hands. He just follows along but he gets accustomed to it. And i didn't question it. Not one bit. It made kind of sense to me. He's got nothing to lose, nowhere to go so why not give Tyler a call? Doesn't really matter for him what happens next, let's just see where it goes.

Fight Club is still one of the best movies/books of all time but you can only watch it once for the first time, the second time you know.
It was the alter ego for me. It circled in the middle and everything adjusted around it. Knowing and not knowing about it is just too much of a difference for me. 

I need something to make up for that .

1itilp_43,1itilp,"Well to me the problem is more. Fight club is self destructive, he actually says that a number of ways and it leads to Project Mayhem, because why destroy each other when you can destroy corporate art.  

The book is more talking about the failed American dream and what we were vastly racing towards, but at the same time admitting he nor anyone else has an answer. 

Heck in 1996 we had rising crime problems if you remember, and Fight clubs actually might have been a good solution for a time, but also might have produced project mayhem. 

I actually know many people who are well off today, but are completely disillusioned, they are stuck in their well paying jobs but can never go higher.   In fact a few of them could definitely use a fight club just to feel invigorated again, but the book pretty much says (not actually quoting) 'while this might work, it's not really an answer, it's just misdirecting what you're feeling.

On top of all this, he has no likeable or believeable characters (from what I've seen, admittedly I've only read Fight Club and Lullaby). That's not necessarily a bad thing, but when there's nothing else to make the book enjoyable I consider it a negative.

However, once you’ve demonstrated that you’re so mentally ill or so violent that you cannot be trusted around society, you lose privileges. And if it has actually been found by a psychologist or rehabilitation expert (this person should also be a psychologist), then take away whatever books are necessary to maintain ordered and passive behavior. Frankly, I’m not convinced. I suspect just some disconnected chode appointed by Jared kushner or a backwards governor decided to ban these books. But if it’s necessary, they should be allowed to do it. Another right you lose in prison is the ability to go on spring vacation to Guam, and to found a shampoo company.

Vacation home may not be “can have fight club.” But neither is not letting you read fight club a cruel and unusual punishment. Lmfao. Go read any of the other thousands of brilliant novels that have nothing to do with violent rebellion and succumbing to mental delusions.

It literally doesn't work though? Like carceral and punitive justice don't prevent recidivism and actually cause it, causing worse outcomes for convicts and communities? It's cyclical, keeping prisoners in, in large part due to financial incentives? It's isn't necessary, just evil.

Palahniuk has become a 'better' and much more caustic writer (Haunted and Choke are both offside classics), but I sense his prose will never be as febrile, his vision as singular, as it was when he wrote Fight Club.

Christopher S.

The same feelings that led to his depression led to his insomnia, because he was stressed out constantly, the most common form of insomnia, why his doctor tells him to get more excorcise.

His depression created Tyler and his insomnia made him able to act it out.

Interestingly too, in an interview with Stewart, he mentional that Palahniuk was incredibly eager to re-write the material to better suit the comic medium once Stewart had produced some sample work. Its really interesting to hear of a writer, with little comic book experience, be so willing to work so closely with the artist and be willing to develop a language that will work for the both of them instead of just handing him the writing and leaving him to it. 

I'm confident it will be a really strong comic, and I think the comic book medium is perfect for the style of Fight Club. I'm really excited about it!

>What are your feelings about the movie version of Fight Club?

>>The first time I saw dailies of the movie was when I went down to the film's location, and David Fincher would drag me off the set to his trailer to show me dailies. He would be watching me for my reaction, and I had little or no idea where these scenes fit together. Here were these wonderful reaction shots and things like that which seemed so random, beautifully composed, attractive and funny in their own way, but I had no idea how they went together. I felt so self-conscious with David watching me. Now that I see the movie, especially when I sat down with Jim Uhls and record a commentary track for the DVD, I was sort of embarrassed of the book, because the movie had streamlined the plot and made it so much more effective and made connections that I had never thought to make. There is a line about ""fathers setting up franchises with other families,"" and I never thought about connecting that with the fact that Fight Club was being franchised and the movie made that connection. I was just beating myself in the head for not having made that connection myself.   [source](http://www.dvdtalk.com/interviews/chuck_palahniuk.html)

That's not exactly the same as simply saying, ""the movie was better."" Fincher didn't make a better version of *Fight Club*, he just made a few improvements upon Palahniuk's version of *Fight Club*. I think the distinction is significant, and it acknowledges that he stayed very true to the voice and tone of the original while finding ways to streamline the plot and make it more viable for a motion picture format.

10sp7zt_1,10sp7zt,"That’s an interesting way to interpret it, but I don’t think there’s much textual evidence for it one way or the other. What I see more is that the Narrator is trying to find himself (metaphorically and eventually, literally) and trying to make decisions about what kind of man he is. That’s the primary angst of the book — the Narrator doesn’t know what he wants, all he knows is what he doesn’t want and Fight Club gives him a way to self-define through that negative lens. That ties into his relationship with his father, because he doesn’t know what a good father is (because his dad wasn’t around and wasn’t loving or supportive), but he knows what a good father isn’t. 

That’s why the climax of the book is the narrator finally asserting himself. *Yes*, he admits, he does want Marla and have feelings for her. *No*, he will not be a part of Tyler Durden’s plans for corporate destruction. 

Notice that the critical scene, where things start to change, is when the Project Mayhem members try to erase Bob’s identity and when the Narrator firmly asserts that no, Bob was a person and now he’s dead, the Project Mayhem members are willing to grant that fine, people can have individuality, but only after they’re dead. This is when the choice is made clear to the Narrator and he decides he doesn’t want to wait until he’s dead to be himself, to claim his own identity. 

So I think the dad being a real person who is just absent is more thematically cogent for me, personally. He has to stop thinking about what he lacks (a father figure to serve as a blueprint for what kind of man he wants to be, which he eventually invents in Tyler, who he can model himself after) and start making decisions for himself, asserting his own individuality and claiming full ownership of it, instead of projecting it externally onto some kind of ubermensch.",lucy_valiant,2023-02-04T02:01:01Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,1

5i539z_1,5i539z,"You see as I interpreted fight club was about the absolute abandonment of men and masculinity by society as a whole. The lack of fatherly guidance of boys, the collapse of the family unit, and an inability to accept masculinity as it is. That kind of explains the whole part at the beginning about how he's attending a support group for men who are missing their testicles and crying all over each other. One of them even grows tits. If you don't allow masculinity to be the positive but chaotic force it is in society as a whole, then it will attempt to tear society down. This is represented in the duality of the main character who is half the relatively stoic and reluctantly along for the ride (at first at least) narrator that goes to the support group to ""See what real suffering is like,"" and half Tyler, a chaotic unstable sex fiend lunatic who wants to create a cult and destabilize the society they're living in. I dunno, that's just what I thought it was about. 
To quote the book;

If you're male and you're Christian and living in America, your father is your model for God. And if you never know your father, if your father bails out or dies or is never at home, what do you believe about God?
...
How Tyler saw it was that getting God's attention for being bad was better than getting no attention at all. Maybe because God's hate is better than His indifference.
If you could be either God's worst enemy or nothing, which would you choose?
We are God's middle children, according to Tyler Durden, with no special place in history and no special attention.
Unless we get God's attention, we have no hope of damnation or redemption.
Which is worse, hell or nothing?
Only if we're caught and punished can we be saved.

The characters in Fight Club search for meaning in their lifes. They find it in form of the Fight Clubs - but this is not portrayed as an ideal solution. It is self-indulgence. It does not lead to anything in itself, except for an increased sense of self-worth.

The members of the Club trade consumption of physical goods for the consumption of adrenaline. This mirrors the shift in society from a consumer to a post-materialist culture - but that is not necessarily a step forward. You can consume yoga courses or spiritual healing as much as you can a new tv or car.

1aeoi3r_3,1aeoi3r,"Rule one and two of Fight Club is to not talk about Fight Club. Let's break those rules and pull apart why they are important and prominent enough in the doctrine to justify their redundancy. 

Toxic masculinity isn't ""men-bad."" It is a term which refers to certain cultural norms that are associated with harm to society and to men themselves. It is understood not as a property inherent to being a male but by social conditioning heavily and predominantly applied to men. This means harmful effects stemming from conformity to certain behaviors promoted as the masculine ideals such as dominance, self-reliance, and competition. This socialization of boys in patriarchal societies often normalizes violence and as a consequence, these traits (as well as emotional repression) are correlated with increased psychological problems such as depression, increased stress, and substance abuse. In a positive feedback loop which deters seeking other models of identity or healthy outlets. Toxic masculine traits are characteristic of the unspoken code of behavior where they exist in part as a response to the harsh conditions such as a profoundly ill society. 

With that in mind, interpreting Fight Club as a deconstruction of toxic masculinity has a strong argument to be made from a critical reading. It opens on men with testicular cancer who are in a support group because they feel emasculated about how their disease relates to their identity as men. Seeking not to navigate their physical health but affirm their conditioned mental label. *""We're still men, right?""* And they are dissatisfied with this support group because, arguably, the cause of their suffering isn't being addressed. The solution not being to affirm them as men but dispel this need to adhere to this rigid concept of being a man. Because of this, they trade one support group for which also seeks to affirms they are men (adhering to the same concepts which is causing their suffering) through, among other things, violence. This solution to their ""problem"" is destructive and unsustainable. Physically. Literally. Per the reading. Project Mayhem strips autonomy and gets Bob Killed. It is not a salvation from the system but an extension of it. You are not supposed to talk about Fight Club because talking about your feelings (a toxic masculinity stigma) is how you heal and escape these patterns. Tyler even says he is not allowed to talk to Marla about him. Rules of Project Mayhem include ""trust Tyler"" (blind obedience to a strongman or adherence to the doctrine) and ""no excuses"" (no deviation or allowance for faults which others you from the ideal) which are also elements of toxic masculinity. The culture jamming cult doesn't succeed. It's petty accomplishments are nothing in the big schema. Tyler is literally going to martyr himself and Marla assists Sebastian in overcoming Tyler with help from one of the support groups. Sebastian gets institutionalized. And it is when Sebastian rejects Tyler that he is able to conceivably maintain a healthy relationship with a women he previously abused when he indulged in his toxic persona's inclinations - domestic abuse being another tenet of toxic masculinity. That Project Mayhem endures - and prophecies Tyler's return - is not indicative of their validity or eventual success. Only the deepness that the roots of destructive ideologies have within minds to the point of not allowing one to escape. 

There is also the fun meta-take on the novel as a phenomenon. Palahniuk making Fight-Club-the-book is not unlike Tyler Durden making Fight-Club-the-extracurricular-punching-group. Fight Club is a product which, when viewed as this cautionary tale of toxic masculinity, has grown beyond his control to the point it actively promotes it. Not unlike how ""snowflake"" in the novel was meant as a criticism of parents and an education system that heaped on vacuous praise but failed to adequately prepare children for the world yet it has since be co-opted to demean someone who is perceived to be a sensitive - or entitled - person. Literally intended as an impoverishment resulting from societal condition and twisted to be an insult of what is perceived as an internal weakness stemming from an intrinsic belief or property. 

Whether or not you agree with all the above, it is an interpretation with a strong thruline. 

To the point of why some people heavily push back against an alternative interpretation? Could be several reasons at play. One may be because, from this lens, it becomes a perverse self fulfilling prophecy of what the book warns about and that irony is palpable. Two may be because toxic masculinity is destructive. If a large group of people are emboldened by their interpretation that Lolita makes a compelling argument for abusing children, people will roll up their sleeves and try to diminish that cultural impact. Three may be because it *really feels like the right interpretation.* Independent of the material, I think that sort of conviction makes people passionate. In the same way I like to argue that, in the Slavoj Zizek interpretation, the iceberg is the hero of the love story in Titanic. Whether or not that is the intentional design is immaterial to the critical lens. If you said the moral of Journey to the Center of the Earth is that subterrainian races were a real existential threat, I will go to bat in a comment section about it because it feels really wrong.

This is not material for an action movie, and while the movie brings a new life, a stage, a visual strong impression of the characters, it cannot surpass the book. 

To me, the book was not just about the story. The way Palahniuk plays with words and style, is not something that can be summarized in the 2h of the movie. The book allows you to mull over sentences and really take in the perfect combination of style and concept and ideas...
Also, let's not forget about the idea itself. The concept of the fight club, the characters, the critique of our empty life(style) and their novelty is something that comes from the book.

Finally... I've read somewhere that a good book leaves the reader with the feeling that they need to change something... While a movie leaves the spectator with the illusion of having already had a change. 
This book might be for many readers a push into some sort of change (even if they do not embrace a complete revolution)... while the explosions at the end of the movie I believe left spectators with the feeling that they participated in a revolution (and obviously, it's an illusion). Somehow, even if the movie is great, it does not serve the philosophy presented by the author.",davidepi22,2020-06-16T09:19:19Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,1

There is a line about ""fathers setting up franchises with other families,"" and I never thought about connecting that with the fact that Fight Club was being franchised and the movie made that connection.

You can try to frame Fight Club in a way that appeals to the girls in your club. I don't know them, but I am pretty sure that most teenagers regardless of sex understand in a visceral way the struggle to define your identity. Fight Club definitely touches on that. You could emphasize that Fight Club is built up on a foundation of magical realism (of a sort) and that Marla is a strong, well-developed and *interesting* female character.

gorqay_2,gorqay,"I would say it's not necessarily conventionally well-written, but it's impressive that he designed this ultra-specific writing style and voice for the narrator that conveys dreaminess, detachment, and neurotic restlessness. And in my opinion, a very sympathetic sense of existential pain leaking through in the writing.

It's one of the best narrator voices ever. It's been chipped at slightly because of imitators and homages, but I can read it at any point in my life and still appreciate it. The way the scenes break and transition to the next and the feeling of time passing in this book is really unique.

I think some books create a very specific kind of impression, that the author must have been on molly or something. My favorite books personally are the ones where you can tell a lot of the writing falls ad-hoc from the writer's head onto the page, that it all came in a blur of divine inspiration. Fight Club is one of the ur-examples of this kind of book. Whereas it's far more common for books to feel like the writer really 'worked' on it, and the amount of deliberation in the writing is too obvious to create that same feeling.",BannerlordAdmirer,2020-05-22T21:34:08Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,2

Part of what attracts me to his writing is how rough it tends to be. His ideas are so manic and strange that it tends to complement them well.

However, when you are relying on the narrator to give you the information, and than narrator is unreliable, it’s almost like a betrayal of the reader. Which I love. I like the “naïf” role, when the person telling the story is too young to understand all of what is happening, but I get more satisfaction out of one like the narrator.

Movie's even better; I'm always in awe of David Fincher's directorial style... he's so very technically precise. And it's supremely interesting to see how well the book actually translated. But there's also a great deal to be said about the way Jim Uhls (the screenwriter) adapted. If you can get your hands on a DVD version and watch it with the commentary, Chuck Pahlaniuk gives Jim Uhls mad props for the ending which IS quite different. 

I really respect him for being able to say that. There's only one other adaptation where I think the movie version absolutely nailed an ending harder than the book, and that would be the 2007 version of the Mist based on Stephen King's books. Stephen King also notably said he wished he had written that ending. 

Breathtaking, really. Anyway Fight Club's been in my top 10 best all-around movies of all time since it's come out. I miss 1999, it was such a very good year.

2bbzi0_5,2bbzi0,"Once again, the WTC was one of the most famous landmarks in the US.  The WTC getting blown up in film is no more predictive than the White House or the Statue of Liberty.  As the Vice magazine picture points out, the WTC was bombed by Muslim terrorists in the early 90s.   It was a massive piece of news.  Add to this Iranians taking American hostages in the 70s and 80s as well as the First Gulf War.  Muslims attacking the US wasn't a particularly unlikely scenario, especially for fiction.   To go back to the Fight Club video, part of the 'proof' is that the words 'human sacrifices' appears.  Besides the meaning it has in the movie, it's a common phrase.      

As to your point about *The Lone Gunmen.*  Are you familiar with a novel called [*Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wreck_of_the_Titan)?  It was a pulp adventure story published in 1898 by Morgan Robertson.  It accurately predicted most of the details about the 1912 sinking of the Titanic, including the location, speed, and size, and other circumstances.  Or there's the time Edgar Allan Poe predicted a shipwreck, right down to [the name of the man who was eaten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Parker_(shipwrecked))   

You're right, it's amazing, but far from unprecedented.     

As far as the Cooper video, that's basically the astrology of conspiracy.  For one, he said three weeks, not three months.  Two, his point has one very basic problem.  He points out that a CNN camera crew found Bin Laden but the CIA couldn't. It seems more likely than anything that Bin Laden would hear that there's an American camera crew looking for him, thinks ""hm, I could get a message out to the entire US population, bring them to me"", then moves camp (or more likely meets them at a location otherwise unused.).  And when you say he was shot by police, you forget to mention that he killed one of them.

The long answer echoes what a lot of people have already said - it's a quick read, has a better ending, and the writing is incredible.  I'm an avid Chuck Palahniuk fan, and his style is incredibly fun to read.  Almost all his books are riddled with strange facts (remember when Tyler explains how soap was first made, how to make napalm, etc?) that break up the plot or stream-of-consciousness that they're embedded in,  and it makes his books fascinating.  

If you like Fight Club's style (the movie or the book), read Survivor by Chuck Palahniuk.  It's in-fucking-credible.  ",,2013-11-16T16:08:06Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,1

Fuming from this rejection he wrote Fight Club, a book designed to SHIT all over the kind of throwaway modern culture that Palahniuk blamed for editors rejecting Invisible Monsters.  It's more than a bit ironic that it became his best known work, a runaway best-seller AND hit film, popular with both regular audiences and a legitimate cult classic as well.  Through this lense I think it's easier to understand what Palahniuk was going for, .....he was writing a cynical money-grab story capitalizing on an audience of young dumb males that would be somewhat ironically attracted to the overtly homo-erotic overtones of the Fight Club itself, and not understand that Palahniuk was mocking them, and everything they stand for.

Let me stop you right there. He definitely is. Everything he does is. Fight Club starts because some people come across a guy beating himself up and think ""huh, that's interesting."" The book is absolutely an indictment of toxic masculinity because one of the main points is if someone is charismatic enough, they can manipulate a group of disgruntled men into doing basically anything.

That's not to say that some of the critiques of consumerism and 90s zeitgeist don't ring true, but it's important to realize where those words are coming from.

crdtb8_6,crdtb8,"Do philosophies and religions propose that people are driven to find something in which those people can place their belief? 

It seems to me that philosophies and religions propose that people *must* place their belief in those philosophies and religions, and the people who don't do so shall pay a penalty.

You did not say that dehumanization causes mental illness. (Nor did I say you said that.)

You implied that societal malaise causes organic disease. At the time, that did not seem to follow.

But now I realize such things do happen. For example, certain kinds of workplace stress—themselves caused by the lag between the pace of society's evolution and the pace of institutions' adaptation to that evolution—can cause cardiovascular disease. (And the author of this book may be tangentially making a similar point.)

You say that there are no absolutes, and I agree. And that is probably a big part of the reason why not every person has an inherent need to believe, and why not every person has an inherent discrete sexual identity.

When the main character in *Fight Club* discovers that there is no real basis for the things that seem to have been the dominant influences of his own behavior, during the course of the novel, Palahniuk's treatment of this revelation did not strike me as having been an effective portrayal of ""delusion"" (a vague expression, but I don't know what pathology would have caused the main character to have had such complex relationships and interactions with people who had never physically existed). You advance the idea that this is a story of mental illness, and others have reached the same conclusion.

That argument does not hold, when I examine the text. Instead, I see a violation of one of the axioms of Fiction Writing 101: Don't tell a story, and then reveal that its details were all merely creations of a character's dreaming mind.

Your opinion is worth at least as much as my own, and it is probably worth more. And I appreciate your civil manner of expression. To me, *Fight Club* is an artistic failure. Yet I am pleased to learn that you have found it edifying.",BullfrogOne,2019-08-20T12:52:49Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,6

mouxea_1,mouxea,"Strongly seconding most to all of what u/TrespassingWayfarer said and wanted to add - 

There is something of a tempting meta narrative as well, the way that Palahniuk relates to Fight Club the book and the Narrator relates to Fight Club the club. In the afterword, Palahniuk mentions going to a haunted house where the guide parodies Rules 1 and 2 (the first rule of *Fright Club* is...) and when Palahniuk says, 'you know, I wrote that book,' the guide responds 'it was a book?' Just as the diegetic club became a grotesque caricature full of tantalizing nihilism, so too are people beguiled by the destructive interpretation of the book where they idolize the character of Durden as an archetype. Just as the intentions of the club gets away from the Narrator, the Club gets away from Palahniuk. 

I think there is a strong argument to be made for Fight Club being a good case in Mens' Studies. There was a quote someone posted by Palahniuk a week or two ago about how there are not many novels about men addressing mental or emotional problems with other men. If Durden is the embodiment of toxic masculinity, what he warns most fervently against - do *NOT* talk about Fight Club - perhaps the opposite is precisely what you should do. Talk about the book. Do you relate to the Narrator? That is understandable; I would wager many do. But Durden is just a dark mirror to sleeping through life. Trade your boss for a pseudo spiritual leader, your life for corporate profits or your life for culture jamming pranks, ineffective emotional groups for ineffective physical ones, one broken system for another. Yeah, it is a harsh critic of an impoverished, consumerist society but also massive warning against toxic masculinity and because a good number of audiences fail to read (or view) it that way, it paradoxically serves to promote the latter. I would say the book is about toxic masculinity more than anything else.

How completely reasonable and identifiable-with feelings like this lead escalate to these extreme movements.

It's message really is about the need for these discontent/empty/alienated feelings to get steering and moderation, and be addressed by society, so they don't spiral into out-of-control destructiveness. A good current example of one that feels like it's unfolding right now is the incel movement/culture.",Mattjy1,2021-07-28T16:48:45Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,1

Your military is professional, all volunteers. And do those wars ever truly matter to a person back home? Give them any sort of struggle to participate in? Provide anything beyond a topic to fight over with their dad during family dinner on Christmas or other holiday?

You can *compare* anything with anything, of course, but there is also *no comparison* between life of a poor person in 30th and in the age of welfare state; between WW2 and Iraq. On individual scales - sure, there are and always will be people who go through tremendously hard times. On population scale - difference is at least a level of magnitude, possibly - multiple ones.

otddez_5,otddez,"There are a few things about current society that differ and will especially for those growing up now in the youngest generation and I think the effects are interesting. 

On the things like wars--yes we've been in an extremely protracted war, however I wouldn't call it anything similar to a ""great war"" where young men basically expected to be sent. It's very background for I think most people. Similar with the recession, while lots of people were greatly affected, it wasn't omni-present in-your-face, it was more a feeling of things are just a bit worse and more challenging. I think these, along with climate change awareness (which was present in the 90s too, but had a lot less traction) has created a baseline sense of just bad things happening in the world and to come.

For some (I think more than in Fight Club's day) this creates something of a mission to improve things--the things they are fighting are more definite than just ennui. But because they are still somewhat background, not everyone buys into that. That's created this out-group that doesn't feel in-step with the bigger cultural movement--some of them have a direct mission to oppose it, but a lot of others just find themselves in the out-group more as a matter of disengagement than of zeal. But they end up swept along and become part of Project Mayhem. So I think it's ended up being exacerbated by the fragmentation into in-group and out-group, and the upper-level direction of some outright trying to fight the direction of cultural movement.",Mattjy1,2021-07-28T18:19:17Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,5

I thought the film, Fight Club made a few significant improvements to the plot, while maintaining the integrity and grit of the book.

I told every one of my literate friends that Palahniuk was a genius, and started buying books just to give them.

By the time I finished Choke, I started to feel disappointed in the formula that was constantly returned to.  Everyman with a ""quirky profession"" makes observations about modern life, goes on some kind of inverted spiritual quest, finds meaninglessness at the end of said quest.  Insert plot twist.  Rinse, Lather Repeat.

I have a harder time revisiting those earlier works, because they meant something to me a decade ago, but they're just kind of hollow and indulgent now.  It's a lot like the film American Beauty.

4y27ar_3,4y27ar,"Definitely check out Fight Club, if only to mark a place in popular culture.  

I respond to his writing similarly to Brett Easton Ellisville: I don't always fall in love with the book, but I'm generally glad I read it. (I'd also add American Psycho to the list if you haven't read it)",Kerfluffle-Bunny,2016-08-17T15:55:05Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,3

sj918_1,sj918,"I haven't read it since I was in high school, so I'm not certain on all the details.  What I remember was after the narrator shoots himself, he wakes up in a psych ward. One of the janitors (or maybe just another patient who happens to be pushing a broom) recognizes him and lets him know that nothing has changed, it's still business as usual for the fight club/project mayhem guys.  Now that I say this, I feel like I'm confusing the book with the movie, so someone will have to correct me. 

Could you cite specifics that you want help on? Maybe that would help jog my memory some. ",ducttape83,2012-04-20T07:35:28Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,1
1qoguc_1,1qoguc,"Thematically I would advise Anthony Swafford ""Jarhead.""  Fight Club and Jarhead are about the same generation and the same kind of problems.  Vonnegut, however, is a better writer but of a different generation and faces completely different issues.  As far as mind-screwing you, Vonnegut fits the bill.

18p9ri_1,18p9ri,"It is and it isn't.

It's like reading a book published by Tyler Durden. It's pretty anti-materialism (something self-help books almost never are) and advocates doing your own thing rather than obeying the social norms.

I liked the book and thought that it reminded me a lot of *Fight Club*.",XDAYS,2013-02-18T00:35:49Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,1
15fqdh_1,15fqdh,"If you want more of a conventionally-written novel, go Fight Club - easy to read, very entertaining, great plot. 

Slaughterhouse Five and Catch 22, whilst a bit more difficult to read, are both absolutely fantastic books - two of my all-time favourites. Being post-modern, the narrative in both works is non-linear and can therefore be hard to follow at times. However, remember that this comprises the very nature of the books - their style; their *meaning*. Also the large number of characters in Catch 22 can be quite daunting - it certainly took me two full reads to get to grips with who was who. But stick with them and you will definitely reap the rewards.

Catch 22 is, on the whole, a bit more light-hearted than Slaughterhouse Five, and so might be a better book to ease into that general sub-genre with. Heller's satire is probably the best I've ever read, and well worth committing oneself to. Make sure to read Vonnegut as well - he brilliantly balances a hilarious black-comedy with a beautiful and profound existential questioning - indeed, there's something about Vonnegut that once you catch a glimpse of, will keep you hooked on his writing - I've since read all his novels multiple times...",,2012-12-26T00:19:06Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,1

zd9uk_1,zd9uk,"I think Tyler Durden was more of a minimalist than a communist. He despised consumerism.

> Fuck off with your sofa units and strine green stripe patterns, I say never be complete, I say stop being perfect, I say let... lets evolve, let the chips fall where they may. 

Marxism isn't necessarily an ideology that opposes consumerism. Marxism is about economic equality. I honestly don't think this is what Tyler was trying to go for. 

>The things you own end up owning you

I think Fight Club is a story about how we try to complete ourselves with possessions, but we don't need to do so. Tyler lives more comfortably in a broken down house than he ever did in his apartment full of IKEA. ",AMastermind,2012-09-05T02:37:25Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,1
zd9uk_2,zd9uk,"I agree. 

The Fight Club people were anarchists. Marx was, first and foremost, an anarchist; the socialism and communism thing was just to condition people to live peacefully in an anarchist society.",,2012-09-05T04:37:41Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,2
zd9uk_3,zd9uk,"Anarchist, hands down. Durden did not reveal himself as the leader of Fight Club. He walked around Fight Clubs during fights among the audience when shouting the rules. He was against consumerism and was so severely independent, he had no emotional attachment to Marla. However, the themes of love, masculinity, and religion play key roles in the book. The book is directly related to the book of Revelation (the last book about the end of the world in the Bible). Hands down. I could go on and on, I know more than I should know about Fight Club. Down to why the narrator's boss chooses the color ""cornflower blue"" for the icon. Socialism is distributing means of production through ""cooperative management"" while anarchism is not necessarily chaos, but a lack of hierarchy and a system of mutual aid. The idea of Project Mayhem is to take down the system, like Karl Marx said is necessary in order to create a new system, and start over at bottom and stay there. 

[Edit] Also, Tyler's main goal is economic and historical destruction. I recommend everybody look into the buildings that he says he is going to blow up. They're buildings that have archives, like credit card companies. He says he'll give everybody a ""clean slate"" because all documentation will be lost. Which again, implies Marx theory that ""a world revolution is essential to ultimately emancipate humankind from misery, poverty, want, and deprivation."" Which is EXACTLY what Project Mayhem aims to achieve. ",survivalrate,2012-09-07T23:07:42Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,3
zd9uk_4,zd9uk,"Fight Club is about being motivated by love to pursue masculinity, which is a concept that has been warped by consumerism and a lack of a father figure, implying that the major father figure (God) has failed us and that we have no obligation to make him like us, that our goal is to fight for nothing but ourselves by putting oneself in a position that life will never get worse.",survivalrate,2012-09-07T23:13:00Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Fight Club,4
