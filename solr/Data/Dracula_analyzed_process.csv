Dracula is written in letters and diary entries. They're dated. So someone took them all and has turned them into an email newsletter that will send you that day's Dracula text, and it's a *hoot* to read it this way with this many other people at the same pace.

I honestly thought that's what this thread would be about, since it just started in May and it's gone somewhat viral.

v2g0b6_10,v2g0b6,"My pet peeve about the book, or rather, all the other literature it inspired: sunlight mildly inconveniences Dracula. I may have some details wrong, it's been a while, but there are definitely scenes in the book where Dracula walks around and fights in daytime.  He can't shapeshift during daytime, and he needs to rest for various reasons and once he's resting, he can only become active at sunset. 

But that's it! Bursting into flame in sunlight or any other major problem with it was invented by Hollywood, and has somehow become the second biggest part of vampire lore there is, after needing blood. Even works that pretend to be ""getting back to the basics"" of vampires usually include some problem with sun. It's weird, and makes some vampires so weak it's almost hard to take them seriously.",cybishop3,2022-06-01T14:42:50Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,10

Stoker's book would be obscure if it weren't for the movies.  I go to Whitby a lot, where the Dracula tourism industry is huge.  But I got hold of a guidebook from 1926 - no mention of anything related AT ALL.  The whole phenomenon came from Hollywood.

My wife once took over as a cook at a residential school where the previous cook was an Eastern European who'd had to lesve abruptly.  She'd gone bananas and had blown a huge proportion of the catering budget buying ropes of garlic to festoon all the doorways as protection from vampires.

v2g0b6_23,v2g0b6,"I hated it with a passion. It might well have invented the 'found footage' genre of horror where a home video, or a journal, is purported to be found, and make the viewer think they are seeing real events. It's a framing device I can't stand, and in the case of Dracula it results in essentially reading somebody's diary, and it was just so plodding and hard to read in that manner. 

Regarding Vampire lore, the reason so much is included is that it invented much of the lore. There weren't really vampires before Dracula, but vampires are based on much older lore. 

The Romanians called them Strigoi vue and Strigoi mort but you can call them strigoi for short. This is where the vampire legends come from, they didn't call them vampires, they were strigoi. Vlad Tepes also has nothing to do with vampires or Dracula, that is purely a modern story telling twist. If you ever played the Witcher games, you might have heard of the Polish Striga, this is their own version of a strigoi. 

Strigoi vue are basically vampires. They live a very long time and feed off of the life of those around them but not necessarily by blood, it's more of a psychic feeding. They are not undead, can go out in the sun, eat, have families, but they are not human. They have unnatural strength, they don't really age or get old, and they have certain mental powers over people. There are some caveats too, they can't leave their homes or travel. They are kind of stuck living where they were born. This might be where Draculas need to carry his home soil around with him comes from. But Strigoi have reflections, can eat garlic, and they didn't really kill the people they fed off of, they just drained them. 

Then there are the strigoi mort, and this is where it gets interesting. They are dead people that aren't done living. They rise from the grave, and seek earthly pleasures. Eating, smoking, drinking, having sex, they are lusty, hungry, wanton creatures that look like people, but only want to indulge in earthly pleasures. This more than anything is where I think Zombie tropes come from. Especially the hunger part. They aren't rotting or look like corpses, but they did die, usually in a violent fashion, and if they aren't given a proper burial they come back, they often show up on somebody's doorway and will refuse to leave until they are fed and given liquor. Basically you have to frantically feed them or they will do very bad things to you like curse you. Your best bet is to give them the time of their lives so they move on.",kodack10,2022-06-01T17:32:17Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,23

It was sitting on the clerk's table, probably waiting to be ""processed"" (ie be logged into inventory and have that sleeve put in to hold the library card on the back.) I was waiting for it to finally hit the shelf. The problem was, it didn't. It sat on the clerk's table for close to year. At that point, I was a senior, I think it was that time when we basically didn't go to classes anymore so we basically just hung out at the lib in between graduation practice. The clerks were out for lunch, I see the book on the back of their table. I swiped it, put it in my bag, and went home and read it. I still have it to this day and it's one of my favorite possessions.

Another terribly funny part, of course, is that Dracula was also a sorcerer, having graduated with honors from the Scholomance, a school of evil magic run by the devil.

v2g0b6_81,v2g0b6,"I've noticed a lot of the public-domain monsters (Dorian Grey, Frankenstein, etc.) have far less magic and fantastical elements than you would expect given their pop culture status. 

Dracula was written shortly after Oscar Wilde was put on trial, found guilty for the crime of homosexuality, and given a sentence so grueling he died just two years later - alone, penniless, without a friend. 

His novel, Dorian Gray, was used as evidence during his trial. And the whole incident sparked a massive backlash which reinforced the conservative hegemony. 

(Which made Wilde unpopular with his format friends, who disliked all the new, negative press and scrutiny his book caused them. He died sick, penniless, and without a friend just two years after writing his book.) 

Oscar Wilde and Bram Stoker weren't close friends, but they were contemporaries. They ran in the same circles. The Wilde trial was a media firestorm, it absolutely would have been on Stoker's mind. 

a common queer reading of the next is that Stoker was writing to vent his fears about dangerous homoeroticism in the wake of the Wilde trial.

v2g0b6_82,v2g0b6,"Well, there's not much more to my point. For me at least, when I read a classic book I expect to find it has a lot less modern tropes since it has been done to death and adapted over and over, each time adding more things that are now tropes of the original work but that aren't found in it. Another example is the ""classic"" Sherlock Holmes' ""elementary, my dear Watson"" quote, I don't think it's found in any of the books. That doesn't really happens with Dracula, I can't think of any vampire trope that is not in Dracula except maybe for their hate of werewolves.

Vampires in Dracula hate garlic, they can't cross running water easily, they turn into mist or animals (particularly bats and wolves), they are repealed by holy symbols like crosses, sanctified things like sacramental bread, they don't have a reflection, they are hot, they have to go back to their coffin or buried ground each day, they can charm people with their sight, they can only be killed by an oak stake to their heart or the Sun, they become more powerful the older they get and the older ones can overcome some of their vulnerabilities... To me it's amazing that I can only think of one trope that has been added to popular culture's vampire lore since the book was released, and I find it pretty unique among classic books.",Matt_Dragoon,2022-06-01T17:31:01Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,82

In one of the few scenes that is blatantly (hetero)sexual, Dracula interrupts the proceedings and jealously declares the man to be his.

Stoker himself was a closeted gay man. He knew Oscar Wilde (some believe they may have been lovers), and Dracula was written right around the time Wilde was imprisoned for homosexuality.

10nxet1_45,10nxet1,"I'd imagine the distance is definitely a factor. Since this thread is about cowboys and Dracula, it's got me thinking about the Romani, who get some of this same pop culture treatment.  

Like for many current day Americans, they're romanticized as  free-spirited artists and wanderers, while 19th century English-speaking writers like Bram Stoker or HP Lovecraft (born in 1890) depict them as these unclean servants of evil without any redeeming qualities. And then modern Europeans living in cities with large Romani populations have yet again a different set of stereotypes. 

It's disturbing to think about how Hitler famously loved  Winnetou, and related to the struggles of Native Americans against the colonists, but then well, went all Hitler-y on his own groups he deemed subhuman. It's like whether an ethnic group is seen as ""free-spirited and noble"" or.... an obstacle to ""progress""... is less dependent on who they actually are as real humans, and more to do with the distances involved and often the psychological projections of the in-group's aspirations or fears.

The beginning was so eerie: you had Jonathan Harker going to a strange foreign country, meeting people who were palpably afraid and disturbed, then finally getting to Dracula's castle after an eldritch experience in the nearby forests. The castle itself is equally horrifying, and we get to experience all of the scares in Harker's intimate epistolary prose. I even enjoyed the section with Lucy Westenra, Jack Seward, and Abraham Van Helsing. I loved Van Helsing as a character and enjoyed Westenra's death and resurrection. The Renfield bits were interesting too and, in retrospect, I wish Stoker had expanded on him a bit more. I was surprised how well the book held up, especially since I think that horror tends to date really badly. The characters were also so great, each one felt like a real person and I was quickly worried about their fates. All of this and then... it just kind of putters out. Oddly enough, even though the stakes (pun intended) were raised more and more as the book came to its conclusion, I became less and less invested. It just couldn't capture the dread I felt at Dracula's castle or the helplessness of watching Westenra turn into the vampire. Overall, I enjoyed it but felt that its quality fluctuated. Also, I read Salem's Lot afterward and was able to pick up on some of the references King makes to Dracula that I might have missed had I not just read the novel.

853z3d_23,853z3d,"I loved it.  It took a minute for things to really build up but that's one of the great things about classical writing is it doesn't rush into the climax.  The backstory and dialogue gives the characters time to assess the situation in a more realistic way.  Bram Stokers 'Dracula ' scared the absolute heck out of me. The way the tension builds and just plateaus without immediate resolution is what gives the story its strength

I feel like a lot of modern story writing is driven by its potential to make a movie so the characters are less likely to make mistakes and assumptions while they're following the story line.  Dracula and other older novels don't do that.  They aren't in a rush,  the characters aren't flawless or even particularly bright,  they just are and they're existing in their circumstances with realistic fears and determination. 

I really enjoyed the book when i read it simply because you can fall in line with the characters thinking and behavior.  It was scary,  it was unexpected,  and there weren't moments where the characters judgement of a situation wasn't justified whether it was a correct assessment or not.

EDIT: Although one thing that I just remembered (I think I recall correctly?) that I thought was very cool that hasn't really appeared in vampire mythos since is the suggestion that Dracula arose as a mindless monster and only very slowly over a great deal of time did he develop mentally and learn to emulate the noble he appears to be.

853z3d_38,853z3d,"Dracula is definitely in my top 5 favourite books.

First of all, I like the format, an epistolary novel is well-suited to this story. You only see and feel what the characters see and feel and it helps us get in the mood of the novel. Discovering Transylvania through Jonathan's eyes really makes me feel I've stepped in a far and strange land, nearly as if I had gone back in time with his (sometimes condescending) descriptions.

Then I like that it's the Ur-example of the vampire story but there are still some surprising elements. As you said, when you first start reading it, you think it's going to be like every other vampire story but then you find elements that most other stories have ignored like the fact that sunlight don't harm him, just prevent him from transforming and the whole native soil thing.

I also like the fact that the old gothic castle that we see in every gothic novel is not the whole setting of the novel. It appears at the beginning and at the end but the rest of the story is set in Modern England (well, modern when the book was written). You go to Whitby and London, you're not stuck in Transylvania.

And speaking of modern, I like the modernity of the novel: science and modern transportation are heavily used and Mina's definitely a modern woman. Alright, scientific discoveries have made some of the science used in the book outdated (blood transfert without knowing the blood type for instance) but you can still feel Stoker used the latest scientific disccoveries for his novel.

853z3d_40,853z3d,"As a horror book, it's not very scary. Drac himself has been done to death and so a lot of what he is/does comes across a trite or corny. That's not the book's problem: that's just the result of a century or so of media doing Drac from every angle. 

There's also an aspect of personal taste too: I grew up reading when Anne Rice was the queen of vampires, so I find the ""pure monster"" style vampire to be a bit lame. I like the ""vampire as a tragic reflection of humanity"" style of vampire. But that's just personal taste. Dracula is one of the few books where I think the film (specifically the Coppola adaptation) is better than the book from a pure entertainment standpoint.

From a literary perspective, though, the book is a fascinating window into Victorian culture and mores and has a lot to say on the questions of democracy vs aristocracy, science vs superstition, a women's role in the world and to society, the rise of technology, etc. ",marisachan,2018-03-17T19:58:33Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,40

I was also surprised how I didn't know how it would go. I always loved modern vampire fiction (pre-Twilight), so I thought I'd know all the vampiric powers/ect. since Dracula was a big basis for a lot of the modern stuff. But I didn't! I guess Dracula is so old that modern vampire writers have deviated from him enough that the ""stereotypical"" vampire I picture isn't entirely accurate to the book dracula. A very pleasant surprise.

Similarly, I liked Frankenstein for the same reasons. It was a little more dense (though I did listen to it as an audio book, so perhaps that affected my enjoyment), but still really good. We all know modern references to the monster, but the source material is different enough it feels fresh.",LadySilvie,2018-03-17T20:05:50Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,42
853z3d_43,853z3d,"It’s one of those things I picked up because I like gothic romanticism and think vampires are cool and all that, but fully expected to be a bit of a brick. 

Nope! I was surprised by how much of a “human story” it turned out to be. Sure, the atmosphere was chilling and the count himself is rad, but there was something so positive and touching in the depiction of the relationships between the band of heroes that I came away from the book feeling warmed. Not just in the way that Mina cares for Lucy and the men for both of them, but in the way the men are concerned for each other as well, though they were initially brought together because they were interested in the same woman. 

The parts of the book that stuck with me the most were the passages where one of the characters would offer his own blood for transfusion because another one was already weak, and the way they’d stand guard outside Mina’s room. It’s weird to describe Dracula as heartwarming but I genuinely feel that about it.

I remember being really thrown by the epistolary style of the novel.  It was the first I encountered, and I am glad to have been given that chance. Dracula, the story, the novel, and the character, are nothing like we imagine - much like Frankenstein.

I read big chunks of the first two on my breaks at my first job. (A funny thing is I have the smell of barbeque kettle chips associated with those books because I would eat those during my breaks too.) 

Dracula surprised me, like it seemed to surprise a lot of people. I liked the letters format because my previous exposure to a story written in that style was a dumb, conservative Christian series called Mail Order Brides. I don't recommend them. 

Dracula himself surprised me. Imagining him in the way Stoker describes him was difficult, because I was so used to the Hollywood widow's peak and clean shaven face. A Drac with facial hair??? It jarred me a bit, and I had to read over his description a few times. I had also not watched Billy and Mandy before reading this, which does depict Drac in the way Stoker describes, and I really appreciate that now.

Previous comments have mentioned the comedy of errors type events that lead yo the death of the women and, hoo boy, are they ever right. It's definitely one of the biggest flaws in the book. The dead ship confused me at first, had to reread that part a few times too. Van Helsing just annoyed me tbh.

There was also a lot of sexual tension regarding the fact that women became seduced and spellbound by Dracula. At a time when there was no sexual literature, the readers of Dracula were probably getting a taste of sexuality they hadn't ever witnessed or read about. 

The only thing about the book that I didn't like is how it went on and on about certain things. Wasn't 25% of the book about Lucy being sick?

It never really dawned on me the first time I read it, but there's some pretty strong anti-Semitism going on in the book. It's not too hard to paint Dracula as a metaphor for an invasive, parasitic enemy from the east with mystical and dark connotations. He's physical description is a Jewish stereotype, with a crooked nose and everything. It's even explicitly stated that he gets around Europe by enlisting help from a Jew, as well as a band of traveling gypsies. 

That said, I still love the novel. It's an exceptional work of fiction, despite Bram Stoker's personal opinions. ",,2018-03-17T20:59:40Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,95

Going to have to disagree here.

I certainly don't think the female characters are anything exceptionable, even given the time period.

*Dracula* was published in 1897—not 1397. Plenty of Stoker's predecessors and contemporaries were writing well-rounded, intelligent, and active female characters, to say nothing of the many successful, respected female authors publishing their own novels in and before his time.

Anyway, the book expands on Harker's time in the castle and that makes up about 2/3 of Powers of Darkness. Having read both I preferred Powers of Darkness for the time that Harker was at the castle, but the second half of Dracula is way better in my opinion. Powers of Darkness wraps up the story way too quickly. It's almost like Ásmundsson was like ""oh shit I went over on the first part, gotta make this quick"".

The worst part to me is what they did to Mina. In the book Mina is critical to their success in a very unique way (her organizational skills) and is extremely dedicated to the cause. She does everything right, which makes it scarier that this evil is able to corrupt her to the point where God has essentially forsaken her. That's scary! Then at the end her sense of empathy and the situation she's in due to being bitten makes it clear that Dracula and his wives are trapped in their own Hellish existence which heightens the fear. Dracula was cursed to live this evil existence, and the same could happen to anyone.

In the movie she's a non-entity, she exists solely to be longed for by Dracula. She doesn't help the group at all because she actively does not want to be helped. Her role is to go ""No! No! Oh yes!"" when Dracula is around. They even made it that Jonathan figured out the routes to intercept Dracula. That was Mina's thing!

The only adaption I could really say was similar in tone and story (somewhat) was the British TV movie Count Dracula (1977), though it’s not a definitive version by any means.

The ending left me truly frustrated. Vanhelsing and Mina facing off against the 3 vampire women was good as was Vanhelsing going into the castle. All the while Mina gets closer and closer to turning. But ultimately this tension built up to nothing. 

The ending with the death of Dracula was frustrating, Quincy and Jonathan charge into a group of hired gypsies and Quincy gets stabbed. A lot of good those winchesters were when you don't use them and get yourself stabbed meanwhile Quincy previously shot at a bat and was also supposed to be all about the battle plans.

I picked it and Frankenstein up at the same time - and the difference in the writing style couldn't be more marked. It was only much later that I grew to appreciate the beauty of Shelley's writing - but Dracula? 

Wow! 

It felt so modern, and the short entries made it a true page turner that just kept turning the screw and bringing a real sense of dread to the story. The fate of Lucy was genuinely shocking and then there are the diary entries from the Demeter. 

More than forty years later I can still remember the sheer terror I got from reading that section - I knew what was happening, but the poor souls on the ship had no clue.

> There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'See! see! I prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know—nay, had I even guess at him—one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and the bat—the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him—without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again? We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man.",iceman012,2023-10-20T15:22:26Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,8

I love that. The fact that the book is written as a sequence of letters becomes part of the plot when the characters exchange the letters, then the genre switches from ""horror movie"" to ""revenge film."" Someone's gotta get Liam Neeson to play Van Helsing, I say.

There are lots of great bits sprinkled throughout because the characters are very fun and likable, but those two moments are still extremely effective bits of horror.

If you're curious about some of the inspirations for Dracula, I highly recommend reading Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu. Stoker borrowed so much from the novella. It also has a great web series adaptation (and a sequel movie)",steampunkunicorn01,2023-10-21T23:36:29Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,18

If you're looking for more vampire books, Fledgling by Octavia Butler is fantastic. Just be aware she had plans of writing a series but tragically died before she could write more.

17c0z5a_50,17c0z5a,"The alternative would have been that Dracula would somehow learn that the hunting party was approaching, and understanding that he wouldn't have any place to hide for the day, decides to attack before sunrise, hoping he can still get back to the box in time.

Then we would have had the hunting party stalling for time as Dracula tries to kill as many as he can in few minutes (perhaps there would have been few redshirts along from a local village, so we can have more deaths). Just as the core group is about the get it, Dracula runs away to get to safety in time (iirc, it wasn't just the sunlight, it was the turning into a corpse even in total darkness). As he's now in Transylvania, he doesn't even need the box full of homesoil, but can go ANYWHERE. The hunters don't realise this at first, losing time by advancing to the castle and finding the box -- empty.

Then they'd have to backtrack to where they saw Dracula, and try to guess from the cues where he might have hidden.

That way we can raise the stakes, if you pardon the pun. 

Finally they find the corpse in some nearby cave, which also has some old skeletons and trashed ottoman armour -- this is a place where Dracula dumped his enemies while he was alive. At the back of the cave, surrounded by the skeletons of his old victims, they find Dracula himself. He's not at peace, but looks fearful, even as he's but a corpse.

The last rays of sunlight are falling at the front of the cave, as they stake Dracula, who gets animated for one last final breath before turning into dust, trying to remove the stake from his chest. Perhaps the sun just fell -- which is a bit of a copout -- or perhaps the curse that animated him had one last trick in its sleeve?

I think Dracula and Frankenstein are great companion reads, especially if you imagine their contemporary worlds. Very different, but some similar topics.

Frankenstein, to me, is about the danger of new tech in an unreformed world. The ego and loneliness of Dr. Frankenstein taint his works.

Dracula is an old evil, made more dangerous by growing globalism and labyrinths of bureaucracy.

Each fault ivory tower science for ignoring ancient works and folk wisdom.

I've read a few epistolary works, but this was unique in how many characters it featured. I felt it creates some narrative distance, and I was ready for any or all of the characters to die, since someone else could finish the tale.

I re-read the book in high school for a book report, which was fun but not too analytical. Then this year I took a German class about vampire literature and film (1700s to the remake of Nosferatu) at my university, and found even greater richness in reading it once more. There are some excellent motifs of duality and existential confusion; Dracula is a well-layered book.

If you're interested in more ""classic"" vampires, I would suggest Carmilla by Le Fanu (It's an older vampire story where the vampire is a female, but it is the first story to introduce lesbian vampires--so a female, rather than a male, human is on the other side of the vampire-human relationship.

jis1cx_40,jis1cx,"Which musical?

Probably about 10 years ago now, I bought the movie musical 'Phantom of the Opera' from amazon. So then later Amazon recommended a 'Dracula' musical to me. I was shocked, I didn't even know there was a 'Dracula' musical. So of course I ordered it (DVD).

This musical was produced in Canada and was in French. (I don't speak French.) It wasn't quite what I expected but, after watching it several times, I decided I really liked it so I went to Amazon to order a CD of the music.

I looked up 'Dracula musical CD' and, much to my surprise, Amazon showed me a CD of a different musical, a German one. Not one, but two 'Dracula' musicals! So I ordered the German CD (I speak some German.)

This CD ended up changing my life. I immediately fell in love with the lead singers voice, which led me into investigating other musicals, which ultimately led me to 'Tanz der Vampyre' (Dance of the Vampire), my favorite musical of all time. I've made friends in The Netherlands, Germany, and Austria and I meet up with them every couple of years and we go see musicals. I've been to Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna, Magdeburg, and Stuttgart and have met up with extended family that I hadn't seen in 40 years. I plan on going back as soon as possible.

This is obviously way more than you need to know but the words 'Dracula musical' have a fond place in my heart.

I understand that there are at least two other Dracula musicals. I have one around here somewhere (didn't like it much) and the second that Frank Langela starred in.

The strange women in the castle with Jonathan, for instance. I've always assumed that they were other vampires, but they don't seem as deteriorated as Dracula.

The story with shipping containers of grave earth over is excellent, and it really shows what kind of evil forethought goes into this ""invasion of Britain"" plan of Dracula's.

Renfield's obsession with consuming life is very interesting. Not a vampire himself, it's almost like he's trying to emulate one the best way he can.

And Mina's being attacked by a monstrous beast repeatedly, and being fed Dracula's blood. It's clear that he is no ordinary vampire, and it's interesting to see how far his powers go. 

I agree with you that the last third of the book is less satisfying as you're pretty sure at that point that they will be victorious. The only real tension left is whether or not Mina will survive as well.",rhadamanth_nemes,2016-06-11T12:11:13Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,2

The most effective men in the story are Abraham van Helsing (Dutch), Quincy Morris (American, specifically Texan) and Dracula himself (Slavic).

Jonathan Harker is such a complete wet noodle that he's writing about paprika chicken recipes while Transylvanian peasant women are sobbing and begging him not to go to the castle.  Then you get into threads of infidelity while pretending to be virtuous, etc.  Dr. Seward runs a 19th century insane asylum - the very definition of a quack.  And Arthur Holmward... exists?

4nl229_7,4nl229,"Just finished reading it the other day.  The Christian horror is very different than the suspense and murderfests of our day.  The fear of Dracula was beyond becoming a vampire or death.  It was eternal separation from God that they were afraid of.  You read it in Van Helsing's speeches about Lucy.  You see a greater fear for her soul than her body.  Later, Dracula moves to Mina.  He is able to seduce her and feast upon her while her husband sleeps next to her.  He bypasses her free will and threatens eternal damnation.  It is the mark given to her by the wafer that marks her realization of what is happening against her will.  The mark is akin to the Biblical sign for being unclean and being unable to partake of the sacrament.  

What I really appreciate about the book is the New Woman and the avoidance of the cliche.  Mina is an active player in the book.  It is not the traditional female helpless woman that perhaps never existed in anywhere but prejudiced dreams, but rather one based on Biblical women such as Deborah.

The mixture of Reason, Christianity, Paganism, the Old World and the unexplainable make for such an interesting mix.  Nowadays the debate between reason and mystery has Agnostics (or Atheists) pitted against Christians.  In the past, Christians were the scientists.  What is consistent both then and now is the need for man to provide reason for the great mysteries in life along with life's way of showing that there are an endless supply of things that mettle with reason.",Elyikiam,2016-06-11T14:19:11Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,7
4nl229_8,4nl229,"I liked the first ""Act"" of the book a lot. The way the letter format keeps us kind of ""in the dark""; the pace of Johnathan's discoveries and growing dread;  the indirect and organic way we hear the peasants' folk wisdom; the imagery and atmosphere of the castle, surrounded by mountains and the brooding forest...

I enjoyed the second part as well (especially the sequence involving the shipwreck), up until just before Lucy's death. Around that time several things took me out of it, such as: 

  -The incredibly poor communication between the heroes, particularly by Van Helsing, even after they had a bunch of dialogue about the importance of sharing information. More generally, their gross negligence in protecting Lucy.
        
 -The book's parody-of-itself portrayal of gender relations. Maybe it's just a reflection of the era, but it was laughable how much time they spent talking about the weakness of the women and their need for rest and protection. Perhaps Stoker was trying to draw attention to the problem, as it caused at least one ""oh no!"" moment in the plot, but it just felt dumb.
        
   -The vibe of the whole thing once they ""kill"" vampire Lucy and begin hunting Dracula. The pacing and style devolved to the point of pulp, I felt no suspense, and the characters' combination of melodramatic solemnity and ridiculous ineptitude made the whole thing almost laughable.

Edit: TL;DR -- I was disappointed. I don't think it should be considered a classic. Stoker had some good ideas: the letter/diary format, the similar claustrophobias of the characters (in space, in suspicion) and the reader (in information, in dramatic irony); but ultimately he failed to execute them in a way that deserves the title of ""classic"".

I have no idea what ""books were like"" at the time so I don't know if this would have flown at all, but I would have liked it to be somewhat darker. Dracula talks big about being able to predict their every move and blah blah blah, and at first it seems like he can back that claim up, but in the end his escape seems kind of desperate, the act of somebody with truly no aces up his sleeve, and that disappointed me. The whole time they were tracking his boat, and later his carriage, I kept thinking ""Okay, NOW he's gonna spring the trap on them!"" but it never materialized.

I also thought it was kind of lame that nobody among the vampire hunters really had any flaws. They acted like perfect knights from an Arthurian myth (except even those guys had the occasional flaw). It read less like a real account of what happened and more like someone's idealized revision of events, which given the nature of the writing I suppose is possible.

But man, if I had taken a drink every time someone was overcome with the chivalry or selfless acts of someone else in the group and moved to tears, I'd have been dead before they even finished tracking down dirt containers.

This reminded me of Lucy when she is a vampire about she is more suggestive/sexual, basically letting all her inhibitions/society expectations go and is being her ""true"" self. 

I'm also still trying to make sense of the weird 3-wayish scene where the men walk in on Dracula in bed with a passed out Harker and with Mina drinking blood from his chest.  I read Dracula as part of a college english course focusing on monster lore.

Great attention is payed to the use of shorthand and typewriters as well as trains and other transportation which were very modern at the time. This technology seems quaint to us now, but when Dracula was written, the would have served to reinforce the disparity between the heroic, modern Anglo protagonists and the superstitious, and antiquated Eastern European villain. Horror stories are great at telling us what the story's contemporaries feared. In the case of Dracula, the conflict is very much modernity and science vs. antiquity and superstition. This central conflict points towards a fear that embracing technology will cause us to forget important traditions and weaken the moral resolve of our culture. The moral decay component is especially strong in Dracula considering the beastial and sexual nature of the villian's attacks on Lucy and Mina.",knuckles523,2016-06-11T18:45:56Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,17

Also, if you're into campy movie adaptations, watch the Bram Stoker's Dracula version. It's a totally intentional B-movie adaptation but it's so well cast!

Id have to agree with you on the epistolary narration being something I really enjoyed when reading, as it gave us a sense of helplessness as though reading the journals/letters/etc but being helpless and unable to help. It added an element of realism in my mind at the very least.

Might as well mention my thoughts on the sexual side of things just since I wrote the paper on it and all; well essentially Stoker broke a silence, showing the grim and sexually corrupt side of Victorian England, when virtually no authors in Europe during the 1800's would even mention it. Of course we can also see Stokers opinions of how women were regarded; specifically by religion. Mina and Lucy may have been the only real female characters in the book, but they were by far the focus along side the perverse Count Dracula himself. Without going in to too much detail, the women were seen as sexually vulnerable and easily 'corrupted' by their temptation for lust. Lucy was spoken down of to an extreme in the writing, whereas Mina kept true to her beliefs and represented the angel archetype against Lucy's devilish counterpart. 

Doing all the research and writing for this side of the story made it even more of a fearsome book to behold.

I understand the need to read it within the context of the time, so the casual sexism, calling children 'it' etc doesn't bother me. (Animal Farm, for example, feels simple and unsubtle today but is interesting reading within the context of when it was written.) I thought the characters all lacked depth and motive or development.

What really bothered me was the core message of the book. At no point in the early part of the book does Dracula do anything wrong, he's hated for just 'being a monster'. The whole book felt to me like an archaic christian parable, with its moral absolutes and the story with Lucy a metaphor for sex outside of marriage.

I even went so far at the time as reading the attempts to give her a blood transfusion to 'fix' the 'fall from purity' as paralleled by the abhorrent belief that raping lesbians would make them straight. (That was in the news a lot at the time, so maybe that influenced me).

Anyway, I thought the whole book was really one-dimensional and lacked any redeeming qualities.

The ambiguity of Dracula's death solidifies his mystique. Dracula is 'killed' but turns into smoke, which stoker's vampires can do anyway. So is he truly dead?

WEEK 12: Dracula, by Bram Stoker.

Jonathan Harker is a solicitor tasked with going to Transylvania to assist one Count Dracula in buying a house in England. Once he arrives at Castle Dracula, he finds pretty promptly that not only is Dracula a weird dude, but he cannot leave, and is trapped in the castle. Once he sees some supernatural goings on, he surmises that he ain’t gonna be let out of this place alive, so he manages to escape, but goes mad in the process.

Back across the pond in jolly old England, Dr. Seward, a sanitarium manager, starts noticing some strange goings on with his new neighbor. Jonathan’s missus, Mina, her friend, Lucy, and her fiancé Arthur all get involved, and Seward has to call in his old teacher, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing to save the day. What follows is a story of intrigue, love, loss, and bravery.

This is a cool book. It is written in an epistolary format, which is a word I had to look up to make sure I got it right; basically, it’s written as a series of diary entries and letters, with some newspaper stories thrown in. Therefore, it reads like a detective story with some great dramatic irony - you have more information than the characters, and hence feel a lot more tension. There’s a great bit about ¾ of the way through where all of the perspective characters have met up, and decide to pool their knowledge - recorded in their various journals and letters - so they can all read each other’s stories, and hence have the better chance of hunting the vampire. I like to think Bram Stoker did this so he wouldn’t have to keep track of who knew what so far into the book.

It’s a little weird reading the foundation of such an iconic monster and character. All the vampire tropes are there - can’t be out in daylight, hates garlic and Christian iconography, can turn into a bat, sucks blood and places people under thrall so they have to do his bidding -  but it’s interesting to see how they are dealt with in their original context. One that doesn’t really come up that much is that Dracula his command over wolves, and can turn into one. There’s also a weird telepathic link thing where one of his victims is forced to drink from his blood, and hence becomes more linked to him as a thrall under his command. It’s definitely cool though - Stoker does a good job of having a set list of rules that the monster must follow (which Van Helsing basically spells out early in the book) and then sets up some detective work and crimes based on these rules, and gets the characters to figure it out.

The main theme that I could see in this book is madness; when one is faced with the horror of an undead foe, can one help but go mad in the process? Especially when it is impossible to ask for help from the authorities, as no-one will believe your story? How then, can one judge the conventionally mad, when they may be no different to an objective viewer? This is supported quite well in the prose - after the introduction of the book, Jonathan Harker is not heard of for several chapters, as he went mental after escaping. It takes him a few months to return to his former self, and only when Van Helsing confirms what happened to him - his own self doubt mirroring the fears they all have that nobody will believe their tale. Dr. Seward’s patient Renfield is another interesting case; already a patient at a mental institution, when Dracula starts messing with him and placing him under thrall, nobody will trust him and believe him as he is conventionally mad. The burden of an unbelievable truth is an old trope (back to Cassandra in Greek myth), but it works really well, and keeps a 450 page book interesting.

I would recommend this book. It’s gripping, a well told thriller with good characters and a great villain. There’s a lot of good prose in there, and his use of different voices for different characters is entertaining (the Dutch Van Helsing’s slightly broken English being the most used example). While a little long winded at times after a very strong opening 65ish pages (some page-long paragraphs are a pain in the arse to read), it mostly stays focused, and pays off in the end.

4nl229_43,4nl229,"Dracula is one of my all-time favorite books and I've probably read it about ten times. That said, I agree completely that the ending is lacking. There are some nice scenes towards the end (the confrontation in the house Dracula has rented, particularly) but the actual climax itself is drawn out for too long and then the final showdown ends far too swiftly. More than once I have actually stopped reading the book before the end because all the best parts are long past and after all, I've read it before. I imagine Stoker probably just didn't know how to end it, so he did his best.

The storyline is great, but I found the writing really awkward and stilted, particularly the dialogue, and the characters to be very dull and one dimensional. Their constant piousness along with other religious aspects of the book just irritated me. I think of this book in the same way as Jaws - it became part of the zeitgeist, and kickstarted a whole genre of other works, but is actually a terrible read. Maybe I was a bit spoiled as I read Frankenstein first, and that is just a mind blowingly excellent read, and I was expecting Dracula to be similar. I actually read Dracula as I was travelling by train across Eastern Europe a few years ago, (including a stop in Transylvania) and I should have chucked it out the window on one of the many times I wanted to.

Jonathan was slightly milquetoast to me, by with the era in mind, rollicking action heroes weren't as much of a thing in those times. Mina was a nice change of pace, and I fell completely head over heels for Lucy Westenra.

I thought the last act was pretty great. Finally, the action!!! The buildup made the payoff much better than anything I had read up to this point. Or maybe that was Quincy.

It's been a long time, over 20 years in fact, but I'll always remember it fondly. Fighting sleep for days because of what might be climbing the house, having to keep the windows closed in Georgia in summer, and little 9 year old me feeling like Lucy would have been my main squeeze.

I loved Van Helsing, at first I didn't due to his rough grasp of the English language making it difficult to understand him, but later I saw the pattern in his speech and it was almost poetic. His character as this mysterious genius who loves every other character like family, despite just meeting them, was so endearing. Not to mention that he drives the hunt for Dracula and refuses to rest till the villainous devil has been destroyed just cemented him as my favorite character in the book. Immediately after finishing Dracula I bought Kim Newman's book ""Anno Dracula"" because I wanted to read more set in this universe. I recommend ""Anno Dracula"" if you want the same.

Coincidences everywhere.

1. Dracula's ship just happens to come to port where Mina is having a vacation, Mina being the fiance of the man who helped arrange Dracula's trip.

2. Mina's friend becomes Dracula's victim in a town full of potentials. (This might be excused a little since it's clear that Mina and Lucy spent a lot of time at Dracula's hiding place while they were talking at the funeral, so maybe Dravula followed them? But Dracula should have been sleeping in any case.)

3. Dracula just happens to buy, long in advance, the abbey next to the asylum that is run by Lucy's suitor. It makes sense in one way since Dracula and Renfield seemed to have had a bond from long before, so Dracula wanted to be  near his servant. But it's a heck of a coincidence that the doctor is not only in love with Lucy, but even knows her at all.

4nl229_65,4nl229,"""Dracula"" is a great example of how social and political trends at work during the late 19th century, specifically feminism, were expressed through literature and fiction. 

The feminist movement (women's liberation) was in full-swing in England by the late 19th century. As with all social movements, there were detractors who railed against change, and Bram Stoker sat firmly in the old-school conservative camp where women stayed in the home, stayed quite, and took care of their husbands and children. This novel was an expression of Stoker's conservative anti-feminist views, and a dire warning to the ""dangers"" of female liberation. 

Case in point; the two female leads are Mina and Lucy. Mina is traditional, conservative, and pure. She is pursued by the corrupt and carnal Count Dracula but ultimately prevails due to her virtuous conservative nature. Lucy however is a ""modern woman"" who is sexually liberated, shuns tradition by making choices for herself, and her liberated ""lustful"" nature leads to her conversion into a vampire. As a vampire Lucy becomes the antithesis of a proper woman. According to traditional values, a woman's purpose is to be a wife and a mother.  Lucy's brazen sexuality allows her to be corrupted by Dracula and turned into a vampire. As a vampire Lucy becomes the anti-mother who feeds on the bodies of children instead of feeding children with her body. 

Stoker was equating women's liberation with an absolute inversion of what it is to be a woman. That a liberated woman is dangerous, destructive, and incapable of supporting a traditional family unit. It's a direct corollary that Stoker's fear of feminism lead to one the great classic horror novels.",atavus68,2016-06-12T05:30:23Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,65

lucy is at her most vulnerable while engaged, but not yet married. that's what attracts a predator like dracula to her in the first place. she's a challenge and a trophy. she is ultimately discredited, but not before mina is swayed by dracula... but forearmed with knowledge of dracula's perfidy, the men and mina can more successfully rebuff and deny dracula.

i dunno. it's a very surface interpretation, but also structure was a very different thing, a less studied topic, and beyond that, dracula has the framing of being a travel story, a structure we don't really engage in as much anymore outside of sci-fi, where we're making up a lot of the details of travel and adventure.",DementedJ23,2016-06-12T01:07:34Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,87

My absolute favorite theme of the book came from the theme Van Helsing embodied. Namely, that a master of both the 'old' and 'new' worlds has the greatest advantage/power. None of the other characters at first had as much knowledge or advantage as Van Helsing did because he was one of the few (if not only) people who still bothered studying up on the 'old' sciences etc. He combined his knowledge of the old and archaic with the 'new' technology of the time to help effectively combat Dracula, and as the other characters are brought up to speed and team up, they gain in power.

4nl229_97,4nl229,"I read it in literature class, and it was an honors course so the teacher made us go pretty in depth with it. I think my favorite themes is feminism in the book. You look at the vampire women, who are the embodiment of sexually liberated, strong, powerful women, but they are viscous and evil.(radical, maneaters?)  Lucy, who before she becomes a vampire is the domesticated, pure, chaste woman. She's not too smart, and lives to serve the men in her life and really her existence is for men.

then you have Mina. She's smart, independent, she's pure (but it's more complicated than that). she's equally as capable, if not more, than Jonathan. A large majority of the book is revolved around the men trying to protect her, but the thing is that Mina really ends up helping and protecting the men more than they do her. she keeps them in check, and they treat her as a teammate, and a mother figure. she even uses her connection to Dracula to her, and the men's, advantage as a way to take him down. 

so if the vampire women are these radical, sexually liberated, man-eating ""feminist""(though not really) figures, and Lucy is the epitome of the ideal Victorian housewife, submissive, obedient, man serving... then what is Mina? what does she represent? How does her character's involvement and experiences throughout the book reveal about feminism and women being equal to men?(especially in that time) Is Mina a feminist icon or the exact opposite?

As for Bram Stokers inspiration, wikipedia seems to have this bit.

>Before writing Dracula, Stoker met Ármin Vámbéry, a Hungarian writer and traveler. Dracula likely emerged from Vámbéry's dark stories of the Carpathian mountains.[9] Stoker then spent several years researching European folklore and mythological stories of vampires. 

An example regarding werewolves, which kinda shows why it's so sad that we lost so much folklore:

>there are currently no known written accounts of Slavic mythology predating the fragmentation of the Proto-Slavic people into West, East, and South Slavs, with the possible exception of a short note in Herodotus’s Histories, mentioning the tribes of Budini and Neuri in the far north, whose men, supposedly transform themselves into wolves for several days each year although Herodotus is himself not convinced by this rumour, he stresses that he has heard some swear it.[1] Some researchers have interpreted this through the Slavic folk belief in werewolves, while others believe that Herodotus actually referred to ancient Slavic carnival festivals, when groups of young men roamed the villages in masks, sometimes referred to as vucari (wolf-humans). The identification of ""Neuri"" with Proto-Slavs remains controversial, however.

It's also interesting that you bring up LOTR, as Tolkien seemed to be saddened by the loss of mythology and folklore of pre-Anglo-Saxon England. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_paganism

>The pre-Christian society of Anglo-Saxon England was non-literate.[14] As a result of this, there is no contemporary written evidence from the period in which Anglo-Saxon paganism was actively being practiced.[15] Instead, our primary textual source material for understanding Anglo-Saxon paganism derives from later authors, such as Bede or the anonymous author of the Life of St Wilfrid, who were writing in Latin rather than in Old English.[16] These writers were not interested in providing a full portrait of the Anglo-Saxons' pre-Christian belief systems, and thus our textual portrayal of these religious beliefs is fragmentary and incidental.[",,2016-06-11T15:30:07Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,122

Stoker was always very moderate in his politics though, I don't think he really put that much though into deeper layers of the novel.",rollinggrove,2016-06-11T15:17:45Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,144

Mina is hard working and competent. She helps out in several ways including ways that you pointed out would be traditionally masculine. She's treated as a fairly straight forward member of the group and an asset. 

I find it oddly telling that in the 'modern' take on it they remove that intelligence and competence. I have the same issue with almost any portrayal of Irene Adler from Sherlock Holmes too.

Oh, and since you loved *Dracula* I recommend reading Stephen King's *'Salem's Lot*. It was published in 1975 and is actually his second published novel ever. In one of the most recent editions, King has written one of my favourite introductions to a book I have ever read. In it, he talks about the history of the book and how in some ways it's a modern retelling of *Dracula*. It has a lot of other inspirations as well (Invasion of the Body Snatchers for example) but King goes back to *Dracula* a fair bit. King says that when he was writing *'Salem's Lot* (at that time called The Second Coming) he thought that *Dracula* was too hopeful. He set out to write a vampire that would crush all humans that would opposed him. Anyways, here's a link: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5413._Salem_s_Lot?from_search=true&search_version=service you can look inside and read just the intro if you want.

Turn of the century Ireland was rife with anti-Semitism, as it was a means to become part of the 'in' group by oppressing others. See James Joyce's Ulysses for a depiction of this in literature. 

[The Limerick Boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_boycott) is an example of a notable contemporary anti-Semitic incident. ",,2016-06-11T17:23:37Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,177

Stoker was an Anglo-Irish Protestant who worked for Dublin Castle, he didn't need to seek out any groups to oppress.

Is it possibly Dracula is a racist Jewish caricature? Who knows, maybe. Is it likely? The fact that Stoker had no history of anti-semitism and had a terribly complicated ethnic identity of his own, on top of the threadbare evidence in the text itself, suggests not.",rollinggrove,2016-06-11T18:03:32Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,178
4nl229_179,4nl229,"Again, 'Anglo-Irish Protestant' does pretty much nothing to indicate that somebody isn't anti-Semitic. Colonial subjects often internalize the prejudices of the colonizer in order to assimilate. For an example of something similar, in the US,  the Irish were viciously racist against POC because it provided them with the opportunity to redirect racial/ethnic hatred and exclusion. 

 I don't think that Dracula is a racist Jewish caricature, I think that he, like many other instances of vampires in fiction, owes a lot of his roots to anti-Semitism. This doesn't mean that Bram Stoker is a die-hard anti-Semite, it just means that his fiction was a product of the times. As for the author themselves having a complex identity, I would again point you towards Ulysses--the depiction of anti-Semitism in Ireland that is presented in the book is far from lacking nuance, in fact it does a lot of work towards condemning Irish nationalism on the basis that it utilizes anti-Semitism to create an in group. [Quick Edit: Although Joyce wrote the novel in the 1920s, it's pretty clear that Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom are both author stand-ins at different stages of life projected onto 1904 Dublin because hindsight enables more effective social criticism, with Bloom working as a reaction against the Stephen that was presented in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man] 

I have a feeling that a lot of your arguments here are based on the assumption that claims regarding anti-Semitic content are tantamount to claims asserting the presence of anti-Semitic activism. This is not the case. Similarly, if I were to write a book set in present day America, there would be heavy inclusion of institutional and personal manifestations of racism against POC. That being said, it wouldn't necessarily indicate that I endorse those viewpoints, and could just as easily be used to subvert them. ",,2016-06-11T20:49:37Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,179

The one thing that kinda bugs me about it is that there are a bunch of plot contrivances that you may not notice on a first read through, but become apparent when you read it again and think really hard about it.

Dracula's ship accidentally comes ashore in a town that the girlfriend of the man who sold him the properties in England happens to be vacationing.

She is there with her best friend who happens to have a boyfriend (one of three) that runs an insane asylum right next door to one of the properties that Dracula bought.

He happens to be the student of the one man in all of Europe who knows how to defeat vampires.

If he'd landed in Portsmouth or Bristol or Liverpool, Dracula would have been free and easy.  If he'd even just eaten anyone but Lucy Westenra, Harker would have gone home and no one would have believed him about vampires.

The rest of the book is just a long, tedious anti-climax. The characters are dull, their piety ludicrous. Van Helsing and his pidgen English is irritating. Quincey Morris -- come on, there's a guy from Texas living in London in the 1800s? Why?

Ironically, that comes from Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" and was introduced to differentiate Orlok from Dracula and avoid a lawsuit from Stoker's estate. Although sunlight does weaken Dracula even in Stoker's book. An even earlier literary vampire was Lord Ruthven in Polidori's story [The Vampyre](http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/Vamp.shtml), which was actually responsible for a vampire craze in England and obviously influenced Stoker. But this vampire was not allergic to sunlight too.

So, even though I would agree that maybe Dracula isn´t on the NY Times best sellers or your local library´s ""hot section""; by no stretch do I think it doesn´t receive its deserved praise and admiration. I think of it as in music (well, not always. I just said it to illustrate the point, it´s not like every time I think of *Dracula* this comes to mind): maybe you love Porcupine Tree. But just because you don´t hear it blasting on every single stereo doesn´t mean there aren´t any fans out there enjoying them.

nrrkvc_16,nrrkvc,"I think it may be because the creations that it inspired heavily overshadow it now.  The original novel is a very slow, creeping horror where you have no idea what's going on for quite a while.  This probably appeals to some people.

Meanwhile, Dracula has been portrayed in pop culture as this evil Lord of Vampires who is extremely powerful right from the get-go.  There's no need to figure out who or rather what he is; you already know.  In this age, unfortunately, more people prefer the quick pop culture version as compared to the original slow mystery version.",the_card_guy,2021-06-04T06:02:28Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,16
nrrkvc_17,nrrkvc,"Dracula is not widely read anymore. Yes, it has had significant cultural influence, but I doubt that most people know the story anymore, just the character. Part of the reason for this is due to the style of writing being somewhat complex by modern standards, and the fact that Bela Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula overshadows the novel. 

Also, it is worth noting that Dracula has fallen out of favor in a post colonial literary landscape, as Dracula is largely representative of English xenophobia regarding the Ottomans.",olixius,2021-06-04T03:43:27Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,17
nrrkvc_18,nrrkvc,"You know we only have this book because of a drug-fueled orgy

EDIT: I feel I should explain this. In 1816, Mary Shelly (the future writer of Frankenstein) was engaged to her future husband Percy Shelly, and traveling Europe with both him and her stepsister. Her stepsister had had a fling with Lord Byron, and wanted to visit him at his estate on Lake Geneva. 1816 was also the “year without a summer” and because it was cold outside, Lord Byron decided that they should have a 4-way. Lord Byron’s personal physician was standing in the corner eating a pickle (not a euphemism). After sex, they all did a bunch of opium and Percy Shelly tripping balls eventually leads to a scary story contest. Lord Byron tells a story about a precocious vampire that bites people. Mary Shelly tells what she would eventually publish as Frankenstein. Later, Lord Byron’s personal physician writes down and publishes Lord Byron’s story and titles it “The Vampire”, which would later be the inspiration for Bram Stoker’s “Dracula”",Chancellor_Valorum82,2021-06-04T00:54:48Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,18
nrrkvc_19,nrrkvc,"Lay off OP. He might be younger than the average member of this sub. It would hardly surprise me if Stoker was overshadowed by the modern commercial vampire complex which has given us such gems as the never ending Twilight series—fittingly vampiric in itself, if for no other reason than it never tastes death. 

I think that Stoker’s influence is less evident in modern retellings of the vampire myth in that modern series make sex symbols: vampires are sports car driving, clubbing playboys with a temper who incidentally drink blood and live forever. To the extent that these can even be considered horror—I never feel fear as I watch them—these modern series resort to the occasional—or frequent—gory interlude—which is usually just viscerally disgusting, more than anything else—to punctuate horror, whereas Stoker was more artful about it. In Stoker’s version, the refinement is part of his coldness. Dracula’s attempts at hospitality leave Harker chilled. Dracula is equal parts aristocrat and literal horrifying monster—beastly and demonic, a true incarnation of evil. The latter is often very absent in modern series.",simon_darre,2021-06-04T04:04:59Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,19

You can see how Bram Stoker influenced Lovecraft ans future writers.. Even if they don't admit.

Story is sourced out of letters, journals and newspapers...

Protagonist loses his mind over seeing something supernatural.. Can't tell the difference between reality and dreams..

Only in Dracula.. It makes sense.

I don't understand why the dudes from in the mounts of madness lost their minds after seeing Cthulhu instantly..

But I can understand how Jonathan gradually drifts into madness after being locked in a maze tower for three months, with no concept of time and his only interaction an old manipulative weirdo that secretly prepares his food and makes his bed.

What I liked more, ia how the movie and the book both compliment and improve each other as well as present entirely different stories.

Most definitely have a look at Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu. It was written before Dracula and is a fantastic vampire story (tbh it's essentially lesbian vampires).

Similarly, The Blood of the Vampire by Florence Marryat is one of my favourites. Both are Gothic Fiction.

If you want Gothic outside of vampires, maybe have a look at stories like The Castle of Otranto (the first ever Gothic book and written by Walpole) or if you want something a bit more modern, perhaps The Turn of the Screw (James) or The Lifted Veil (Eliot) which is a short story.

Dracula basically summarizes English thoughts and fears in 1900:

- There's a massive subtext of immigration debate (Dracula=immigrating Jews. Coins, accent, nose, only enter when invited)

- there's the gender roles (cowardly men force-pretending to be brave, women forced to be used for their motherlyness)

- there's the adaptation of technology (primitive voice recordings).

I agree with E. A. Poe's review that the stories were a bit didactic and full of allegory, but the prose and tale telling was amazing.

Bram Stoker is a bit of an enigma to me. He wrote one of the best horror stories I've ever read (Dracula) and quite possibly the worst as well (The Lair of the White Worm). Dracula was all imagination, as Stoker based the castle on Castle Bran, not Poenari Castle (Vlad's actual fortress) having never visited either. Bran is a cramped, dark military border fortification, whereas Poenari is a partially restored ruin, but you can tell it was a lot more palatial and bright (but damn, all the steps to get up there!

(I also didn't have anyone to talk to when I first read Dracula. Those who liked to read weren't interested in it and everyone else didn't like to read. So like for the next few years, whenever I had to report on something I like for whatever class, I almost always spoke about the Dracula novel.)

Honestly though, I don't fully agree that the book is ""better than everything it produced combined"", emphasis on 'combined'. I think it's the BEST but I also think some adaptations and parodies have been pretty good and the novel itself could be intimidating to some people. (Though they still won't beat the novel.) I would love to see an extremely faithful adaptation to be honest.

As for why you might not hear about the book being talked about often, I think for starters, it's because Dracula is very popular and well-established in pop culture and has been for decades, so it might be one of those things people don't feel a need to discuss that much? Another might be because of its genre or because it's an epistolary novel? If I'm right, then I'd find that a bit sad because I'm always down to talk about Dracula lol.

If I compare the themes in Dracula to Conrad’s Heart of Darkness published 2 years later the difference is stark. Conrad’s got themes of exploitation, colonialism,imperialism etc that are obvious. I don’t need to be a 1900s Englishman or historian to understand it, In comparison I didn’t get any great theme or meaning from Dracula. 

Or you could compare Dracula to Frankenstein, the latter being a much deeper book in terms of undercurrents and themes throughout. 

I’d personally put Dracula in line with books like count of Monte Cristo or Don Quixote. good fun reads that have stood the test of time, inspired other tales and stories of a similar fashion. But hold no great meaning or significant themes.

But I re-read it with a more critical eye when I got older and was disappointed that it wasn't the high-quality literature that I remembered, lol. Then, it become much more interesting to look at the historical implications, like colonialism, racism, and women's roles.

Wolf's footnotes cover a whole bunch of ground. Sometimes they are adding historical context, sometimes reminding the reader of some minor thing that happened 200 pages ago, sometimes just dropping in a recipe for a dish mentioned in the text, stuff like that... but also sometimes just dropping the *snark*.

Here are some favorites of said snark. I'm spoilering these just in case, but they are all light and I've censored a couple character names to be extra cautious:

>!""The next instant, with a sinuous dive [Dracula] swept under ---'s arm, ere his blow could fall, and grasping a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw himself at the window."" [Footnote:] Satanic creature though he may be, in the real world Dracula is a pragmatist who knows the value of cash.!<

>!""Ah, that wonderful Madam ---! She has man's brain, a brain that a man should have were he much gifted, and a woman's heart."" [Footnote:] This is meant as a compliment.!<

And the ending was very anti-climatic, but it was at least realistic to the world Stroker had created, as a small group would stand no chance against Dracula, especially not in his home country.  

A few years back, I did watch a modern retelling of Dracula that was a limited series I found on Netflix. It has the castle and boat trip season, but turned the later conflict into a multigenerational one, where several generations of the survivors of the first half prepare for the arrival of Dracula in London, which the previous generation had managed to delay. It was pretty well done, though the ending took a left turn, choosing to go with a disappointing conflict resolution over what I thought they'd set everything up for.

The primary problem with the book is pacing; the first 50 pages in which Harker is running around Castle Dracula wondering what the fuck is going on and trying not to die are lightning in a bottle.

Then it shifts to 150 pages of looking out over the Whitby shores and seemingly endless blood transfusions.

Disclaimer: I worked in Whitby for a year. It’s got some nice views but stinks of fish, has no prospects and there’s a massive drug problem that the police just refuse to acknowledge.

The slow hunt across Europe is cool, the spiritual struggle of Mina is cool, the teamwork is cool. Dracula being passive in the climax of “Dracula” isn’t cool, and it’s fine to admit that.

I definitely agree with the pacing issue but I still like the the Lucy and Renfield chapters. I think that the book would have been better if we didn't know that Dracula was the cause of all of Lucy's problems. It was a problem of the reader knowing too much and getting frustrated with how the characters handled the situation. I read it three years ago but I remember Van Helsing putting out garlic and a maid throwing it away, and maybe locking the windows and someone else comes and opens them. When you know that Dracula is a Vampire and can turn into a bat then these moments lose a lot of their tension.

You’re free to like every part of it, I’m free to have different preferences.  Also, re dracula being too powerful to be defeated. The gang ran him off of his London lair, so it’s not like he’s unstoppable. That’s revisionism based on how belovéd Dracula has rightfully become in the meantime. In-story, he can be stopped from getting at Lucy by a shut window. Let’s not get out of control. Van Helsing has pieces of the true cross or whatever, there could easily be a scenario where they fight and kill Dracula.

That has been a foundational piece of my personal anthropology. Human beings, in our ordinariness, can be monsters.

17iabi3_1,17iabi3,"Regarding the gender stuff, I'd say Carmilla gets a few points for toying with the Very Victorian idea that ""beauty = goodness"". Seriously, the number of stories from that era, Dracula included, where you can immediately tell someone is trouble due to them not being conventionally attractive. It was an actual belief at the time that criminal or deviant behavior just sort of showed up on your face (Dorian Gray also plays with this). Nowadays we're used to the character of the ""femme fatale"", (only other example from the time I can think of is Milady from the Three Musketeers) but at the time Carmilla looking and acting like the sweetest and most innocent thing imaginable while actually being a monster was a bit subversive. Also she's a female character who is stronger and smarter than most of the males, so for the time that was a rarity too.

As for being sympathetic, she's still a monster, but whereas Dracula shows zero positive traits throughout the book, Carmilla has...a couple. Like showing a few signs of guilt for her actions, trying to rationalize herself as a part of nature, and just the fact that she was apparently a good person in life who can't help what she is. Whereas Dracula shows no remorse or complexity, and in life he was, well, actual maniac Dracula.

I wouldn't say it's a better book, Dracula does have the better plot. But Dracula as a character is just a Saturday morning cartoon supervillain. Every adaptation of him that has tried to add some nuance, guilt, or affection for his victim, is borrowing from Carmilla. She's a more interesting character in a less interesting story.",LupinThe8th,2023-10-28T16:06:08Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,1

17iabi3_5,17iabi3,"I think Carmilla is a great little book. It’s a much more intimate story than Dracula. And you get a much closer view of the predatory nature of the vampire. I think it is going to feel much more familiar to readers of modern (read post Interview with a Vampire) vampire stories. The ending is defiantly an anticlimax, I don’t think the Baron is completely to blame. Part of it is that our point of view character had no business in a monster fighting climax. Hard to fit in a non tragic climax with a protagonist like Laura. It’s also notable for being an early example of a beautiful and innocent looking monster that hunts by manipulating the assumptions people would make about such a “frail” creature. That angle would be very transgressive for the time.  The woman that dropped Carmilla off is also one of the most tantalizing unsolved mysteries of fiction. One thing I will say is that I’m not convinced the relation is meant to be lesbian. People, especially women, were a lot more physically interment in friendships at this point in history.  And I don’t think all of the affection starved women that preceded Laura as Mircalla’s victims would have been lesbians either. 

If Carmilla is a book that does what it does well. Dracula just does so much more. More technically complex and accomplished. Phenomenal use of the epistolary format. Way more themes delved into. I can’t go into all of it while I have said all I really have to say about Carmilla. One thing I will say though is that Dracula is a much more progressive book, both in intent and execution. It’s just that we’ve moved past a lot of the issues discussed in Dracula while two women cuddling is more controversial now than when Carmilla came out.",Lordfinrodfelagund,2023-10-30T16:18:08Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,5

Carmilla is good and fun to read, but it's almost hard to believe how Laura can still not put the pieces of the puzzle together even after hearing about Carmilla's (""Millarca's"")  previous victim. I couldn't believe that Laura was even happy to see Carmilla show up right after hearing the story from the old General -- was she really that slow on the uptake, or was she being mind-controlled by Carmilla and therefore couldn't reason logically?

The Vampyre is also a good read. I think I liked it about as much as Carmilla. It was better than Carmilla in the sense that the main (non-vampire) character Aubrey did put the clues together and realise the identity of the vampire. But it was worse than Carmilla because the ending was >!very tragic: Aubrey couldn't prevent the vampire from killing him and his sister, and the vampire got away!!<",milly_toons,2023-10-28T15:57:57Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,6

stoker's dracula by contrast started off strong. the writing was clearly on a higher plane than carmilla. carmilla's writing is like every other gothic ghost story the victorian era writers were churning out by the dozens. but dracula's writing was almost modern in its use of suspense. 

unfortunately, while i got further along in dracula than carmilla, i still did not finish it. the book bogged down significantly (for me) once scenery shifted to england. it was kind of hilarious how characters were introduced by the way their their brow bones were shaped, but made it hard to take things seriously. i know physiognomy was huge back then, but my god it did not age well.",quantcompandthings,2023-10-29T02:44:29Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,7

But I wouldn’t say Dracula is uninteresting. He’s an unrepentant bastard but the unyielding threat he poses works better for the story. And the arch vampire being the logical extreme of the feudal lord is interesting; more so now than it has been in a while. 

I will say I tend to enjoy Carmilla a lot more when she has shown up in later stories where as the Count I’ve never really felt worked as well outside of the novel, even in the stage play and it screen adaptations( I know he’s is the second most adapted chapter of all time. I stand by what I said). I think a large part of this is that almost every adaptation waters down the elemental evil that is Dracula, where as Carmilla does work better in a more character focused modern story.

164j544_4,164j544,"Protip: the book you actually wanted to read is *Carmilla*.

Not only was it written 26 years before Dracula, and partially inspired it, but it actually suits our modern ideas of vampires far better.

Carmilla is a major character in her book, ""on screen"" for most of it. She is charismatic, appealing, and attractive, unlike Dracula. She is capable of blending into society through cunning and deception, unlike Dracula. She also has romantic feelings for the human protagonist, shows signs of guilt for her actions, and seems to struggle with and regret her nature as a predator, but can't help what she is and tries to rationalize her deeds as just being part of nature. Even in the end, after she's been destroyed, the narrator admits that she sometimes views Carmilla as a monster, and sometimes remembers her as a friend. She's complicated and not 100% horrible, but capable of doing horrible things, because as a vampire she must.

If all this sounds like what modern vampires are like (including most adaptations of Dracula), there's a reason for that. Dracula has the more suspenseful and iconic plot, but other than that first act he's not much of a character. So when people wanted to tell stories about him that focused on him more, and gave him more of a personality, they naturally borrowed from that *other* vampire, the one who is actually fun.

(Also, Carmilla is *queer as fuck*, so you can see why through most of the 20th century Hollywood was a little leery of adapting her too closely).

Oh, and it's a novella under a hundred pages in length and you can polish it off in an afternoon. No padding in this one, the story is nice and brisk.

Initially I was a little put off by it's focus then on Mina but eventually came to like it. Once Lucy died it went downhill. Didn't mind them hunting down Lucy, but after they formed a team it went mid for me. Mina was pushed to the side, Dracula who should have had his time to shine was kind of just the guy they were hunting rather than the powerful, intelligent master of the night. As far as we know he just never hunted anyone in England other than Lucy and Mina; I wish they went more into other victims. Last third of the book felt dragged, it was all about hunting down Dracula to the point the characters didn't feel characters anymore, more just extensions of eachother.

Overall I wish Stoker looked more into Renfield, his background and motivations beyond just madness, but mostly Van Helsing and Dracula. The rivalry could have been gone into further and the characters fleshed out more than just Van Helsing leading and Dracula as just the bad guy after he was so well set up in the first chapters. I wish Jonathan was also further fleshed out,  lot of the book seems to put aside that he's the only one to meet Dracula for half the book.

However, her actual inner narration frequently mentions how glad she is to be a good obedient wife, and takes jabs at feminists. There's also a certain... thing that happens later in the book that could have been completely avoided had the men not unanimously agreed that she be kept out of this, since women are not able to handle this kind of business (despite the fact that to get to this stage, she had to handle this kind of business, and very well at that). Something really bad happens as a direct result of the ""stay in the kitchen"" attitude. And the narration, even Mina's own, never blames the men. Nobody ever says ""Oh no, our narrow views on the role of women has led to this terrible thing"", even though it's really obvious that's what happened. They never admit to a mistake.

Women were more or less totally closed off from higher education and any institutions of note beyond auxiliary roles like secretaries.

Declaring something fully feminist or misogynist is just like. Not a useful way to do anything. For these purposes, feminism would be a critical lens through which to examine the work - one which should probably also work hand-in-hand with a historical lens for a book 100 years old. There's going to be elements of both. It was written by a man a hundred years ago. Just by that alone there's going to be problematic stuff in it, never mind the actual contents of he story. However, as any of the dracula daily tumblr girlies will tell you, there's also plenty of character work that resonates strongly with a modern feminist audience that has good points to take away, especially depending on your interpretation.

Edit: Skimming some of the other comments has made me realize some of the words I want to use for this- I would say that *judging* dracula through a modern lens is probably misguided (though ngl I do thoroughly judge the twists several adaptations have made ever since that do make it MORE misogynistic imo), however I think *analyzing* it through a modern lens gives you all sorts of complicated answers to your question!",math-is-magic,2023-11-30T12:29:13Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,3
18734px_4,18734px,"Stroker wrote in the style that was common at the time. With how gender roles were seen and done at THAT time.  In society at that time women were seen to a point as delicate creatures. Especially those women who were upper middle class to upper upper class. Same goes for the various words that were in use at the time. He also took time to research the real person behind the fiction. So it can not be seen in many ways as being misogynistic. Due to the standards of that time vs current time.

What many folks do not realize. Is that Dracula was based on a real person. Vlad III. Who had a long bloody history. He also had a total of three wives. Not all three at the same time. Which Stroker placed in the books as the three female vampires that are in the castle that Renfield visited. He was the ruler of Wallachia. The thing is, he was super religious in his own way. He had built several churches, nunneries, priories, etc... 

I would say that the using of the stake to impale the vampires in the story came from how he treated various folks. If injured in front. he would see that person as being a warrior. If injured in the back. the person would be impaled due to him seeing that person as a coward. And the item of impalement entered the body from the anal area and thru the mouth.

While it's true that people who don't know what they're talking might respond to this post, that's a totally different issue than posting the discussion itself. There are people who have a better idea who also can access this forum and post.

>For an example (and I'm totally making this up) someone might find a quote that Bram Stoker said the l that his wife should stay home and look after the kids. And then use that as an argument for his mysogeny. When really, that was in fact the societal norm of the time. Everyone would have said that.

That's misogynistic regardless of societal norms, just fyi, but wouldn't necessarily preclude Stoker having more progressive thoughts as well (and doesn't single him out as being especially woman-hater-y). I don't think people having a knee-jerk reaction to information means we should curb other people sharing their thoughts or knowledge. Yeah, some people suck, but why limit ourselves because someone else might get offended? That's their problem.

I guess, in summation, I don't understand the idea of getting pre-offended because someone else might get offended, but to each their own.

  
For what it's worth (if you or anyone else is curious), there's evidence that Florence was in many ways Stoker's working partner during his life and is, of course, known for her defense of Dracula. I know she managed all their affairs during the end of Stoker's life, too, which he praised her for to his friends.

The historical context is that the Romani people were very negatively stereotyped during Bram Stoker's day and had lots of connections to the occult and other ungodly practices in the way they were depicted in popular culture.

11fiwer_1,11fiwer,"This is simple

It's not a language issue but a plant cultivar issue.

The word eggplant in Dracula is referring to a specific cultivar of the plant. It's from this cultivar we get the general name eggplant.

This cultivar is white and looks like an egg growing out of the plant. It's not a very creative name.  It is not purple and it was popular in the west starting around 1760 then puttered out as other cultivars came about. The name caught on because it was very popular and could be produced to meet demand.

What happened?

The word eggplant became generalized to mean all in North America after this cultivar of the plant became popular. Why? to not be British.

What about aubergine?  In the UK the upper class adopted the French word to be posh, as they often did, and the rest followed so yeah. IF memory serves the original name in English for eggplant was madde.

The big fat purple thing we know and love? that is a cultivar known as Black Beauty and  it's only around 100 years old. It's a product of the early 20th century and it became common because it produces multiple large fruit and ships well so it eclipsed all other cultivars of the day for a long time.",that_other_goat,2023-03-02T00:34:53Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,1

Fellow Australian here who also uses 'eggplant', but my mother, who is from India, says 'aubergine'. Like the other Aussie commenter, I know what the word aubergine means, but have never heard anyone else use it. The spelling 'egg-plant', hyphenated, seems to be an old fashioned one.

I always assumed that Dracula picked a house so close to the asylum because the minds of those within would be easy to bend, and who would believe a mentally ill person who said a tall dude in a black cloak materialized under the door and drank his blood in the night?

Renfield was just the mind that ended up bending first, or most usefully. If he was so important, I don't think Dracula would've cast him aside so powerfully that it killed him when he came to get Mina.",CSEngineAlt,2023-06-16T16:27:28Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,11
14aw5hq_12,14aw5hq,"It's implied in the book that he can have some sort of mental control over people who are susceptible in various ways.  Lucy was a sleepwalker, Renfield was insane.

 It's pretty common in horror stories as well as in real life superstitious or religious beliefs for people to think that certain conditions could make a person vulnerable to supernatural influence or able to communicate with supernatural beings. That's why youll find stories about how epileptic people or disabled people or insane people have connections with the paranormal, sometimes as victims or as seerers etc.

So It's nothing specific to Renfield. Anywhere Dracula mightve traveled he would've influenced or made connections with someone like that who knew what he was and could communicate with him. Renfield just happened to be there, if it had been another place it would've been another person as there are insane people everywhere.  

It's possible theyd met before, only don't remember the book saying this though. I recall that it was Draculas first time in England?? But who knows, it really doesn't matter. 

Renfield,  like Van Helsing, knew what vampires are (probably as a result of his condition which made him sensitive to that sort of thing) and Dracula started to communicate with him as he was approaching England, still on the ship. This does not require them to have known one another before, but it's irrelevant to the story if they did or not.

Note the similar pattern with Lucy due to her sleep walking.

Renfield is in the role that we might call a familiar. He wants Dracula to make him a vampire and so he'll help him and serve him. You can see why it might be useful for Dracula to look for people like this anywhere he goes.

One more thing, Dracula does not go to Whidby bc Renfield was there. He had already planned the trip to England, it's why he brought Harker to the castle in the first place, to help him prepare. But he went to Whidby specifically as opposed to elsewhere in England bc of Mina and revenge on Harker. That's why he toyed with Lucy so long too.

It's very sad how modern media has diluted this classic story of good vs evil and popularised the romantic, sexy, tragic hero vampire.

18xnj1l_6,18xnj1l,"Yes, men penetrating men, or women penetrating men, is part of the exciting sexual depravity depicted in the story. Dracula also embodies some of the Victorian stereotypes of homosexual men, such as very red lips, shockingly-pale skin, white and fine hands, and the ability to fight physical force with enchanting charm. He's also the only creature capable of producing more vampires, which makes him a perverse kind of mother figure. But gender-bending sexual imagery is not the only Victorian fear Stoker works into the story.

*Dracula* also raises fears of sexually-transmitted disease, which was a huge problem in Victorian England but a taboo subject. It was often discussed in coded language, though, and vampirism may have been one of those codes. Sexually-transmitted diseases were often assumed to be a byproduct of sexual depravity.

The character of Dracula also bore a resemblance to stereotypes about Jews, many of whom came to England from Eastern Europe in the 19th century due to antisemitic Russian pogroms. There's a very old stereotype among Christians in Europe that Jews use the blood of young Christians for ritual purposes. Jews were also stereotypically depicted as wealthy. They stereotypically dressed strangely, spoke with accents, and had no allegiance to any country.

Dracula also raises fears of Romani, commonly known by the slur gypsies. The traveling Romani who had no permanent home or job were thought to be thieves not only of money and objects but also of children. They were thought to live like animals. 

In short, Stoker's *Dracula* reveals a lot about what Victorian English readers secretly feared. They feared aggressive and seductive sexual deviants, Jewish immigrants, Romani immigrants -- in short, ""otherness.""",wjbc,2024-01-03T17:25:56Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,6

The vampire women in the castle are a straightforward metaphor for sexuality, and the Count wants Harker all to himself... there's a lot of coded sexuality in general in the novel. Lucy is a fairly obvious example of that, as is the idea of vampires drinking blood - it's a kind of penetration.

It helps if you look at what came before *Dracula* (1897). *Carmilla* (1872), the archetypal 'lesbian vampire' story, and *The Vampyre* (1819), whose titular character is based on Lord Byron, noted socialite, bisexual, and accumulator of scandals ('mad, bad, and dangerous to know' was coined about him).

Stoker himself is believed to have been gay - there are some letters from Walt Whitman which hint at that quite heavily - and though there are obviously other themes he's dealing with in *Dracula*, there's been a lot of academic writing on whether/how he's filtering his own grappling with sexuality through the work.",TigerHall,2024-01-03T16:50:30Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,14

It was really cool to experience the gaps in the characters’ writing, like going several days without an email and thinking “hmmm, seems suspicious that we haven’t heard from Jonathan in awhile…”

This was my first time reading Dracula, and I liked how sometimes there’d be updates every day, and sometimes nothing for a week or two, and sometimes the update would be just a sentence or two, sometimes much more (although I’ll admit, that 50-page update was a doozy!). It was a fun way to read a classic novel I’d otherwise probably not have read, and I think Dracula was uniquely suited for the format (I know a lot of others are setting up similar substacks, and I’m even subscribed to a couple, but I don’t think the experience with Dracula Daily is duplicable).

I think the community/book club feel on tumblr also had a huge role in my enjoyment. The slow pace really allowed people to read deeply and follow along with what was happening. People would pick up on random details, explain dated references, make art and memes, and do actual literary analysis, and it added a lot of depth to the reading experience. Plus, it was fun to have others reacting to the same updates at the same time. I do plan to read Dracula again sometime in its traditional format, but I’m glad I read it first as part of Dracula Daily.

In fact, I hated the book, despite loving most Victorian literature I read and Dracula movie adaptations and everything vampire-related. The book was so repetitious, melodramatic, and the characters did not act logically. And the treatment of women was unlike anything I had read by a Victorian author before—how Lucy and Mina were basically worshipped but also demeaned. I mean it's not a surprise given the time period, but it just made it difficult for me to enjoy.

Van Helsing does have a conversation with Dr. Seward about mysticism, and whether or not he believes in various metaphysical concepts, precisely to emphasize Dr. Seward's scientific mind and his skepticism, and Van Helsing's acknowledgement of certain forces being outside the realm of science.

Quincy only became involved because he loved Lucy, and it was seeing her and what she became that helped convince him of the necessity of taking out Dracula.

Like there's that stupid idea about the blood transfusions that made its way into that *Dracula Tapes* book, where Van Helsing was actually killing Lucy with mismatched blood types and Dracula *actually* turned Lucy into a vampire to save her life. Never mind that the book *Dracula* makes it very obvious that the blood transfusions *did* work, that she felt better afterwards, and that her relapse into illness was entirely because of Dracula coming back and draining all the blood out of her again and again.

He's the Obi Wan. Stoker might also have intended him to play a comic relief role with all his mis-translations of English slang and phrases.

Mina is definitely not presented as a damsel in distress. She is intelligent and self possessed, traits that are often commented on by the rest of the characters. Although Van Helsing has the knowledge of vampire lore, Mina seems to be one step ahead of everyone when it comes to what is actually going on. She knows that the group's friendship, and collaboration is stronger than Dracula. Even with all his supernatural power, he is weaker than them because he is alone. Van Helsing agrees, saying something like, ""We must always work together."" But then when Van Helsing takes the men to kill Dracula, he ignores his own advice, leaving Mina behind, where Dracula is able to attack her. I think Mina is the one who suggests they can use her psychic link with Dracula and follow him back to his castle if Van Helsing hypnotizes her. Most importantly, Mina convinces the men that they are not on a mission of  vengeance, but instead a mission of mercy.

You as a reader *know* that Dracula isn’t going to kill Harker in the beginning, because then who would be there to tell the story? 

So a lot of the “And then I sneaked back into this room and decided to write this all down” thing kills the suspense for me. 

There’s always a part whenever I reread Dracula that I end up rooting for him to just eat everyone, because I’m so bored and tired of the story. And then inevitably, a few years later, I think “It can’t possibly be as bad as I remember it being, it’s a classic, I should give it another chance.” 

I am determined to break the cycle this time. The last time that I read it will be the last time I ever read it.",pm_me_poemsplease,2021-11-19T22:32:05Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,3

qxnq7l_5,qxnq7l,"I agree. Could have been a good book, if the first part of the novel between Harker and Dracula were isolated, along with Dracula on the boat. Those are great parts, but the rest of the story should have gone for a more ""horror"" route, instead of trying to dispel the horror of invading vampires.

>!Cuz that's definitely what it tries to do: Van Helsing serves as an academic voice of reason, dispelling any ignorant peasant fear that Dracula might possess any power that can't be surmounted. Because of that, Dracula comes off as a weakling who just doesn't kill anybody, while Van Helsing and his crew are unstoppable in their hunt. Heck, Vamp Lucy goes on a bigger rampage than Dracula.!<

>!Perhaps, rather, the book could retain it's ""epistolary notes and fragments"" format, by having it jump between many different, non-related characters, AS Dracula is successfully spreading terror in London. I like the concept of the epistolary letters. It CAN make the world feel bigger. If the book went for this route, and ended with the people in a ravaged London discovering Dracula as the cause too late... That would be a lot more horrifying than what we got.  And afterall, London has dealt with disease oriented pandemics prior to Dracula's publishing. !<",GlossyBuckthorn,2021-11-19T23:08:00Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,5

I was also struck by just how good of an adventure story it was. I just got done with Frankenstein before I read this, which was much less plot based, more philosophical and psychological.

181w0cy_1,181w0cy,"If someone ever asks me for an argument against teaching English literature in high schools, I'm just going to show them this post.

It's a horror story about a monster who eats people. What it is trying to say is: 'I'm exciting, buy me!'

Okay, so it's not entirely devoid of subtext. Stoker wrote at a time when Britain was receiving what was, for the time, a large number of immigrants from Eastern Europe. You can, if you want to be simplistic, reduce the core of the novel down to: Eastern Europe immigrant comes to London, sexually assaults pure English girl. 

But there isn't a political *message*; Stoker wasn't trying to make a comment on the political problems of the day, he was just trying to riff on themes that would resonate with his audience.

And if your interpretation is an illustration of the dangers of exposing the unprepared brain to too many English literature classes, it's also an example of why we need more, and better, history teaching. Because you don't seem to understand the Victorian mindset at all.

Britain at the end of the 19th century was the richest, most technologically advanced nation on the planet, and perhaps with the exception of the United States it was one of the most socially progressive, too. For a 19th century understanding of the term 'social progress', that is. You're trying to project a modern understanding of the word 'conservative' back onto a time when it doesn't really fit.

Dracula represents the old world. The superstitious, feudal, Medieval societies still widespread across Europe in Stoker's day. Jonathan Harker and his friends are very deliberately presented as middle class: a growing part of English society but still very much not the norm elsewhere. A lot of Europe was still divided between peasants and landed gentry, especially the further east you went. It was one of the big complaints by the British against immigrants that they were ignorant and superstitious. 

Dracula is served by gypsies who were bound to him by custom and religious fear. But Harker is neither a grovelling serf nor a (literally) bloodsucking aristocrat. The upper classes had always looked down on anyone who actually worked for a living, but Harker has a respectable career (as does Mina); he doesn't draw his income from the toil of others, but nor is he anyone's servant. The theme is modern, progressive Victorian Britain vs. dark, regressive feudalism. 

Trying to project our modern dichotomy between 'liberal = pro sexual freedom' and 'conservative = anti sex' doesn't really work for this time period. Sexual continence was a middle class virtue; having babies out of wedlock was what poor people did, and being sexually promiscuous was what decadent aristocrats did (see: Lord Byron). Lucy becomes sexually promiscuous when she becomes a vampire because she has lost her moral sense.

But again, I cannot emphasize enough how Stoker was not trying to make any kind of political commentary. These are all things that would have been implicitly understood by his audience and were used by Stoker to add depth to what is at heart a traditional monster tale, rather than the story serving merely as framework for a metaphor (like Frankenstein, for example).",WRickWrites,2023-11-23T16:02:19Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,1
181w0cy_2,181w0cy,"I read Dracula as quite a conservative text that, as you say, has a lot of fears of 'the Orient' and what it might do to a 'civilized' Victorian society (corrupt our women, enfeeble our men, etc). I don't think the fact Mina has training or education undermines that effect - nor does the portrayal of the male characters. 

The discourses we have about values in our society are imperfect and fragile: ideas about gender, for example. We can all reel off the tropes of what men and women should be like. And we all know that in practice, no individual meets that standard of behaviour/character/presentation. But we have a rigid set of idealised tropes that are, by definition, impossible for us to ever fully actualise. This is like Derrida's practice of deconstruction & double reading - any discourse always already contains the seeds of it's undoing within itself. So, Dracula can contain these contradictions (and must contain these contradictions) - that doesn't necessarily undermine your reading of it/the overall message. It just means that any act of making meaning (writing a story, for example) will contain tensions within its narrative.

So, while Mina might be educated (which fits with progressive middle class aspirations of white, Victorian womanhood at the time) and the men can and do emote (Jonathan in particular is at risk of falling under Dracula's 'spell', too, in the early novel) at the end of the day, it's the good old heterosexual, middle class, monogamous family that is 'saved' from these threatening, vampiric others.",missoranjee,2023-11-23T14:06:05Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,2
181w0cy_3,181w0cy,"I don’t know how fast a reader you are but it really might be worth comparing it to The Beetle, the other big horror novel published the same year that actually sold more copies and was more critically acclaimed then Dracula. It’s also got an innovative structure— not epistolary but with each section from the pov of a different character— and it’s also got this eastern thing going on, in The Beetle an Egyptian cult, and it’s also got sexual danger for the independent female character. So then instead of looking deep inside Dracula and trying to find something that was never meant to be there, you can actually talk about the book as the money maker it was meant to be but – and this is still true – of course any book like that is going to draw on things that people find exotic, interesting, or frightening. So it says something about the reading public at the time.

181w0cy_4,181w0cy,"I haven't read Dracula, but I've seen from your comments that you need to figure out a meaning for school. 

The cool thing is, there is no wrong answer. 

Your idea of it being about purity / sin / change etc. - you said you got confused using this metaphor because when you categorised people as 'good' and 'bad', they still ended up facing the same fate. That could be a metaphor all on it's own. 

You could write about how Stoker was trying to say that change happens in life wether you're ready to embrace it or not and no matter how good and pure, or bad and impure someone is, everyone faces the same fate (death). Dracula represents change and he comes for everyone and people react differently but their outcomes are seemingly unrelated to their reactions - just like life. So ultimately, you might as well strap in and embrace change because being happy in the moment is all that you can control. 

I dunno. Like I said, I haven't read the book, I'm giving that analysis just based on your post, but it seems vague enough that you could probably justify it without being contradicted?",TheRecklessOne,2023-11-23T17:21:02Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,4
181w0cy_5,181w0cy,"I think it's notable Bram Stoker started writing Dracula during the trial of Oscar Wilde, who was convicted of having sexual encounters with other men. The writers had known each other a long time, even fighting over the same woman in their youth, despite both being interested in men, and possibly both being gay. It's harder to say with Bram Stoker, but he wrote quite an incriminating letter to Walt Whittman, who himself wrote very suggestive poetry about men and had relationships with them. Bram Stoker also tried to remove all references to Oscar Wilde from his own writing and correspondence following the trial. Keep in mind Oscar Wilde's own book (The Picture of Dorean Grey) was used as evidence against him. Knowing that is going to potentially impact how other LGBTQ+ writers wrote, especially those who could be associated with him, like Stoker. 

So, this book was likely written by a closeted writer, who feared imprisonment or worse, if he ever acted on his desires. It very notably and repeatedly promotes heteronormative structures as ideal in way that is unusual even for the period. Heteronotitivity is something the character of Dracula directly threatens. The first part of the book Bram Stoker wrote was Dracula defending Harker from the female vampires. This is the part where Dracula says he loves Harker and 'this man is mine.' This is potentially quite telling. You could easily read the book as a story about internalised homophobia, where Dracula represents (unwanted) male same sex attraction. Dracula has some potential similarities to Oscar Wilde, in fact, and it does involve a fight over women between Dracula and the male heroes.

The close male relationships themselves are interesting in terms of this interpretation. They could be read as an attempt to show close male bonds which are most definitely not sexual, because all the heroic thing the men do are very definitely for women, not for each other. While there is an element of being able to break social norms of traditional masculinity or femininity, it is only up to a point. This something LBGTQ+ people in particular would acutely aware of.

In terms of 'social fear,' the fear of unacceptable sexual desire as rooted in the period, and notable from the trial of Oscar Wilde, could be a consideration, but it also possibly the book speaks to the very specific fears and turmoil's of an LGBTQ+ writer during a period of persecution.",Willowtreegarden,2023-11-24T21:57:50Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,5
181w0cy_6,181w0cy,"To be honest with you, when I was using the terms conservative and liberal, I wasn’t exactly using them in a political way, at least that’s not what I had in mind. I was using them to portray a group that was more open minded / progressive vs a group that wasn’t as open minded / wanted to stick to traditional ideas in terms of the Victorian view. Though, I suppose that’s my own fault for not elaborating more? And yes, I’m aware that Stoker may have only written it for his own and others entertainment. But like you said, the environment / surroundings of his time could still influence the themes he wrote about (which I mentioned in a comment to another). 

I know Victorian society at the time had progressive groups / circles, though, I believe, traditional ideas when it came to gender roles still existed / were the norm (men being part of the working class / inherently masculine, and women sticking to the domestic life / motherhood). Although, I am aware some women at this time (especially of those progressive (mid class) circles) were able to obtain education, and men were obviously able to grieve (though, because of gender roles, kind of looked down upon to do so in public / when not appropriate). 

And what I mean with modern tech is stuff like the blood transfusions or the phonograph. Blood transfusions weren’t exactly new, but they weren’t that researched into, and the first transfusion on a human wasn’t somewhere until around the early 1800s. And the phonograph wasn’t exactly used until the late 1800s. But you are right, Britain was quite technologically advanced by the time the early 1900s hit. The mid-late 1800s kind of made a little pathway with these inventions for Britain to be that way. I just felt, at the time Stoker had written *Dracula*, these inventions were somewhat new for Victorian society at the time. 

And in terms of sexuality, I feel like the ideals of Victorian society at the time was all about morals. So, I thought (putting on these ideas together), perhaps Stoker was trying to say something about the group of Victorians who adhered to these ideals / morals that were promoted at the time and maybe what they viewed about those more progressive ideas (Dracula) vs the group of Victorians who weren’t so caught up / engaged with these ideals and favored change a lot more (Van Helsing and Co.). Or maybe even Victorian ideals / expectations vs. the reality of the time. Perhaps you can even make the argument for mid class vs upper class. Basically more social commentary than political.


In terms of the regression you mentioned, yeah, Eastern Europe wasn’t as developed compared to the west, but I also feel that idea could maybe apply to my interpretation since, wasn’t there a fear of regression within certain parts of Victorian society?

But yeah, progressive Victorian society vs regressive feudalism does make sense, and does make the contradictions I was having problems with easier to understand.",IKnowWutYouDid,2023-11-23T18:00:32Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,6

181w0cy_9,181w0cy,"Sorry that people aren’t meeting your energy on this. There has never been a successful horror story that DIDN’T tap into some sort of societal fear. Many of them are situated in the time they were written. There are a select few that stand the test of time, because they are centered on fears that are universal. But even the Freddie Krueger movies were fairly clearly an allegory for puberty and sexual awakening. That time when your body starts responding in ways you never considered or intended. That’s why they were good. The straight slasher movies were centered on the fear of the sexual revolution, and whether that made victims responsible for the rise of famous serial killers in the 60’s and 70’s. They haven’t aged as well, for that reason. They’ve instead been satirized or updated. It Follows is basically a supernatural std, but it isn’t accompanied by the victim-blaming from Jason movies. 

Dracula is one of the rare ones that was scary in its time, and it’s still relevant today. The idea that “it’s just a story that sounded scary” is.. well, that’s fine if people don’t want to examine the why. But it’s weird to me that they are trying to dissuade you from it, unless people dislike using Reddit for homework help. But I appreciate that you added your thoughts, and you spent some time on them (as opposed to just trying to ask about themes). 

You aren’t the first (or will be the last) person to interpret Dracula as bringing new ideas to a conservative society. But I think it can trip you up to equate the good/evil and purity/sin angle. One of the themes of the book is that you CAN’T swap those on these characters. Mina can be physically impure without being morally impure. It was a pretty big distinction to make in Victorian society. Likewise, acknowledging that temptation is not the same as falling. I assume most people in Victorian society were aware of these things. They were human, after all. But all societies have ways of viewing themselves, promoting themselves. And there were several authors during this decade who wrote stories of the “fallen” who didn’t deserve to be thrown out. How easily these characters could have “fallen,” when they were really both victims and fighters. Thomas Hardy had been making it a theme in this same time. 

Dracula is also the book that set us on the sexy-scary-vampires trajectory that has never left us. We might have gotten there on our own, but this book was a watershed moment.",westkms,2023-11-23T22:20:38Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,9

(How annoying were Van Helsing speeches...)

I highly suggest Carmilla from Sheridan Le Fanu to anyone interested in vampire stuff.

He's more Smaug than Spike- not so much a complicated Man with Feelings, but a beast. A spiteful, greedy, clever, powerful beast; but a beast just the same.

For me, it's a bit less of a book about a ~vampire~ and more of a book about friendship, and married nerds being in love, and Bram Stoker having clearly never interacted with a Texan in his entire life, and a profoundly Victorian excitement about using SCIENCE!!!!! to combat evils we've never understood.

Unless I’m missing something, the social commentary in Dracula is obvious to the point of being ham-fisted. Immigrants! Sexuality! The role of women! Yeah, I know. Again, other Victorian writing handles these in more interesting and complex ways.

While I personally consider period delineations to be rather artificial—it’s not like everything everyone was doing in literature turned on a dime in 1837—I assumed you meant Mary Shelley, who also is typically considered part of the Romantic era, since that’s when she wrote the majority of her work (including Frankenstein, 1818).",WyldeBoar,2020-09-02T00:41:25Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,11

I find it funny that you have a problem with period delineation, but then turn around and try to use it to make a point. Shelley is thematically victorian. You could say post-romantic goth if you wish but the only reason she is sometimes classed as romantic is by association. Anyways delineations are not really as fixed as people seem to think.
And with regards to ""unless I'm missing something"", well yes. You are. You listed out HS themes, which leads me to believe you have recently started studying Lit and have a larger than warranted opinion of you understanding.

If Mary Shelley is “only...romantic by association,” the “association” in question is the fact of her having written her major works prior to Queen Victoria’s coronation. If you want to claim her as part of a “long Victorian era,” fine, that works.

She makes no mention of Lucy looking wan and sickly at that point. (Both of these are in Chapter VII

The sleep walking I think is being established as a pattern of behavior that Lucy had way prior to Count Douchebag pulling up in merry olde England and that was how she even became vulnerable to being exposed to his influence to begin with.

We're currently leaving a weird century long blip where that was not the case.

I think Herodotus recorded one army battalion sobbing in joy together after seeing the ocean for the first time after a war.

g1t1db_4,g1t1db,"I think this take on *Dracula* comes up a lot on this sub.  I'm not sure many people consider the book a literary classic, because there are large sections of it that are real rough and not very fun to read.  I don't think the thing has endured because of Bram Stoker's writing.  Even as pulp fiction it's not incredibly tight.

I think Stoker does a couple of things well.  First, it's an epistolatory novel that's written from several different perspectives in methods that aren't just letters.  There are journals, letters, reports, and telegrams.  I'm not clever or well-read enough to know if this was the first book that made that stylistic attempt, but I thought it was a neat idea and gave *Dracula* a ""found document feel.""  Second, and this sub is wild about this shit, it's Stoker's world-building.  World-building is overhyped as a skill here, but Stoker, by hook or by crook, stumbled onto something with this one.

*Dracula* endures largely because of the culture cache attached to this ""world-building.""  A lot of modern-day vampire lore can be sourced back to that book.  It was incredibly popular when it was first published.  I think critics compared him to Mary Shelley (which... nah, not even close), thought it was a great novel, and thought Bram Stoker was a new literary force.  I think it's... okay.  People still *talk* about it because it is this vampire ur-text.  The politics of the story are dated, he has a real problem with a dragging plot (which is a big deal when you're essentially writing a pulp adventure), and his decisions getting increasingly simplistic as the protagonists get closer to their confrontation with Count Dracula.

Stoker was a theatre guy, apparently a pretty good one, and I think that's why the story keeps getting adapted.  Its actual plot is strong.  I don't think the thing is terrible by any means, it's just not a transcendent masterpiece or anything like that.

Every adaptation does Lucy dirty though.",TomBombomb,2020-04-15T17:30:16Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,4

eoeufo_1,eoeufo,"I've heard this complaint a lot. Many people share your view, and I can understand why--those chapters in Dracula's castle are the most well-remembered for a reason.

Personally, I really like the chapters in Whitby. There's strong dramatic irony as we the reader knows more about what's happening than the characters do. We know what happened to the Demeter, and what the ""large dog"" was that came ashore. We know who the mysterious figure is that Lucy met on the cliffs, and we know what is draining her of life and energy. The characters know nothing, and the tension between our knowledge and theirs builds suspense.

Add to that the fact that the two most interesting and entertaining characters in the book (Renfield and Van Helsing, respectively) come into play in these chapters and the result is pretty captivating.

It's a bit slower in the middle in England than it is in Transylvania in the beginning and end, but there's plenty to be savored, IMHO.",aesir23,2020-01-14T02:58:12Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,1

eoeufo_8,eoeufo,"It's an [epistolary novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistolary_novel), told entirely through letters and ephemera. So the reader has to do the work of a narrator, in a sense, as if *you* were the person who has learned the story from these materials.

The original *Dracula* novel leaves a lot on the table, in a way. The ending is a little under-developed, and there is enough world-building so more stories can be generated by a creative storyteller. Hence, it has been adapted many times, each version or spin-off superimposes a new unique vision. Scorcese's film added more to Dracula's backstory as a warlord and the tragedy of his wife's suicide, and added a more complete and satisfying ending. The latest BBC 3-part series is a huge departure, basically a whole new story, but all the important original elements are present.

Stoker's book is an excellent framework, but it takes some imagination to fill it up, to flesh out the details; and there is no definitive correct way to do that,  as we can see in its many adaptations. As reading material, it gives you something more to do than passively receive the information.

I first read Dracula when I was probably 10-ish and I'm currently rereading it 13 years later, so I forgot if he lived or not (I forgot most of what happened specifically in the book). I was genuinely dying to know what happened to Harker. I'm only about 30% through it, but so far there hasn't been anything telling me a character definitely lives. I've probably just read too much gothic fiction, but it doesn't seem odd to me that these people are keeping detailed diaries.

I attempted to read it multiple times as a teen and couldn't get through it but absolutely loved it as an adult. I think this is because maturer audiences are able to appreciate the nuances of the novel and the gothic atmosphere Bram Stoker crafted. We're also likely to have read more and therefore have a wider vocabulary and understanding of the language that's used. *Dracula* is also very different from the modern vampire novel and I think that could be why younger readers sometimes struggle with it. Stoker's depiction of vampires is traditional and much more subtle yet grotesque. Dracula as a character isn't in your face; he's omnipresent. You can't see him, but you *feel* him at all times.

As for differentiation of the characters, the males I found shared a number of characteristics as mentioned by OP. However, I also felt that each had their own distict traits and history that made them unique. Van Helsing being the wise mentor from a foreign land, Dr Seward being the clinical psychologist, Arthur being the well off vengeful husband etc.

43owab_8,43owab,"I agree with your assessment. This book is great when Dracula is actually in it, which is surprisingly little. The parts when he is on a ship, and the poor crew don't know what is going on, are especially chilling.

I think you have expressed what is wrong with the hero characters in a way that I was having trouble nailing down.  They are all angelically noble (this is the same problem I have had with some of Dickens's characters) and therefore respond to stress in the same way, which makes their constant worry get annoying even though it is well founded. Van Helsing especially seems to spend half his time mawkishly telling Mina how wonderful she is whenever she is worried about turning into a blood sucking vampire. I guess this relates to the various sexual subtexts that have been suggested for the novel, but I found this side of it harder to relate to. 

The epistolary format is another thing that I wasn't sure about. It works some of the time but I don't know why the whole bulk of the novel requires it. Often a character will say something like, ""What a long, tiring and dangerous day! And more tomorrow! Let me spend a few hours writing it all down in detail before I get some rest...""

The climax was also a little disappointing. [***spoilers coming***] The heroes have to race across Europe to beat Dracula to his castle. Dracula spends the time asleep in his box. They manage to catch and destroy him just in time. This final confrontation is only a couple of pages, so the real battle was not so much against Dracula but against the train and shipping timetables.

This all makes me sound like I hate the novel, which I don't.

The heroic exploits of Van Helsing, Quincy, and Dr. Stewart throughout the ordeal had me cheering their goodness and bravery.  

Renfield was a revolting creature that reminded us what would become of the world if evil creatures like Dracula were allowed to torment the innocent unabated.

Dracula feeding children to his harem of she demons and vampiric Lucy bringing a child back to her crypt set the tone of the novel and shows us that these creatures aren't human and don't deserve any of our sympathies. 

To me, if you allow your mind to wonder into the realm where such creatures can exist, the book is the scariest that I've ever read.

See Polidori's 'The Vampyre,' which was the actual progenitor of the genre, and popular enough in its day to inspire not one but several operatic adaptations, and a work that Stoker was definitely responding to / ripping off. If memory serves, 'Carmilla' and the hilariously titled 'Varney the Vampyre' also predated 'Dracula' by a good deal. Not to mention the story of anonymous authorship called 'The Mysterious Stranger,' which I can't believe Stoker hadn't read, because its opening is practically beat for beat the very same as an opening incident in 'Dracula.' The story begins with a carriage, chased along a treacherous mountain pass by ravenous wolves.  A sexy vampire saves our heroes by commanding the wolves depart with a wave of his arm.

Sure it might have included some stereotypes on women according to the time it was written. But I find Stoker's writing to have been purely genius and even daring to the Victorian era's mindsets. 
Lucy's character was clearly the antonym of the ideal Victorian woman. She was a bold and curious girl and she was even described in erotical ways in some parts of the book. Instead of appearing as a child caregiver, once turned into a vampire, she preys on children! That kinda destroys the old fashioned idea that women should be so attentive to children and constantly look out for them. As creepy as it sounds, and yet it's an amazing idea...
Mina was a heroine, at last in my point of view. She was very clever and played a major part in Dracula's demise. She clearly helped the men build their plan to take him down. Even Van Helsing admits, at some point, that they probably would never have succeeded to catch Dracula if it wasn't for Mina's intelligent planning.

q9eww4_7,q9eww4,"Yea, there was actually a conception of the New Woman at this time as a part of early feminism. Mina at once both embodies and criticizes this concept, but criticizes it positively, saying that the New Woman should be even more capable and have more agency. There’s one line where Lucy and Mina say the New Woman would be appalled at how much they ate for lunch one day. And that “trained like a man” line OP quotes serves to show that women are equal to men, only excluded from the opportunities to demonstrate it.

Similarly, the “foreigner” reading OP gives is also a criticism of Britain. A lot of horror at this time was the progressive voice trying to come to grips with what so called civilized Europe was doing to the world. To answer OP’s question about whether this book is only famous for establishing vampire lore, it isn’t. It’s a criticism of the Age of Reason/The Age of Science. The Western Worldview is predicated on rationality and recording things, but Dracula foils all that. When Harker sets out on his journey he goes to the British Museum to see what’s on record and looks at Maps but can’t find Dracula’s castle anywhere, it seems to exist between 3 territories but isn’t actually plotted. This is like Dracula’s being the living dead. He blurs the line of categorization and as such poses an existential threat to the West which depends on this to navigate the world. It’s also why the color gray is a huge theme in the book. Seward refers to God as the Great Recorder who will look at his ledger and see if it is to profit or loss. Aka God is like a purely rational scientist and salvation is thought of in economic terms. When your worldview is based solely on rationality and profits=salvation you will be capable of some heinous shit.

I also hardly think any of the characters in the novel are 'enlightened' except for Professor Van Helsing and he is not superstitious. If you were to encounter a walking-talking vampire with hypnotic powers who can make wolves do his bidding, and can scale walls like a lizard, I'd hardly need a reason to be superstitious about it since I'd be seeing it with my own two eyes. In fact, I couldn't be superstitious about anything really since I would sensibly understand that there are such things as vampires, as Professor Van Helsing is aware of them and that they actually exist in the world of the novel.

Also, don't forget, these middle-class, intellectuals, products of really a Victorian rather than a strictly Enlightenment age, eventually went off to fight one another in the first major World War in history less than 20 years after Dracula was written.

odc5ou_6,odc5ou,">Like Dracula the character is an allegorization of anything and everything that has to do with feudalism?

Of course he is. He is a Count. He literally is feudalism in the flesh. He has underlings do his bidding, whether by force or magic. Something that would have been obsolete in 19th century Western Europe.

*Here (in Transylvania) I am noble; I am boyar; the common people know me, and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land (England), he is no one; men know him not—and to know not is to care not for.*

This line says it all - Dracula's about to leave his own fief, his kingdom where everyone has learned to fear him and his ilk for centuries, and about to embark on a journey to England, where he will be treated like anyone else, and where he no longer has power and control.

>Feudalism ended in the 1400s. Seems a bit odd that such a concern would have occurred to Bram Stoker in 1897.

But that's the point. Dracula *lived* in the 1400s and is still used to living that way even into the 19th century, because the novel tries to make it clear that Transylvania hardly changes. 

>I also hardly think any of the characters in the novel are 'enlightened' except for Professor Van Helsing and he is not superstitious.

odc5ou_9,odc5ou,">You misunderstand. Superstition is a belief in something not based on one’s reason or knowledge. In the world of the novel, vampires obviously exist and Van Helsing knows that and has prior experience of that so it is impossible for him to be superstitious of vampires since he would in fact possess prior knowledge of vampires and well the fact that the novel is about a vampire. 

Van Helsing does *not* have experience with vampires prior to meeting Dracula as far as I can recall. This makes his belief in vampires a ""superstition"". He has never encountered vampires before; merely heard of them, what they are reputed to do, and the means to destroy them.

>Feudalism existing in small patches in remote areas of Europe is not enough to convince me that Stoker would have been more concerned or interested in feudalism than he would have been in industrialism, capitalism or Marxism. I find it a big stretch that Stoker would have cared about these topics at all in writing the book.

I mean it's my analysis, not his. We will never be completely certain what Stoker himself had in mind while writing the book, we can only surmise. Nevertheless, there are some passages that refer to this dichotomy of the old, feudal world of Dracula and the modern, industrial world of Harker and the team.

For instance, we observe Dracula's initial anxiety about moving to the bustling cities of England, away from his kingdom where he held sway for centuries:

>Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not enough for me.  **Here I am noble; I am boyar; the common people know me, and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not—and to know not is to care not for.** I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’ I have been so long master that I would be master still—or at least that none other should be master of me.

Then, Harker on later states his fears that, despite being technologically and culturally ""advanced"", contemporary England may not be invincible to the unknown powers that be:

>It is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere “modernity” cannot kill.

All in all, I think it is possible that Stoker did have some commentaries going on while writing it, but it was either only subconscious or secondary to the main point; the undead. In the end, I think it is still, like Godzilla, King Kong, or Call of Cthulhu, a cheesy monster story, and any analyses we try to conjure up of a presupposed deeper meaning behind the text are just theories.",virgin693838281,2021-07-06T00:50:12Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,9

But yeah, his seemingly incestous polyamory was definitely at odds with Victorian norms and was certainly used to heighten the exotic and grotesque aspects of the character.

It's fitting how the Count, a feudal warlord sorcerer used to seeing other people as lesser than and subservient to him, eventually realises this won't fly in a contemporary society that has adapted a more democratic system. People have learned to think critically, and question authority, and after they rekindle the relevance of ""old superstition"", are fully equipped to deal with him.

I definitely sympathize with your frustration over the characters though.  They tend to make silly judgments, overlook important information, and are often *very* wrong about things they pretend to know a lot about.  Especially with Van Helsing.  When he first showed up, I thought of him as a funny little polite and educated foreign man.  But so much of what he said, even beyond his dreadful grasp of English grammar, made very little sense.  He claims to be a doctor, but his medicinal knowledge is often wrong and borders on malpractice (I mean, really, using *three* different blood donors, rolling the dice each time that the new donor won't have a blood type that will be rejected.)  He claims to be a Catholic, but he commits sacrilege by  profaning the Eucharist by crumbling it on the ground, drawing protective circles with it, even *mashing it up* into a paste to seal Lucy's crypt.  Seems fishy.

But I think the success of Dracula is in it's presentation.  It is presented not as a novel, not as a legend, not as fiction at all.  It makes no promises, it just gives you what's there--an eerie manuscript compiled by a ragtag band of folks facing something they don't understand.  So while I agree that they often just blunder about and screw up repeatedly, I think it lends some credence to that atmosphere of discovery--not just their discovery, but yours as the reader.  You are as entitled to interpret the manuscript as the characters are when they made it.  So if you realize something before they do, it pulls you in, makes you part of it, adds that infuriating level of irony.

29g92f_21,29g92f,"lol three months late, but currently doing a reread and looking for discussion on Reddit. It wasn't the first time -- he'd been drinking her blood for the past night or two.

Basically, Dracula is using the group's silence, and intention to protect Mina, against them. Remember: the men, being manly men who wouldn't burden a woman with the knowledge, have not spoken to her about their plans or anything they've learned over the past couple of days. They have decided that she must be left out of this for her own good. It's the ""separate spheres"" ideal of the Victorian family (men and women live in different worlds, the man protects the woman and the woman comforts the man) taken to an extreme, and Dracula is using that ideal against them. Mina was completely aware of the entire story up until now. She was the one who transcribed and put together all the documentation they've got. She's the one who helped everybody make sense of their individual stories by putting them together. But she was also a woman, which, according to the Victorian sensibilities, meant that she was delicate and must be protected. So none of them will talk to her about their plans and what they've learned, and she assumes that her strange dreams about red eyes and sentient mist are just her own emotions running wild (because that's what, in Victorian ideas about gender, ladies do: have wild, uncontrollable emotions).

At the same time, Dracula was hypnotizing Renfield -- in Seward's notes, he mentions that twice, Renfield is unable to even say the word ""drink"" with regard to consuming life. From Mina's journal entries, her memory is fuzzy -- she assumes it's just that all the stories about ""red eyes"" and her concern over her husband's safety are making her see the candle flame as a pair of red eyes -- and Dracula hypnotizes her to prevent her from being able to say anything. Later, Mina is unable to talk about certain aspects of the ordeal at all except for a few minutes each day, at sunrise and sunset. Dracula has hypnotized her, and prevented her from talking to them and just telling them what's going on and what needs to be done to fix it.

It's partly horror, but it's also comedy of errors. Dracula is using the Victorian mores against them: those mores dictate that they make sure Mina is coddled and protected and completely cut off from any knowledge of what they're doing, and Dracula uses the fact that they're paying no attention whatsoever to Mina as a way to disrupt their plans.",lesspoppedthanever,2014-10-10T19:06:39Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,21

That's what I took from it too after reading it. I think part of it is that Dracula's been done to death for over a century, so even if you've never read the books, you know who/what it's about and what you're in for. I think, too, is the fact that horror has also changed a lot in the last century and so something that an Victorian reader might find scary just comes off as cheesy. 

I do think it's a great book and what you say is considered one of the reasons it's lasted so long while so many other books of its type have been forgotten: it's a fascinating window into the fears and concerns of Victorian readers: aristocracy vs democracy, superstition vs rationality, the rise of technology, women's rights, class relations, etc. ",marisachan,2018-02-05T17:19:30Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,10

Jonathan Harker's diary at the beginning kept me from putting the book down.
But in the second half, it gets really redundant and seems to slow down, and I feel the framing device turns against itself. Now that all the characters are intentionally writing diaries for the purpose of tracking Dracula, theres an awful lot of explaining when they are finding time to write and stating over and over that they will update the group with all the info.

Mina was burned by the holy wafer because she was tainted by Dracula.

I find Dracula suffers from the problem OP says of description becoming repetitious but that's not true of Heart of Darkness where the jungle changes as they tread the river.

 I think Conrad's writing is so much better that's an unfair comparison.  Also not the same kind of story.  Unlike Dracula, which really is about the plot, Heart of Darkness is about the structure and journey.  The strength of Dracula OP mentions absolutely does not exist in Heart of Darkness.  If you're reading Conrad for plot, you're in for a disappointment for sure.  

Last of the Mohicans, though, is a good comparison. That's a great plot wrapped into a tedious book.  Probably better than Dracula in plot but more tedious in how it's written.

Been a long time since B.S's Dracula, but wasn't Dracula's plan, according to Harker, to bring him to the castle to get business done and the signed papers taken back to London by Harker to get the Count set up in ""proper"" society?  The plan was altered by Dracula to allow him to become more acquainted with proper London customs and language. He is a proper predator, after all, and 'foreigners' or 'weirdos' are the first to be suspected when people die oddly.

However, as I was reading I kept imaging someone reading the book a century earlier by candle/lamplight and imagined that it would be particularly scary for them.

I read the excellent Oxford World Classics edition of the novel, the annotations for which does a great job of highlighting the cultural context at the time which would have made the novel so frightening for a reader back then.

This sense of fear would have been shaped by the lesser understanding of science back in that century and the greater belief placed in organised religion and the supernatural. 

There is also an often cited view that the novel also plays into that sense of unknown about the rest of the world, even simply mainland Europe which to many people in the UK and Ireland would have been a relatively unknown and mysterious place at the time, shrouded in myths. If we think of Dracula as a foreign enemy, arriving by boat to strike fear into the heart of London.

An example which really stood out for me were the blood-transfusion scenes, in which Van Helsing and some of the other characters attempted to revive victims of Dracula. The annotated version explained that this was a relatively radical and dangerous medical procedure at the time, which would have injected an even greater sense of danger to those scenes.

Carmilla is Laura's friend, even though she ends up being dangerous, and Laura doesn't really want her to be defeated. Dracula is framed as a monster to be defeated more than a character who is beloved in some ways and dangerous in others. *Dracula* kind of created the vampire as we think of it today, whereas Carmilla's vampirism is sort of vaguely discussed, and the Van Helsing character shows up at the very end rather than being a part of the big hunt for the bad guy.

I really like both *Carmilla* and *Dracula* and I think in a lot of ways *Carmilla* is more interesting than *Dracula*, but *Dracula* is kind of a kickass story about a bunch of friends teaming up to defeat a monster and that's something that has a lot of potential for widespread success (and a ton of adaptations).",sybil_vain,2021-04-22T21:08:06Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,3
mw79eg_4,mw79eg,"I recently actually read through the book. I think part of the reason is...Carmilla doesn't really feel like a threatening villain all things said. At least, not to me in my modern day senses. She's repeatedly described as languid, cowardly and shows no real outward malice (actually seeming quite fond of the main character and we're told through dialogue she's evil and manipulative rather than actions). The only thing that I feel she really had that would have been *seen* as villainous is she really didn't seem to like religion and ranted about it. When the truth of her ability is revealed, it's through a story of what happened to someone else we've never met, in which we immediately transition to confrontation and defeating Carmilla (which happens fairly easily). Simply put, Carmilla didn't have the stage presence that Dracula ended up having.

There's also the political issues. The main character and villain are....very lesbian. And the book is clearly trying to present that as a bad thing, it's very present throughout and I can see how in 1872, a lot of people would turn their nose up at it.

8gkm0a_2,8gkm0a,"I read the book a few years ago and was not that impressed. A friend had suggested it to me saying how scary it was but I mostly found it dull.

Take my opinions with a grain of salt because I have very little training in how to analyse books and only really started getting interested in classical stories about 4 years ago, so I'm not a pro at dissecting them or anything.

I, like you, enjoyed the part at the beginning in Dracula's castle. 

I also liked (if I remember correctly) the parts where it focuses on the mental patient that was obsessed with Dracula but other than that I found it a chore to get through.

One thing in particular that really pissed me off was how long the author would sometimes take to describe something of very little importance to the overall story. I think I remember almost a whole page or more dedicated to describing a door, not a special door with lots of relevance to the plot but just a fucking door. 

Sometimes it gave me the impression that the author just liked to show off how well he could describe things, the writing equivalent to 'loving the way he sounds' so to speak.

One thing positive I can say about the book is that it definitely surprised me a lot. A lot of my information about Dracula had come from other forms of media (film, TV etc) and it's quite bizarre how wrong they get the character and Van Helsing for that matter. I'm pretty sure I remember Dracula being described as having a long grey moustache in the book and yet you rarely see him being depicted with one in other forms of media. It was also quite the surprise that the whole book (or even the majority) did not take place in Transylvania.

Id probably only suggest the book to massive fans of Dracula as he appears in other forms of media, just so they could compare him to the original. ",sandervich,2018-05-02T21:46:09Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,2
8gkm0a_3,8gkm0a,"I personally liked Dracula, but I just see it as a neat horror story. Not amazing or anything, but it was engaging and entertaining to me.

I'd like to comment I didn't think the ending was predictable. For the most part after [Spoiler](#Dracula left England I was in doubt whether they would succeed in stopping him or if Mina wouldn't flip. Eventually these doubts dissolved, earlier than I'd have liked I must say, but I wouldn't call it predictable.)

Another thing that struck me about the ending is [Spoiler](#Quincey's death. It didn't feel sad or good or anything, it just felt really odd. My guess is because we never got much insight into his character or foreshadowing that he would die. I'm not sure how that could be done, but if, say, Mina did flip in the end, I think it would at the very least not have felt so strange. It wouldn't be a token death like Quincey's.)

You're not wrong about the importance of religion to the novel. Importantly, it's specifically *Catholicism* that's important to the novel.

These are things that have less significance in Protestantism than in Catholicism, and it's not any of the (presumably Anglican) Englishmen who introduces their use against Dracula. It's a Romanian peasant who gives Harker a crucifix that protects him in Dracula's castle, and the rest is (Dutch) Van Helsing.

But it was Halloween season this year and I like Dracula the icon/character, so started reading it in my downtime on my work computer.

&#x200B;

I agree with pretty much everything you said, bar the last sequence, which I'm just getting to. Jonathan in Dracula's castle is great, easily the best thing about the book so far.

&#x200B;

There have been things I liked since then (Renfield is pretty interesting, if a bit repetitive, too), but the middle section is definitely a repetitive, tedious mess overall. So much of characters unnecessarily fawning over each other, Van Helsing draws everything leading up to Vampire Lucy's death out sooooooo long, etc. 

&#x200B;

It does rub me a bit weirdly how Christian it is. Not even so much because of their fears of dying unholy vampires, but just in the inherent fact that Dracula is so staggeringly weak against any religious object and the frequent (especially as the book goes on) calls to God for mercy, deliverance, etc. Of course, once it's established that vampires are weak against religious artifacts it basically establishes that the Dracula world has a Christian God, so fearing dying an unholy vampire starts to seem a scarier prospect. ",Whiskeycloned,2018-12-06T15:58:57Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,9
a3fq6d_10,a3fq6d,"I agree that the Christianity in Dracula took some adjusting too. Maldevinine (previous comment) is right, that it would have been central to the life of the everybody reading novels at the time. One of the ideas that I find really interesting to consider when reading Dracula is that his very existence is a blasphemy. Blasphemy, to me as a modern athiest, has been a very difficult concept to grasp. Having insight into the horror and offence of blasphemy within this book was illuminating more broadly. It reminds me in some way of the controversy around Salman Rushdies' 'Satanic Verses'. The pain felt by so many in the Muslim community in reaction to that book (which was published in 1988, and was reacted with violence and Rushdie was issued a fatwa) is that it is blasphemous. This is like a religious crime, where the sacred is not just insulted, but violated. The fact that Dracula has come into being at all is an afront to God and therefore all of life, which is the real terror aspect of his monster status. The blood drinking and killing is vile, but the blasphemy of his existence is terrifying. It definitely requires quite a high level of suspending disbelief reading it as I have never had spirituality of any kind in my life. But religions, and blasphemies against them, still spark wars. Anthropomorphism it into one monster is easier to understand? Or at least digest. (There's a blood sucking joke in there and I can't get it.)  


I agree as well, that the opening chapters of the book with Harker's stay at the castle are magnificent. I read all the way to the end because of the quality of that writing. Although, I hated the way Stoker made the very slow corruption of Lucy drag on and on including multiple POV's of the same events. It does make it feel longwinded, and then the end is much less climactic because of this? I despise the sexism surrounding Mina's character, and Lucy. Although I managed it because of the publication date. (To be honest, Mina is almost identical to modern ""strong female characters"" written today, but that's a whole essay right there?)  


And I have to say, I really enjoyed the way Stoker collected the writings of many people to piece together the story. I listened to it on Audio book, with many actors creating the voices of each POV. I imagine this made it easier going, and I've never managed to get to the end of the text in print. I really, really, loved the Ships log. It's a good, scary bit of horror. When the ship wrecks and that guys strapped to the wheel, and there's nobody left alive on board it's truly horrifying. I think this was emphasised by the fact it felt like a piece of evidence that had just been uncovered.  


One thing I struggled with MASSIVELY was why in hell is Dracula trying to get to England? I must have fallen asleep during a chapter, (audio book) but I would really have cared a lot more about Dracula's terrible quest to claim Lucy? Why did Dracula need Harker? Why was he moving to Whitby? All the fiddling about with tons of earth on the ship and hiding them in an old house would have mattered more if I knew what he was trying to achieve?

Well, right now most of the literature about vampires tend to portray them in a much different manner... in a romantic manner, even (see Anne Rice, Vampire: The Masquerade, the Underworld series, Twi...gah, you know what I mean). As we lose faith in an afterlife, the thought of becoming an eternal ""living dead"" seems to have lost a lot of its dread and to have become a conduit for people's fantasies about vanquishing aging and death. It seems to me the few Vampire movies and stories that portray them as things to fear in recent years tend to rely on gore and the good old fear of death, making vampires a monster like a savage animal more than something that inspires spiritual dread.

a3fq6d_16,a3fq6d,"*Dracula* **is** full of homoerotic subtext though. It’s undeniably there. 

• Dracula’s assault of women is undeniably sexual, but he also desires to bite men (specifically Jonathan) in similar ways. 

• He tells the female vampires in his castle multiple times that Jonathan belongs to him, and is all his for the first night before they can get in on the action - he’s not going to kill Jonathan, he must be sexually assaulting him.

• Dracula literally looks at Jonathan and says ‘Yes, I too can love’

• Jonathan observes Dracula sleeping, and touches his sleeping body while using words associated with phalluses like ‘swollen’ ‘bloated’ etc.

• vampire’s teeth, hunter’s stakes etc. are all phallic imagery

• Stoker supposedly based the character of Dracula on Oscar Wilde, whose trial for homosexuality was a huge deal shortly before the novel was written. Wilde and Stoker both came from Dublin, and Stoker even stole Wilde’s first girlfriend!


**Dracula isn’t gay, because he’s not a real person. He represents (in part) the danger of sexuality that are faced by women as well as men, and as such is a shape-shifting bisexual demon from a time of great sexual repression and rampant spreading of disease due to rising prostitution, which Stoker himself partook in and died of.**

But it also includes other aspects of sexuality like promiscuity, polyamory and incest.

Unless you have a letter of Bram Stoker expressly stating that, you cannot claim that it's objectively ""about"" sexuality.

About Victorian upper-class people who are skeptical of mythology and the supernatural (though religious) coming face to face with a monster straight out of mythology, having to embrace old superstitions and band together to defend then modern society from the curse of a monster from another era.

If you read something else into it, fine, but understand that this might be meaning you inject into the work and not meaning you extract out of it, and as such may say more about you than it does about the work you're analyzing. This reminds me of the case in the 80s when Tipper Gore (Al Gore's wife) was accusing the Twisted Sister song ""Under the blade"" of being about and promoting self-cutting, bondage and rape. In a famous testimony before a Senate committee, a member of Twisted Sister testified that the song was not about self-cutting, but about surgery and the fear of letting surgeons cut into you. As he pointed out ""*The lyrics she quoted have absolutely nothing to do with these topics. On the contrary, the words in question are about surgery and the fear that it instills in people. … I can say categorically that the only sadomasochism, bondage and rape in this song is in the mind of Ms. Gore.*""

At the time I was most interested in it because it featured Geneviève Dieudonné, finally decorated with the accents her name lacked in all of her appearances in Newman's fiction for Games Workshop, but when the Titan Books editions of the novels came out recently, I avidly devoured *Anno* and *The Bloody Red Baron*. Like yourself, I found *Dracula Cha-Cha-Cha* less engaging, though I did enjoy the Bond references and the Superman connection.

*Johnny Alucard*... is a bit of a mess, honestly. It's not properly a novel and it's really a collection of short stories that Newman's edited together with more linking material. While it's fun to revisit Geneviève and spot some more 80s/90s cultural references - Newman's text is never not going to be fun as an exercise in ""Did You Spot?"" - the story isn't quite as good as the first two. 

You can certainly feel Newman's passion for film and literary trivia, but I feel that he seems more invested in the Victorian/Georgian periods of *Anno Dracula* and *The Bloody Red Baron* than in the later timezones.

Furthermore, this in turn could be read as the constant fear and refusal to question which can happen in such devout societies (never questioning just accept belief full stop), while a society that questions and pushes forward (Doctor, Lawyer, Professor etc.) is the society which will conquer the 'demons in the night' and the fear of the unknown - it's the society that will be able to answer questions and solve problems for the better.",jsdeerwood,2012-07-20T21:56:16Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,2

This posthumously published story has recently become the focus of much debate as to whether it is worthy of being considered authoritative due to minor quibbles with its continuity to the novel. Of course, there are also many Stoker fans who will argue when the novel is actually set because of similar inconsistencies. It provides no small amusement that people will argue over these points while reading a book about a vampire in Nineteenth Century London. Nevertheless, the inclusion of the story and in it’s proper place before the novel sets this edition apart from nearly every other version that pairs the two together.""",Wo3lf,2015-09-29T19:26:49Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,1

4yemss_3,4yemss,"I actually took an elective class in college on Vampire mythology, and we spent a good two or three weeks just on Dracula. From what I recall (and it's been several years), Dracula was kind of the first horror novel that inspired readers to ""route for the bad guy"", even thought that was not at all Bram Stokers intention and it was some years before that really evolved into the fully romantic Gary Oldman type Dracula we get today. 

People like Dracula. He doesn't kill his victims (not always anyway). Instead he brings them into his world where you never age, you never get sick, you never die so long as you stay away from Van Helsing, and the suffocatingly conservative values of Victorian society don't really apply to you anymore. Obviously that's going to strike a chord with some people and they're going to start thinking ""maybe Dracula isn't so bad"" and ""maybe VanHelsing should just mind his own buisness"". And that's how we start getting the increasingly charming and charismatic Draculas that we have now. 

Arguably all modern vampire books/movies in the West owe their existence, in part, to Dracula. Even your Twilight vampires that sparkle in the sun and only drink ethically sourced deer blood have more in common with Dracula than they do any vampire story that came before.

9l4dnt_1,9l4dnt,"*Dracula* is roughly as real as *The Da Vinci Code*. Yeah, there really was a guy named Dracula (or something that could be Anglicized like that), and the book really does reflect his reputation in popular history but that was partly due to politics between then and now and the real story is more complicated... and that's about as far as the similarities go.

This article makes it look like *Dracula* was censored to cover up the fact that it was true, but the editor's rejection probably had a lot more to do with the fact that Jack the Ripper was active less than 10 years earlier. I'm pretty sure no serious historian entertains the idea that Jack the Ripper was actually a vampire. The article makes it look like the Dmitri's cargo of ""crates of earth"" was mysterious. I don't know much about sailing ships, but I believe they often use something called ""ballast.""

I thought that *Dracula: the Un-Dead*, co-authored by Dacre Stoker (Bram's great-grandnephew) was OK as fan fiction goes. It ""retcons"" important parts of the original novel to be more consistent with the Hollywood version (burning in the sun, mainly), and makes several other changes that just weren't there in the original.

1ln0lh_2,1ln0lh,"The following is my personal take on an established genre and not meant to be a published thesis or anything. It's just recounting bits and pieces of what I've picked up reading about the history and contemporary reception of some of my favourite books.

Well, when Dracula first came out in 1897 it wasn't the cultural phenomenon that it is now known to be. It received praise from critics but wasn't a widespread success in terms of notoriety or sales. The massive popularity came later after the film versions of the story were released (most notably 1922's silent film *Nosferatu*). Dracula is a novel combining previous vampire stories and lore and is part of a longer history of a particular genre. 

The Gothic Fiction or Gothic Horror genre had been around for awhile and most scholars agree that it began with the novel *The Castle of Otranto* by Horace Walpole in 1764. 

Ann Radcliffe was another author who had a huge influence on the genre. She published a number of Gothic novels in the 1790s and really solidified the genre. In her time her novels were widely read but there was still a stigma around the genre. Very little is known about her actual life and when she was alive rumours abounded about her sanity (likely not true). Sort of like how mainstream media sometimes likes to paint Stephen King as a creepy guy (at least back when he was beginning to garner fame).  

There was a large debate going on about the affect that reading these types of novels had on society. Particularly the influence that they had on young impressionable women (presumably the largest audience for these novels in the eyes of the literary critics, although they were read by pretty much everyone). 

All you have to do is look at *Northanger Abbey*, published 1817, to see how important these issues were to society at the time and how seriously the concerns voiced by those professing morality (such as literary critics and religious ) were taken even decades after. It is a novel written by Jane Austen parodying Ann Radcliffe's novels, the Gothic genre and the way it influences younger women (Austen was a fan of Radcliffe's writing so her novel is more poking gentle fun and raising relevant questions than outright condemning it).        

I read somewhere that when *The Monk* by Matthew Gregory Lewis was published in 1796, people (librarians, older family members) would go through the book and cross out any passages that they deemed to be offensive in order to protect the impressionable youth who may stumble upon it.

The backlash against these novels is actually incredibly similar to the arguments brought against violent videogames or graphic movies today. People argued that when you read these types of terrifying novels you would get a rush, and eventually you would need larger and larger doses to get that rush, so that eventually readers would pursue these horrors in real life. There was a real concern about how these texts would affect the very moral fiber of society.

That is also where you get so many of these worn-out tropes. They originated in these first novels. The ""found text"" that was ""translated"" from another language and describing events that occurred in foreign (outside of England) lands. These novels were so frightening to contemporary readers that to really enjoy the terrifying events taking place in the Gothic novels the author had to place the reader a safe distance away from their audience. 

Still, a lot of these authors, such as Matthew Lewis were denounced as being sick, twisted lunatics. The genre was aligned with radical thinking and behaviour. These early novels came out during the same time period as the political upheaval in France and the execution of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and numerous aristocrats. It was a very politically charged time.

Reading was also somewhat of a social pastime. Everyone would gather around and read novels aloud to one another. It was oratory rather than individual. Printing books at this time was a costly expense so one copy was often passed around and shared.  

I'm not going to profess to be an expert in historical technology and lighting but people were not necessarily connected in the myriad of ways that technology enables us to be in modern society. It was darker outside at night, homes in a lot of places were far more isolated. News and transportation traveled much slower and were not as reliable.

There was also a lot more superstition and lore infused into everyday life. At the beginning of the Victorian period you have alchemists and at the end of it you have scientists. There was a huge amount of social, cultural and scientific change and progress during this time.       

By the time the Victorian period rolls around and Dracula is published, Gothic fiction has become an established literary genre. However the fears that it explores are tailored to the current social and political climate. The rise of technology and the fears it brings along with it, Darwinism, the corruption of society, xenophobia, the ""Modern Woman"" (linked to the women's rights movement), all familiar themes that have been explored in relation to Dracula before by literary scholars.

Personally, I think it would be awesome to go back in time and experience what it would be like to read Dracula in the time it was written - or any other Gothic novel. Readers back then had a completely different relationship to the text because it was often a *shared* experience. Imagine reading aloud a particularly horrifying passage - you are introduced to and experiencing the fear of this scene at the same time as those around you. Similar to watching a horror movie and feeling your own fear rising as your friends' terror begins to influence your own state of mind.

As **LadyLark** said before, I think sitting in a darkened room lit only by candles or a flickering fire and reading these stories aloud among a small gathering of friends and family would make the stories seem far realer and so much closer to home. 

I hope I shared some interesting information. It's just my own thoughts on what people may have felt/thought when these types of books were first published. I'm not professing to be an expert.            ",VendingMachineKitten,2013-09-03T23:24:56Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,2

It is scarier on a more basic level than cheap scares because it is more lasting.  It's an idea that gets under your skin and stays with you, essentially haunting you.  That's a real haunting, not what's offered to us in theaters today.  Shelley got that.  Poe got that.  Stoker got that.  

An example that I always use when I try to explain this to people is from Frankenstein.  Spoilers! if you have not read it.  Think back to when Victor Frankenstein explains and describes in pretty great detail over and over how he was raised from childhood with Elizabeth as brother and sister.  She IS his sister, albeit adopted.  They grow up and it is accepted that they will marry; a betrothal of sorts.  After the monster feels betrayed by what is essentially his maker and father, he explicitly tells Victor that ""he will be with him on his wedding night.""  Then, after knowing this and being reminded of it again by the monster, instead of doing something about it or warning Elizabeth, he tells her that he has something important to discuss with her THE NIGHT AFTER THE WEDDING.  The night AFTER he KNOWS the monster is going to do something.  All of this has to stem from something either consciously or subconsciously because he does not want to go thorough with the wedding.  Why?  Well what happens on the wedding night?  Consummation of the wedding.  Everyone reading this who has a sibling, do one thing for me right now: real quick, close your eyes and imagine you and your sibling having sex.  Couldn't do it, could you?  BECAUSE THAT IS HORROR.

I would argue that novels like these are still absolutely horrific to contemporary writers and readers and filmmakers and everything, because the ideas are still basically horrifying, it's just a matter of attention spans.  I think people are so used to shock value that they might be bored by these authors, which is a shame.",IAmSherLocked12,2013-09-03T22:44:45Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,8
1ln0lh_9,1ln0lh,"I agree with this. Reading Dracula (or any horror story for that matter) in the middle of a city on an e-reader in 2013 is obviously not going to be scary.

Rewind to 1900, you live on a farm out of sight of any other houses, you have heard almost nothing about vampires before and obviously know nothing about the story itself. You are reading it at night, with no background television or lights outside. Throw in the fact that it is 1900 and you are probably a little bit superstitious and the idea of a demonic force at work is not something laughable to you and it would be scary.

2y56kz_1,2y56kz,"I took a Horror film and fiction class once, and these two works were at the heart of the content, as most horror genres, in both mediums, focus on some type of aspect of vampirism or monstrosity. The Victorian Era especially gave rise to the very real fear of the ""animal"" or ""vampire"" or ""monster"" within. Works like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Jane Eyre, and even Barie's Peter Pan saw the cultures near obsession with this concept.  This ties into animal studies as well. So many connections to be drawn from the fears that non-humans and human animals are related. Very cool stuff. I would also add Waller's The Living and the Undead and Brode's collection of compilation of essays and critiques called ""Dracula's Daughters"". ",,2015-03-06T17:15:23Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Dracula,1
