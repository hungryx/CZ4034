yihi9n_1,yihi9n,Heart of Darkness is in the same league as Animal Farm as being a very political novel for its time.

yihi9n_2,yihi9n,"Conrad is one of my favorite authors. *Heart of Darkness* was the first book I read of his, and it is dear to me for that and other reasons, but I do confess I enjoyed his *Lord Jim* far more. There are some connective themes, but LJ is far superior in my opinion, and hailed as a masterpiece by many.",Onomatopoeia_Utopia,2022-11-01T00:37:12Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,2
yihi9n_3,yihi9n,"It's an interesting perspective at the very least. Joseph Conrad traveled around the world in the merchant marine and saw what came from the British Empire and colonialism in general. He didn't consider Heart of Darkness to be all that important when he wrote it, and it didn't get much attention when it was published either. I believe it was included in an aggregation of short stories. Experts on colonialism dispute how he portrays native Africans and find it to be xenophobic. 

Honestly, Apocalypse Now has probably added to people thinking it's a cornerstone of the literary world that everyone should read. That's my own personal opinion.",Shtune,2022-10-31T19:25:12Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,3

That's what I marvel at. He went to sea at age 11 and learned English from British sailors but his use of imagery and metaphor are stunning.

y1u4b5_1,y1u4b5,"If you loved Heart Of Darkness, definitely read Things Fall Apart by China Achebe. Achebe hated Heart of Darkness, as Africans were only ever portrayed as other, so he wrote a story that showed Africans as being fully-conscious people with agency. 
I’ve never been able to dislike HOD, it’s too beautiful, but Achebe’s criticism is pretty valid. 
More importantly, Things Fall Apart is itself a beautiful read.

hh6dxg_3,hh6dxg,"It's one of those works we have to approach without expecting storytelling. It's almost poetry presented in prose form. Much like Camus, Conrad was presenting musings on certain themes but instead of jotting notes to/for himself he threw it into a setting. Admittedly Camus took readers' interest quite a bit more seriously but I've always had the impression both people needed to write for the same reasons.

People who finally try Moby Dick are up against the same obstacle- we're all told it's THE great novel by the educated, it's about a nutjob ship's captain's obsession with a murderous whale by those who only know the fame of the title. When someone actually reads it they find it disappointing or realise it's a beautifully composed glimpse at various types of friendship, the positives and negatives of being thrown together in a strictly contained mini-society and insights into trades that have disappeared from modern life.

Try approaching Heart of Darkness like many SF fans pick their books--there's not a whole lot of science usually, the stories are mostly about people. And, much like HoD there's only so much room(pages?) to explore the vagaries of the human condition.",otherpaul2,2020-06-28T17:13:17Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,3

178w0rq_1,178w0rq,"Your list is pretty thorough.  Re: *Apocalypse Now* used *Heart of Darkness* as a loose general guide, in the late 1960s but it was merged with separate Vietnam War stories also compiled by Milius, the first writer.  Plus adapting some quotes from the Arab-Isreal Six-Day war and just plain thinking things up.  Also much came from newspaper clippings covering Vietnam War personalities and events which were aggregated. 

Then when Coppola bought the rights and rewrote it, as a **second writer** he added elements of Dante’s *Inferno* to go with the boat ride after the Air Cav assault.   Also Coppola brought in Micheal Herr, a longtime combat correspondent in the Vietnam War, as a **third writer**.

l85yvw_1,l85yvw,"Yes, Conrad is typically considered critical of colonialism and imperialism. Also, yes, Chinua Achebe has a rather (in)famous interpretation of Conrad’s HoD that suggests the text represents Africans as savages and Africa as uncivilized. 

That said, Patrick Bratlinger has a book titled Rule of Darkness that traces colonialism in Victorian literature. At the end of Bratlinger’s book, he challenges Achebe’s reading of HoD and argues that Conrad isn’t really calling Africans or Africa savage. Instead, Kurtz’s insanity that comes upon him in the “heart of darkness” reveals his own colonial “heart of darkness” (read heart of evil), and the spirit of imperialism (ivory trading) is what brings about his madness. So, what Bratlinger wants us to reconsider is the civilized/savagery dichotomy. Where the native is typically depicted as savage and the European colonizer is usually depicted as civilized, Conrad, argues Bratlinger, depicts the white colonizer as the savage. Bratlinger wants us to understand that Conrad isn’t suggesting that the depths of Africa is a place of savagery, but the depths of colonialism is savagery, and such savagery is best illustrated in this text through Kurtz and his madness.",RebellionIntoMoney,2021-01-30T03:36:47Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,1

Is it OK for someone to publish a book with the n-word today? No, of course not, but back then Mark Twain wanted to show not just the real way people talked, but to make his viewer uncomfortable and to challenge his views.

l85yvw_7,l85yvw,"That's fair. I've seen several posts of people bringing up heart of darkness as difficult to openly discuss due to the language/dialogue of the book -- which, if true, makes sense not to teach it. I will admit I haven't read it in 15 years. 

I thought the point of HoD was not the now-dated way his spoke about race but imperialism and the hierarchy that was used to justify it. I think it is possible to discuss without some of the drawbacks and whitewashing of HoD. Imperialism is still affecting people worldwide and being written about by the people it affects. 

If the agenda is about the widespread racism of the time, I think that this message is muddied. There are books about race from that time period that exemplify this problem. We tend to teach ""progressive"" points of view but people who saw themselves as racist wrote incredibly racist books. I think only showing incidents when progressives were ""dated"" doesn't do the problem justice. But would that even be teachable?

 I think imperialism is something not seen a lot or talked about on book lists. I would like to see it be able to be discussed. I guess for me whether or not to teach it depends on how difficult teachers feel it is to teach.",pineapplesf,2021-01-30T01:19:10Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,7
l85yvw_8,l85yvw,"> Achebe's lecture on Heart of Darkness is postcolonial criticism. That is the criticism I'm referencing here, that is what you called juvenile. 

You are a liar, and not a good one.

Here is what I actually said, quoted for you:

> Confusing Marlow and Conrad is a juvenile error.

I did not 'call postcolonial criticism juvenile' at large, as you implied. That was spectacularly dishonest of you. I said nothing of the sort.

I also did not 'call Acheve's lecture on HOD juvenile', as you subsequently claimed, in your attempt to back away from your earlier attempt to misrepresent what I said.

What I said, and have quoted again, is that conflating an author and a narrator -- let alone a *secondary* narrator, which is what Marlow is -- is a juvenile error. And it is.

Marlow wants to get to Kurtz as soon as possible and thinks his arrival would be beneficial for Kurtz, especially given the rumors of his illness. Thus if Kurtz knew about Marlow's coming and the rivets that were delaying him, Kurtz would also want that resolved as soon as possible.

I don't want to spoil anything or read too much into this line but Kurtz' desires are a big topic in the book and this interpretation would gel with that -- particularly with the contrast between Marlow's understanding of Kurtz' desires vs reality.",AutumnMunin,2022-06-15T17:35:45Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,1

There is a sense of adventure in almost all his books. A romantic view of the seven seas. In my opinion this book is a story of how circumstances bring a man to a certain place. There, he has to face himself and his fears. In this novel Conrad is a spectator of life, describing what he sees. I find it strange to call him a colonialist. He was simply a product of his times, with a greater gift of observation and storytelling than most others. He can hardly be judged after our modern standards. There is a deep sense of drama in his stories, and this is certainly not missing here.

I think it's normal that these comments by Marlow slip through your fingers because they are indeed long and easy to forget. I think that Conrad wanted to remind readers that Marlow was telling an story to passengers on a boat. He was just telling his friends what he was thinking at the time- he did not write this story or have time to edit it.

I'm curious as to why you hate Marlow as a character so much? I feel the Conrad sets him up as a kind of western mystic, so I read him as quite wise and good, rather than a total asshole.

Same with Secret Agent, I don't see Conrad holding any particularly politically aligned views - both books I interpret as critiques of the status quo, but written to be entertaining for his contemporaries too (Like Dickens).

I recently re-read the whole thing (I hate having unfinished books and just wanted to be done with it for real) but because it's been years and I wasn't sure where I stopped I had to start over at the beginning.

I wouldn't say I liked it, but on re-read as an adult it was much more clear to me why this is still being read today.  The themes and tone are heavy, but it's written so well.  I actually realized that I had finished the book the first time (rather than not finished it, as I had thought) because there were so many passages that resonated so much I distinctly remembered reading them the first time round.

**Heart of Darkness** isn't an easy read or one I would likely recommend, but the things I hated about it as a teenager were primarily that it came off (to me) as incredibly, super racist.  If you've read Chinua Achebe's critiques of HoD, that's essentially the take I had of it at the time.

Re-reading it, I get a totally different interpretation.  I no longer see it as an author that is incomprehensibly, unforgivably amoral, but an attempt at describing events and attitudes that *were.*  Conrad essentially captured a part of history so naturally abhorrent that I hated him for exposing me to it.  Imo he's not even really describing Africa in HoD, he's using Africa as a means of describing, in horrifying detail and symbolism, the attitudes tied with colonization and how inherently corrupting it is.",SteamboatMcGee,2019-12-04T16:32:31Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,1

the movie Aoocalypse Now is loosley based on it, so i don't know if that will help ... but A.N. is better than Heart of Darkness, imo.

i've read a lot of classics, and i find Conrad ""muddy"" to read ... i agree that he is NOT the clearest author of his time. 

so, historically, HoD was written after the grotesque massacres and torture and truly hideous crimes against African people of the Congo by King Leopold II of Belgium. maybe check out the wiki on him, it can sometimes help to know some historical details. Conrad was not born in England, but England was heavy heavy into it's massive colonial annexation of the globe ... and many other European nations were doing their best to grab as much ""free land"" as they could before England scooped it all up - the New World was pretty much all gobbled up between Spain, Portugal, England and France; Africa was pretty much all that was left to despoil.

5h32rx_1,5h32rx,"I had a similar reaction to *The Sound and the Fury* by Faulkner.  I mean, look, it's obviously a masterpiece.  It's obviously brilliant and beautiful.  Even the smallest parts of it are wonderful.  It's beautifully crafted and wonderfully structured and the writing is incredible.  

But that also makes it an incredibly frustrating read for me.  Because some works will have meaning in their structure, or the plot points, or the imagery, or the word choice.  But *TSaTF* has meaning in all of those things.  So I find myself trying to dive in and figure out the meaning of each of those things, every time I read it.  And it ends up being beautiful but exhausting.  

But that's a good thing.  And here's why: 

Most books, I can read one time and never pick them up again.  I know the story, I know what it's about and where it's going.  So there's no reason to read it a second time.  Especially when there are so many books out there that I haven't read yet.

But something as dense as *TSaTF* or *Heart of Darkness* is something that you can read over and over for the rest of your life, because every time you pick it up, you're going to notice something new.  It's not quite like reading the book for the first time.  But it is a book that slowly opens up every time you read it.  And as you gain more experience -- as a reader and a person -- you're going to see new things and new perspectives that you didn't pick up on the first time.  

So the book ends up being a way to measure your own growth and change as a person.  And that's really cool.

You don't have to understand it all right now.  If you did pick up on everything, then there would be no reason to read the book again.  This is a book that you can read again in 5 years, or 10 years, or 50 years, and figure out new things.  The fact that you're aware of things lingering underneath that you can't quite see yet speaks well of you as a reader and also speaks well of the book.

If you're going to teach this book, then you might have to set aside your desire for beauty. Like most profound literature, HoD focuses on the dark side of humanity, not the light side. Consider the title alone:

Marlow journeys into Africa, which used to be called the ""dark continent"" so he is literally travelling into the heart of darkness. But at the same time, Kurtz has been through experiences which have shown him the deep darkness within a human being (morally, psychologically, spiritually). So we could see *Kurtz*, not Marlow, as the character who has *taken the journey* into the heart of darkness; the darkness within himself. Then again, Marlow is going in search of Kurtz, so he is on a journey toward *the man who is* the heart of darkness. It's a multi-faceted phrase, and this is just a consideration of the book's title!

But darkness is the theme, not the beautiful. Maybe that's why the book is so fascinating. Beauty is fairly superficial and simplistic (and not very realistic) whereas the dark heart of humanity is profound and complex. ",redpill-booklover,2016-12-07T23:58:00Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,3

It is quite frankly, similar to one of those tales of hardship and heroism that you see all the time around veterans day/remembrance day, with the tag line ""Thank our troops"". 

You know how your parents used to tell you not to waste food because they worked hard to put it on the table? You can almost look at Heart of Darkness from that perspective, don't waste your rubber kids! Some colonial officer gave up his humanity to get it to you from the deepest heart of the Congo!

I went to school in China for a few years, and even in the 21st century, you had those tales of communist war heroes battling the nationalists, giving up their lives and liberty so you don't have to live under the evil nationalist government. Or the production heroes who sacrificed everything in the great leap forward to produce more steel. Hence why for years and years, I insisted that Heart of Darkness must have been a pro-colonialism book that approached it from a ""thank your local colonialist"" perspective. After all, although the book did mention the horrors that colonialist has inflicted on the Africans, Conrad's writing did feel quite racist at times, and the struggle was purely focused on the Europeans.

5h32rx_7,5h32rx,"Sure. In academia English students are required to write literary criticisms on novels they read. There's several different types, including the two I mentioned, that help the student analyze the text from a certain viewpoint. Socio-historicism looks at the author and culture at the time to understand the text. Marxism analyzes class struggle and historical trends. Specifically in Heart of Darkness, Socio-his. is fairly easy: Conrad himself was very similar to the character Marlow. He traveled a lot, even down the exact river the characters in the book are sailing on, and he worked in the Congo for a short time before he was disillusioned. One could easily make connections from Conrads life. Marxism is also pretty easy to see in the novel. There's the proletariat (Indigenous people) and the bourgeois (Kurtz and other whites).

66i0ze_1,66i0ze,"I love Heart of Darkness, so when I first read about it's purported racism and, for example, Achebe's views on it, I was taken aback. I used to disagree and thought that the accusations of racism were just over-intepretation and reading into things that weren't there.

But as I re-read it, more and more I could see where these criticisms were coming from. Certainly, I think there's a strong case to be made that the book and Conrad are quite anti-colonialist, and portray the natives in a sympathetic light. Conrad is downright progressive for his time. That's the operative thing there though, for his time. Because what I came to see, and what I think many of the accusations of race talk about are the passive, almost in-built things that are a product of their time. Things like Africa being 'one of the dark places of the Earth', and all the inherent implications in the language and imagery that the natives are more savage and less civilised than Europeans. 

I think it's important to recognise that bias and have it in the back of one's mind when reading. Though equally, I think it's important to recognise that Conrad was definitely progressive for the time too.",AtavisticArsonist,2017-04-20T22:54:30Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,1

66i0ze_5,66i0ze,"i understand where you are coming from, but i would argue that it wasn't actually that far back, it was published in 1899 and completely disregards evidence of the time on the history of African people and labels them as being savages for no real reason other than racism, for example the university of Timbuktu had existed since the 12th century and only really collapsed due to the slave trade, and the example of the Congo Basin where the novel is set, there has been engineering advances and art dating back years with evidence of strong and stable civilization in the area.

I feel as though the racism of the novel is so persistent and a constant that it would be an overshadow of the novel if you overlooked it as being historical, if its still going to be a popular and relevant novel today then it needs to exist within today's times and be viewed as such.

Same with feminism in classics such as Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights, they where both shocking for the time and went against the status quo of perceptions of women, and then set the pace of other novels, where as Heart of Darkness was just the continuation of European ethnocentrism, no challenging nature to it when it comes to race.

So the novel to me, will always be racist, as it ignored evidence in the time to follow European ethnocentrism, so the racism is relevant today, as it actually was then, people then where just more racism, not ignorant.",Dragon_Box,2017-04-21T19:02:14Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,5

c1c8g4_1,c1c8g4,"I know im late af, but this book is too often misunderstood (including by me on my first attempt) i have to write why i think it is both not racist and a very well written book. On my first read i thought this was a simple story made over complicated by the nonstop metaphores and i thought it was overrated and racist. But i read it again thinking i must have missed something and took a lot more time to make sure i fully understood everything that he was saying.

 First off this book is told as the narrator says marlow likes to tell stories: ""to him the meaning of an episode was not like a kernel, but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze"". There isnt really any ""good"" or ""bad"" characters in this book. The point of the story isnt to paint the indigenous people or the pilgrims in a good or bad light. Its just a reflection of human nature, told to illuminate the darkness of human nature and human psychology with the kernel that is marlows tale. Its about how people become what their surroundings make them.  He uses the words savage because at first glance thats what these people appear to him as. Some of them are cannibals, they have customs that horrify him at first, they are what he sees as man in a completely ""wild"" state. But as the story progresses and he goes deeper into the heart of darkness he starts to understand that he is the same as them deep down, he just has the benefit of ""growing up with a police station on one corner and a butcher on the other"". He talks about how all the pilgrims leave their homes with glorious visions of bringing light to the dark and helping the indigenous people, but as they are surrounded by death, given absolute power over a people, and free from consequences these perfectly reasonable men transform. The fools as he says who came to this country with greed in mind are too preoccupied with the constant search for ivory to be taken completely by the heart of darkness. Instead, as he says, they fall victim to the flabby, weak chinned devil that takes the form of apathy toward human life which manifests in violence toward the ""savages"" and indifference to the deaths of the people that came down with them on this ""noble"" quest. But the more thoughtful people like marlow who came for adventure and kurtz who came to try to bring light to the darknees so to speak are taken by the heart of darkness and it drives kurtz insane and almost drives marlow insane. Kurtz is ""great"" because of his ability to infulince, and even though he leaves with good intentions this causes him to be much more dangerous than the greedy short sighted men. As for the sexism in this book. Many women of the time were very restricted in what they could do and therefore many of them were trapped deep inside civilization. When he says that women live in their own worlds he is referring to women like his aunt or kurtz's girlfriend who see this whole endeavor as a benevolent quest because they dont understand the darkside and corruptability of the minds of men. And to be clear not all women are portrayed this way, for example the older women who ""guards the gates of darkness"" clearly had much more of an idea of what marlow was getting himself into than he did or did any of the ""happy foolish faces that went through that office"". This book is largely about the evils that ordinary men are capable of under the right circumstances. Im not saying women arnt also capable of such things but at the time women were not often given power and therefore wernt given the opportunity to become savage like these men. 

Overall this book is about what colonialism does to both the pilgrims and the natives. It portrays colonialism in a VERY negative light. It contrasts at the start on the ship how from the safety of london these explorers are heroes who are bringing light to the darkness of the world with the horrors that actually happen on these expeditions and how ordinary people dont understand it. 

Lastly, i could completely see how this would not be fun read at all for women and especially for people of african descent. The same as a book about the holocaust would not be a fun read for a jewish person because those two events are alsmost the same except for the original intentions of the oppressors. But to be clear, by no means do i think the pilgrims are intended to be the protagonists. The pilgrims become the devils of the land, but not because they are inherently evil but because all people are corruptable when given power in the heart of darkness.",curl8r65,2019-10-12T00:52:48Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,1

49guci_1,49guci,"I just read this excellent novel as well. 

> what prompted Marlow's loyalty to Kurtz?

Kurtz is the only white man who has managed to 'tame' Africa. In my opinion, the woman with the bracelets who raises her hands up is the personification of Mother Africa. By controlling her and her people, Kurtz has proved himself the master of his environment. Marlow admires Kurtz because he is a hunter, never the *hunted*. Kurtz' warrior qualities come out several times: Dying and sick, he still makes an attempt to crawl back into the forest. He subdues the natives brutally; paying the iron price (heads on sticks) rather than the gold price (civilisation, trade). He is virile, leaving bits of himself behind (painting at the Manager's station), and spreading his name throughout the continent. Kurtz is primal, the seed-sower, a masculine force. Even his last words (The horror!) are aggressive and not at all sentimental; this lack of feeling was so singular that Marlow felt the need to lie to Kurtz's fiancée about what he said.

> What is the dichotomy that we're seeing here?

Do not that even though Kurtz is a primal hunter, he is not a conqueror. Marlow, perhaps reflecting Conrad's own perspective on colonialism, feels contempt for conquerors: ""For that you want only brute force...nothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others."" The difference between Kurtz and the Manager/Pilgrims is that he dominates the natives by seeing them as human threats and equals, whereas the Manager/Pilgrims, like most stereotypical colonisers, see the indigenous people as inferior slaves. Kurtz treats the Africans brutally not because he thinks he is superior, but because he *needs* to be thought superior. Hence he advises Marlow to appear 'as a god' to the natives; he knows that only a god can subjugate men. 

Another difference between Kurtz and the Manager/Pilgrims is the type of 'colonialist' they represent. Kurtz represents colonialism before the 18th Century, in the model of Aeneas and classical heroes: Brutal, a warrior, but thoroughly manly. He does elevate himself into a deity, but this is done openly, without tricks and ruses; the heads on sticks illustrate how open-handed Kurtz is. On the other hand, the Manager is a conniving, scheming bureaucrat who has to achieve dominance using tricks. Similarly, the Pilgrims conquer natives using religious doctrines; they are intermediaries between God and the natives, while Kurtz cuts out the middleman and is God himself. Conrad/Marlow approves of Kurtz's style of colonialism, which is 'harder' but also perversely honourable, while holding the Manager/Pilgrims and their modern, diplomatic colonialism with contempt. 

I think that if you have more questions about Heart of Darkness, as we all do, the best thing to do is to read Youth. Youth is the short story that Conrad published alongside Heart of Darkness, and explores Marlow as a character during his early trip to Asia. It gives you more perspective about why Marlow is the way he is - for he is 'seen and not heard' in Heart of Darkness - and why he might be drawn to Kurtz.

49guci_2,49guci,"This is the second post about Heart of Darkness I have seen in the past few days, and I am pleased because it's one of my favourite books which I could talk about till the cows come home. Someone asked about the book a day or two ago, here's my answer if you want to read some of my thoughts on it: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/49bt3x/i_just_finished_reading_joseph_conrads_heart_of/d0r2rvr

Interesting write-up, as for your question:

> Having said that, I'll take this time to ask you, the community, one question that is specifically nagging at me. That is, what prompted Marlow's loyalty to Kurtz? Upon his arrival, Marlow can clearly see that this man has committed atrocities, raiding villages and sticking the conquered heads on pikes. His inner dialogue suggest he disapproves, yet at other times he seems to hold some kind of grudging admiration for the ivory trader, and even sides with him against the manager and Pilgrims. What is the dichotomy that we're seeing here?

I'll give my view on that, which is naturally coming from the same perspective as the post which I linked there. So as I said, Kurtz is the literal embodiment of the dark aspects of human nature, a 'universal genius' who has thrown away all the 'civilizing' and restraining elements of western society. Kurtz is, in a sense, more than just a man, but becomes almost a part of the wilderness itself and the physical embodiment of a humanity that is completely unhindered by morals, societal pressures etc., as well as all the evil things which can be done as a result. I'll quote something from the book: 

> ""...the heavy, mute spell of the wilderness - that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of gratified and monstrous passions""

and a page or two before he describes Kurtz as rising to meet him:

> ""Like a vapour exhaled by the earth""

Marlow first hears about Kurtz through the stories and whispers of others, but immediately I think recognizes this in Kurtz and the further he goes into the wilderness, the more he begins to see something of himself in Kurtz as well. I read a good quote which states that he ""quickly turns towards Kurtz as the practical and psychological goal towards which he travels, stressing that his search for Kurtz is connected with his own 'destiny of life'"". That's why when he finally meets Kurtz he becomes loyal to him, he sees in Kurtz the 'shadow' of himself and someone who is striving for same thing. That is the dichotomy. To some degree he obviously respects Kurtz from the conventional perspective, grounded in western society, as well, as someone who is/was a 'genius' (a writer, musician, painter, politician etc.). But more important is the fact that they are both looking for the same thing, the 'truth', which is knowledge about mans real nature. Marlow sees Kurtz as someone who can help him see the truth, which as I say, is what makes him loyal to him and in the end both of them are enlightened. Marlow even describes it at the very start of the book:

> It is the farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience. It seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about me—and into my thoughts. It was somber enough, too—and pitiful—not extraordinary in any way—not very clear either. No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light 

The difference is of course, in how Marlow and Kurtz each react to this knowledge that they have gained.",Rimbaud82,2016-03-08T12:11:06Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,2

8fcdb5_1,8fcdb5,"Nietzschean interpretation but requires familiarity with The Birth of Tragedy:

> This author shows how Conrad used the contrast between the Apollinian and Dionysian to structure the form and content of the novel: how the contrast holds together the important artistic decisions made by Conrad; how Conrad midwived the rebirth of ancient Greek tragedy as the Congo tragedy—the rape of the Congo by Europeans in the late 19th century; and how this could have happened—how the psyches of the Europeans unraveled in the Congo jungle.

> In Conrad’s rendition, the unrestrained competitive and hostile Dionysian life forces at the heart of nature not only power the teeming jungle but also lurk in the inherited instincts of mankind. The European search for ivory in the Congo brought these primitive instincts to the surface, out of their holes like serpents with venom of a mixture of desire and hate. The high ground of the novel is an irony—in the Congo clothes do not make the man. The European exploiters dressed in the very proper tropical whites are savage in behavior while naked man-eaters are restrained in behavior.

8fcdb5_2,8fcdb5,"Marlow thinks that on his deathbed, Kurtz “[relives] his life again in every detail... during that supreme moment of complete knowledge”, suggesting that “the knowledge [of his evil ways] came to him... only at the very last”. It seems to be that Kurtz initially went out into the jungle to “civilize” the natives (and gain ivory, wealth, and power), and to do so, he decided to make himself a god to them. However, he becomes corrupted over time, and starts to act out of unrestrained evil, to the point where he is simply a “hollow” man who is under the control of the devil (or something like that), and fails to realize how far he’s fallen. It’s only on his deathbed that he sees reality, and what he learns, along with the knowledge that he’s going to die, is summed up by his famous lines. When Marlow visits his widow, he sees her (being a woman who hasn’t seen the jungle makes her doubly this) and her view of Kurtz as a “great humanitarian” as too innocent and naive to know the horrific truth or Kurtz’s evil, and by extension, the evil and hypocrisy of the European colonization. By being unable to admit the inherent evil in man (the “heart of darkness” if you will) to another person, Marlow has a moral defeat, since this blindness to such a thing is why he “sided” with Kurtz in the first place (seeing the hypocrisy of the Manager and the settlers as unbearable), and chose the nightmare of truth. So by not telling her, he is letting he nightmare of hypocrisy continue. This means that by telling his story on the boat, Marlow is giving a confession and telling what he thinks he should’ve told to the widow, giving him a moral victory. But that’s just my take on it",Markcross23,2018-10-22T01:16:40Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,2
8fcdb5_3,8fcdb5,"To perhaps add something to this, and maybe bring together the two questions in the OP: All of the various forms of Modernism I know of tended to revolve around the destruction of the old social order and symbols of civilisation, and the question of how something could be built from it - in particular after the enormous destruction of WWI.

In a similar way, Heart of Darkness is concerned with what happens when ""civilisation"" is stripped away. It may seem trite to say that this is very literally represented by Marlowe's journey from Europe, to the Outer Station which is in some disarray, and then into Kurtz camp. 

In this context, it's always seemed to me that the horror isn't just the savagery he's witnessed or brutalities he's committed, but the idea that by stripping away the trappings of civilisation he has revealed his essential brutality.

I think this provides a couple of reasons Marlow might lie to Kurtz' widow. First, just that he realises that the Kurtz he knew was not the Kurtz she knew, as she only knew his outer, civilised person and not the brutal despot underneath. Secondly, he believes that she wouldn't *understand* the truth, that the horror that Kurtz was talking about is hidden from her by the culture around her.

To me, the whole effect is like experiencing a feverish dream that somehow speaks of and alludes to inexpressible fears buried in the darkness of our collective subconscious without ever explicitly drawing them out. I think in this aspect it's arguably one of the first modernist novels: it's not so much what happens in the novel or what is said, but what isn't said and the way the hypnotic rhythm of the descriptive language exerts a strange and unsettling effect upon the reader that gives a sense of something disturbing afoot and of primal dark matters of our human nature that might be best hidden beneath the surface being glimpsed out the corner of our eye through murky water... like dark ominous moving shadows that can't be fully resolved and that seem to disappear when you look at them and leave you feeling both unsettled and wondering if you ever really saw them in the first place.

Kurtz is a symbol of the supposedly civilised nations of Europe's parasitic presence and their imperialism in Africa. Kurtz counters imperialist propaganda that 'the white man' is civilising others abroad.

Heart of Darkness was written off the back of Joseph Conrad's own experiences in Africa  so it is almost historical record in that regard.

The atrocities committed by colonists in the Congo were some of worst recorded in the imperialised world. Companies operating there were given free license to collect the rubber there and quite literally the natives were put on the chopping block. The population decline borders genocidal levels.

49bt3x_1,49bt3x,"Well as others have said colonialism is obviously a hugely important element, Conrad himself went to the Congo (though not necessarily in the same manner as Marlow) where he saw and experienced things that left a serious impression on him...so of course one aspect of the 'Heart of Darkness' is the horrific nature of colonialism (though Conrad seems to have had somewhat conflicting views on the subject). The colonialists mistreat and abuse the natives in their pursuit of wealth as represented by ivory (which has also been interpreted from a Marxist perspective). 

However, it isn't as straightforward as the happy natives being abused by the evil colonialists, the natives and especially the place in which they live (the jungle) is genuinely represented as something dark, mysterious and sinister...I think the writing style perfectly conveys this and it's one reason that I loved the book so much, but another thing I find interesting about it is that he gets at the cyclical nature of these things. The fact that the book begins and ends in the mouth of the River Thames is significant as London is centre of the worlds largest imperial power, but right at the very start of the book he also writes “And this also . . . has been one of the dark places of the earth.” Just as 'Darkest Africa' is in Conrad's time, so Britain once appeared to the Roman colonialists (dark, wild, mysterious etc.). 

So while the physical realities of colonialism are crucial, I don't think that quite gets at what Conrad was attempting to convey, which for me is the deeper psychological factors which are inherent in/behind colonialism, or the actions taken in a colonial context (such as control, domination, murder, mutilation and so on). So the idea that, for all the niceties and culture of western civilization, there is something inside all humans which is wild and unrestrained, which be can be brought out in particular circumstances (in this case the african jungle). European colonialism in this time period is only one manifestation of something that goes much deeper. This is one reason why I think it lends itself so well to other adaptions, the fact that it is set in the 19th/early 20th century is somewhat secondary...human nature does not change whether it's the Belgians in the Congo, Americans in Vietnam, Spanish conquistadors in Peru (as in *Aguirre, The Wrath of God* which was deeply influenced by the book) or countless other examples. After all it's in the title of book the *Heart* of Darkness, where the journey through the river symbolizes Marlow's journey into his soul/pysche (deeper and deeper until he reaches Kurtz). I think Apocalypse Now does a fantastic job of this.

 Orson Welles has an excellent quote about it, which I think gets towards what I am saying:

> The Heart of Darkness could be described as a deliberate masterpiece or a downright incantation. A fine piece of prose work at the least; its best aspects are an artful compound of sympathy for humankind and a high tragical disgust. Its successful contrivance of mood hides its craft as an octopus hides in its own ink, and almost *we are persuaded that there is something, after all -- Something essential waiting for all of us in the dark alleys of the world: Aboriginally loathsome, immeasurable and certainly nameless.*

Kurtz is the literal embodiment of this, someone who has thrown off all the pretense of western culture and lives as a demi-god amongst the 'savages'. The horror that he sees is just that, the true nature of man, or at least his underlying nature. There are lots of ways in which people have interpreted this book and I am sure my interpretation is only one aspect of it, plus it's not even necessarily correct, but that's how I read into it.

9m0ghu_1,9m0ghu,"The non-fiction book King Leopold’s Ghost is about the horrors committed in the Congo by the Belgian colonial regime. The author spends quite a few pages on Conrad, and suggests that actually we’ve all spent way too much time analyzing Heart of Darkness. If you look at Conrad’s life and writings, his intent is actually very clear: he witnessed horrible men doing horrible things in the Congo, and wrote Heart of Darkness to protest and reveal that horror. There is never anything wrong with coming up with your own interpretation of a book of course. But the more we try to squeeze an internal, psychological message from Heart of Darkness, the more disservice I think we do to the reality that millions of Congolese were murdered by evil men who came to the jungle believing they were the civilized ones.

With his self-referential link, the OP is demonstrating the self-referential emptiness inherent in Kurtz's character. Just like the self-referring link, which is empty, Kurtz can only become a savage by referencing his egoism and his self, which ironically doesn't exist *without the context of others and a society*. So by becoming a savage in the wild, Kurtz gains everything but loses himself. This is the true moral lesson of Conrad: you will gain everything but in the process, lose everything, making you empty. This is what is meant by ""the heart of darkness."" It's not that the core is dark, it's that the core is nothing.

4d1rzt_2,4d1rzt,">Are they about the duality of man? About good and evil?

I don't think Conrad makes a clear distinction about who is good in the novel. Although Marlow notes that Kurtz’s expression of horror ‘had the appalling face of glimpsed truth’*, Conrad has Marlow ‘[peep] over the edge’* yet he does not succumb to the darkness that penetrates Kurtz’s heart. I found it ironic that _Heart of Darkness_ ends with Kurtz’s Intended being told of his death, since for me it was Conrad's way of possibly commenting on people who do not question, or acknowledge, world events (such as colonialism) occurring around them, and they are those who are uncivilised and have darker hearts than people like Kurtz.  

There is also a limit to what a work of literature can say, and how it says it. The frame narrative of _HoD_ renders Marlow’s story as secondary to what occurs on board the ship, yet its importance is arguably principal to what the text as a whole “says”. Conrad, through this narrative structure, places greater emphasis on what occurs within Marlow’s tale, and what the characters within his story do and do not say - Marlow presents the reader with expectation that Mr. Kurtz will fulfil the rumours that surround him. This sustained, yet flawed, belief throughout the novel possibly highlights Conrad’s opinion that human interaction and communication, both verbal and aural, offers expectations that distort, destroy or conceal reality. The reader, through the unnamed speaker, is Conrad’s intended audience and although subject to the different “voices” within the novel, is expected to come away from the novel with far greater insight.

Conrad was showing the colonial world as it would have been seen by a white participant, and thus he is allowing the horror to be depicted without overt editorial. This is much like a good documentary, except he's focalized it through a character who is at times indifferent, and at times as equally complicit as any of the other pilgrims.  I wish I had the text in front of me, as in my multiple times through it I identified passages in which Conrad is obviously satirizing Marlow and showing him, at the very least, as a deeply flawed if interesting character. One of Conrad's purposes in making Marlow a character in a story being told by the ultra-narrator is that he is separating himself from Marlowe as much as he can. It's crucially important to carefully read the interstices in Marlow's narration. ",,2009-07-09T14:38:11Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Heart of Darkness,6

bkd1w_1,bkd1w,"Most scholars would say yes, it is racist.  It is a reductive and simplistic view of African culture from a European lens that helped justify colonialism and imperialism.  If you are interested in researching this further, look up '[Postcolonial Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcolonial_literature)' which is an interpretive approach that focuses on the portrayals of cultures and the legacy of colonialism in literature.

Achebe's [Things Fall Apart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_Fall_Apart) is the most famous rebuttal to the kind of portrayal given by those like Conrad.

Heart of Darkness is a classic in spite of its racist portrayal of Africans because of its philosophical treatment that we (all of humanity) are not rational beings. Even the 'civilized European' is only a few steps away from being a primitive.  Novelists explored these themes in great detail during what is called '[Modernism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism)'.  It was a reaction to the rationalism and positivism (which argued we are rational beings) which were popular in the previous literary era of realism.

The novel takes place on the Thames. I always thought that was the point. I don't think it's really chauvinistic, I think it's generally misanthropic. No character in the novel is worthy of praise.

While many argue that Conrad's racism surfaces in the piece, it is important to keep in mind that the mere fact Conrad suggests that colonialism is a negative and violent act was a radical view point for its time. If you can escape Conrad's racist descriptions, you will recognize Heart of Darkness as one of the first critical commentaries of colonialism and racism.

This was one of my favorite works of colonial literature when I studied it in college. You can feel the sadness and self-consciousness in the prose. If you read very critically and personally you will start to see Heart of Darkness illustrating some of the darker aspects of the human condition, and the potentially gruesome ways in which people can treat each other.

1q5mvg_1,1q5mvg,"If you mention the historical context I am surprised that politically you only mention the 'leftists'. True Orwell was fairly disenchanted with Communism and especially Stalinism at the time he wrote the book but nationalism in general is a major theme in it and the hatred of otherness that is envoked by nationalist leaders/dictators. It was written in 1949 only four years after the end of WWII after all, so Orwell's experience with facism as well as communism, both totalitarian regimes, have influenced this work. After all Orwell was one of several intellectuals who went to Spain to fight facism as brilliantly documented in his book Homage to Catalonia. 
In connection to Heart of Darkness otherness plays an important role here as well. The civilised world vs. the 'savages' in their wild almost impenetrable environment. In Kurtz's report to the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs Kurtz advises to exterminate all the brutes. On the other hand of course Kurtz has created his own minature totalitarian system. Which demonstrated the duality of human nature and the corrupting power of power(if that makes any sense).
Heart of Darkness in general tries to show that even the outwardly most 'civilized' person can become 'savage' which is also a point in 1984 where torture is a natural part of the system (Room 101, which is ironically located in the Ministry of Love).

4v2o95_1,4v2o95,"Often times works become part of the literary canon (i.e., become considered ""classics"") not because they're the most enjoyable read, but because they exemplify something unique and noteworthy. They may epitomize a social or historical moment, such as The Great Gatsby does with the roaring twenties or The Grapes of Wrath the Great Depression. Or they may reflect a pivotal moment in literature, exemplifying a change in aesthetics or a wholly original and unreproducible work. I think Heart of Darkness does both. It gives a human perspective on a particular moment in history: the scramble for Africa. It is also a one of a kind experiment in tone and imagery. 

The novella certainly captures the uncivilized nature of colonialism, and serves as a sort of time capsule of the attitudes and activities of those who partook in it. It also exhibits a unique type of prose. The tone of the novella is very murky and conveys a perpetual state of uneasiness in many readers. It portrays the narrator's impression of his experiences rather than seeking to accurately describe the actual settings and events.
