11riloq_1,11riloq,"I absolutely love The Secret History.

I feel like the novel manages a scathing satire of elitism in academia while simultaneously showcasing its appeal in a relatable way.

Richard is pretentious and arrogant. But he is also extremely human. It is very hard not to be drawn into the mysterious and exclusive circles in the same way he is.

It's amazing that despite how thoroughly The Secret History shows us that these academic elites are miserable, Tartt still manages to make it seem desirable.",,2023-03-15T03:45:27Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,1

I too read THE GOLDFINCH, which I really liked while I was reading it but zero percent stick w me

THE SECRET HISTORY has one of the literal funniest passages I've ever read...the bit where Bunny is writing the paper about John Donne, and keeps talking about ""metahemeralism"" - just kills 

in such a dark and frightening book, really something to get those little funny moments that somehow fit and aren't jarring

11riloq_4,11riloq,"Ok, randomly I happened to read The Secret History and The Magicians back to back reading them both for the first time and I was sort of shocked by how much writing style in a few parts, characters and setting were super similar. (Just in a “how the heck did I manage to pick a book and a book that clearly influenced that book to read at the exact same time??” Dumb luck, grabbed two books to stuff in my bag for travel reading on a trip)

There are parts that are still sort of difficult to disambiguate in my head. 

I’m not saying you should read The Magicians on these grounds but I really want to know if anyone else besides me picked that up or noticed how very much The Magicians borrows from The Secret History. It’s super obvious to me and I never once heard anyone else say it, instead making the obvious parallels between Narnia and Harry Potter, but I actually thought Magicians borrowed more in style, setting and characters from The Secret History than any fantasy work.",Sexycornwitch,2023-03-15T02:45:19Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,4

In comparison, while it had its own charm, The Goldfinch seemed boring. It was enjoyable, don’t get me wrong, I liked it overall, but I guess I had my expectations way too high after The Secret History. The mystery throughout the entire story, the detailed interesting characters, the story itself all together made the experience of reading the book magical.

11riloq_12,11riloq,"I really wanted to like it, however at around the halfway mark it became more and more apparent that all the potential and expectations that the first chapters introduced to you were pointless.

Have in mind -- I was VERY engaged until that halfway mark and there's not really anything in particular that happened in the story which was a turn off, it was just not as good as it started and I slogged to the end with a new mindset in which I anticipated what I thought would be lazy and surely enough -- that's the direction the story went in.

I cared for every single one of the main group and was looking forward to get to know them... at the start. Yeah Richard is an unreliable narrator, but just because he's boring and suffers from a severe lack of personality it doesn't mean that the rest of the group should therefore all be lifeless and copies of one another.

It's like Donna knew how to write one (1) person and just copy pasted a sort of template among the main characters.

I'll try the Goldfinch, as I've heard a lot of acclaim for that one as well and the first 1/4 of The Secret History was good enough so that I don't give up on Tartt completely.",HellbenderXG,2023-03-15T05:47:15Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,12

The scene that stuck out most to me was when Henry told Richard that he actually enjoyed planning and murdering Bunny. That was a lightbulb moment where everything about Henry's actions suddenly made sense to me.

BUT people who love The Secret History DO NOT LIKE The Goldfinch and vice versa- it is comical how unanimous this is. I always read a thread when Donna Tartt's books are being discussed and have gone through so many posts. 

For The Goldfinch, there are many criticisms (much more than TSH from what I observed). It is too long, should've been crisp, not much is happening, ending feels rushed etc. I don't think any of these are wrong but I still loved it, I would re- read it again.The thing about TG is its spectacular writing- the book is very writing driven and not plot driven at all.  A lot of pages are about the MC's emotions. The whole book feels like a vibe, more than a story. Honestly I can say the story or plot is very secondary, it doesn't even matter much. And usually I prefer plot driven books, go figure ! 

Some sections in the book can drag, so if you give it a shot and feel so at a certain point in the story, try rushing past those pages (I didn't have to but again I'm assuming you being a TSH lover won't like The Goldfinch hah!) and see if it works for you.",PinkMoonbow,2023-07-28T09:43:06Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,10

1ahxrcs_1,1ahxrcs,"I think this book is one you can read at a surface level and catch most of it, or need a Classics degree to parse the minutiae of it. Very broadly though, Henry's ""problem with his passport"" is very much an inability to move forward. A death scene like this was also done in Harry Potter (I do wonder if the writer of those books, SheWhoShallNotBeNamed, may have taken direct inspiration from this) in the guise of a train station. In The Secret History, it's more of a split between The Fields of Asphodel and Limbo, which could make sense as Henry was a Catholic who really began to believe in Greek mythos. For more, read Dante's Inferno and the Odyssey.

Dreams in Greek Mythology would be viewed as prophecy, though those dreams could be a deception and you don't understand the true purpose of it. In this situation, they believe Richard has a fundamental part to play in their misadventures but are completely unaware what exact part he will ultimately play.",nartak,2024-02-03T21:27:04Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,1

It is in dealing with this release that the Judaeo-Christian morality of the students (despite their attempts to remove themselves from such ideas) are revealed, they are uncomfortable with the animalistic nature of what they have done and are thus destroyed.

I don't think that's what tartt was writing about.  I think she was writing about human nature and human relationships.  it doesn't really fit to a procedural type of theory because that's not the way people are.  I see just about everything in the book - especially the ""story"" and how it unfolds - as a direct and organic outcome of who each of them is and the ways their personalities react to and act on one another.  

to that extent I think it's a clever echo of actual Greek tragedy, where a person's fate is written right into their bones and happens to them because they are them.  

I disagree that Henry ""respects"" status and trust funds.  I don't know many profoundly gifted, certified-genius people.  none of us does I guess, because they're so rare by statistical definition.  but.

if you want a gripping first few pages, hell, gripping from the very first line with unlikeable characters, read Rebecca.

I'm really starting to wonder what people see in this book (The Secret History) and where they're coming from because atmospheric writing is not enough to keep me engaged for over 500 pages much less five. And with the attention span of today's society, I would venture to say that's probably also the case for most. So I'm deducing there is a deeper underlying reason why people like this book other than the ""atmospheric writing"" that people are purporting is the reason. I read an astute observation somewhere that people who like this book either miss the point entirely, or want to be a part of that lifestyle or both...

which doesn't say much other than: they're basic. no offense or anything. I'm just appalled at how much I find myself thinking: ""wow I literally don't care."" so many times throughout this first chapter. and genuinely wondering what the appeal is other than, other people must be living in such a drudge way as well to find this remotely interesting or fascinating in any way...

I certainly spent a lot of time trying to understand the characters, make up my mind about them, and even that wasn’t easy, which is unusual for me!
But what I can say with certainty is that this book has atmosphere! After The Secret History I read Donna Tartt’s famous novel The Goldfinch, and after doing so, I can say that Donna Tartt is a goddamn genius when it comes to language and creating an atmosphere. She’s compared to Dickens,actually,and if you read The Goldfinch and are familiar with Dickens’s Great Expectations, you will see why.

tkab5q_1,tkab5q,"It is my favourite book of all time. Like the characters in the book I am a Classics student at university and it was recommended to me for that reason and I read it during my first term at university. It had a huge effect on me and it was the first time I had really *loved* reading a book since I was 15 or 16 and as a result I got into reading again. Before I read *The Secret History* I read maybe one or two books a year, now I read more books per year than I can keep track of. But I love it for more reasons than that. I think it's fair to say that I have never spent more time thinking about a story than I have with this book. Ever since I first read it I've thought about it once or twice a month and even now, years after first reading it, I'm still getting revelations about the plot that didn't occur to me the last time I read it. For instance it only recently occurred to me that >!the reason Henry decided to tell Richard about the murder during the Bacchae was because, by taking Richard into his confidence, he knew that Richard would tell Henry if Bunny ever confessed to Richard about the murder, and therefore Henry would know to act against Bunny!<. That's kind of obvious I know but I'm slow lol. But that's just one example. I have plenty of similar revelations about the book that didn't occur to me until reflecting on it for a long time. I also love the whole theme of disillusionment throughout the novel - not just with the friend group but with everything they represent -- romanticism, aristocracy, classical education, hedonism -- all of it is destroyed in the final act of the book. >!Even Julian, the wise and benevolent mentor goes from an eccentric but loveable authority figure to proving himself to be a coward!<.

My first reading I actually listened to it as an audiobook with no idea what it was going to be about (had a long drive). Donna Tartt narrates and I think that made me fall in love with it even more, hearing each line the way she intended it to be read. The next few times I *physically* read the book (I spaced each reading a few years apart to keep it fresh) and found new things to think about each time. 

Rich character development (totally agree - all unlikeable but still drawn to them), fascinating plot… I love that Richard was the Everyman most of us, as readers, could more or less relate to…who got to peek behind the curtain and bring us into their privileged and bizarre world. I always found it to be a haunting story but with a satisfying conclusion. Sticks with you for a long time after reading.

tkab5q_5,tkab5q,"One of the best books I've ever read, but I look back on it more fondly than my actual reading experience as I found it a bit long. 

I went to a university that felt just like their college, where the student body is small, the campus is old, brick, and nestled in the same sort of climate, and there were probably only a handful of upperclassman classics majors (my roommate was one). I mean..I had some classes with 6 students total in 4th year chemistry courses!

Anyway, Donna Tartt's prose was fantastic. I don't encounter this type of writing often, as I don't often focus on reading literary fiction, but Margaret Atwood's writing is someone who's writing is on a similar level and I enjoy just as much. 

I've read two books similar to The Secret History; If We Were Villains (similar on the surface, but the depth of prose and atmosphere didn't quite get 'there' for me), and The Likeness by Tana French (group of PhD lit students living in a big old house in a quiet hamlet; the first 100 pages of police detective prep is a bit of a slog, but once the story gets going it's really good.

n1xehx_1,n1xehx,"I read *The Secret History* a while ago - too long to speak authoritatively towards the details of your post. But I have a visceral memory of reading it and the novel is honestly one of my absolute favorites. Probably due for a re-read. 

I sometimes flippantly refer to it as ""rose-colored glasses: the book."" I think a lot of the power of the work comes from how none of the secondary characters change through-out the story. Rather what changes is the lens through which the protagonist views them. Initially, everything is dripping with pathos and the group is an olive branch of normalcy and friendship. Then later the cracks start to show and an the idyll is lifted to show broken and terrible people. People who play at exalted language and enlightenment but are unworthy of basic fellowship. 

In guessing at your third and fourth points, though, I think Richard did strongly empathize with Charles even to the point of seeing Camilla as a sister, sexual attraction and all. Perhaps the reason so many men were attracted to her was another element of the parting of the veil - nothing changed but Richard became more aware of it and it is super uncomfortable for both him and the audience by proxy. Richard alternatingly unsure if he wants to be with her or wants things to be as before (perhaps even with a little of a Holden philosophy about him). I unfortunately do not have a strong memory of Judy.",XBreaksYFocusGroup,2021-04-30T17:52:48Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,1
n1xehx_2,n1xehx," 

I love The Secret History! One of my favorite books of all time and Donna Tartt is one of my favorite authors. As you said, the characters really stick with you and even though I read it about a year ago now, I still think about it regularly. It has been a while since I read this book however I can try to give you my two cents.

1. I think Henry killed himself for two reasons. In his eyes, his suicide was a poetic death something befitting a tragic hero. He would view himself as a martyr whose sacrifice allowed his friends to live on with their lives without having to face the consequences of their actions.  Secondly, he realized that they were on the verge of being found out and his whole world was collapsing. Henry never fit into the modern world. None of them really did but Henry was always the extreme. He was the best with the ancient languages, was obsessed with the 12 Great Civilizations, was the mastermind behind the Bacchanal but didn’t know about basic medicine or the moon landing. He didn’t fit into this world. Henry was a sociopath for whom the classical world provided a sense of superiority over others and a justification for his terrible actions. I remember there is a scene where Richard is talking to Henry in the garden and Henry says as much. That is why he was so close to Julian and longed for Camilla. They were his links to his idealized Classical World. The only people who were reasonably able to understand him. However, once Julian turned on the group and Henry pieced out that they were all being used as Julian’s personal experiments, something in him broke. He never cared for other people and would have preferred to live in his  Homeric fantasy, no matter what was the human cost.  Once Charles entered the room with the gun, the game was up. If he hadn't killed himself and killed Charles then there would have been an investigation and Camilla would have never forgiven him. They would have almost certainly been found out. If both of them lived, one of them would have broken under pressure. Charles was already raving mad and drunk and out for blood. What was stopping him from snitching on everyone? Either way, his life is over. He would either end up in prison or isolated and betrayed by the only people who understood him. Think about the epilogue. Everyone, including Richard and Camilla, ends up leading fairly benign lives. Francis is forced into a marriage, Richard is a lonely academic. Camilla is caring for her grandma and Charles is in rehab in Texas. Henry could have never assimilated into the world like that. In his mind, Julian and his friends allowed him to live in ""the Classical World of Homer and Plato"". Thus, he made the decision to kill himself. It was a poetic and heroic death in his mind. One that allowed all of his friends to live on with their lives without facing justice for their crimes while he could be a martyr. 
2. I think that is the point. You really see everything from Richard’s point of view. Indeed, any outside observer would probably think the whole crew is just a bunch of pretentious psychopaths. Bunny is a bit annoying, manipulative, and racist. However, nothing that he did justified killing him. However, Richard tells us the story in such a way that we see Bunny as this evil nuisance who must be eliminated. I think that is a testament to Donna Tartt’s writing. She really allows you to get swept away in the minds of the characters until you find yourself almost agreeing with them on taking out Bunny. I agree with you. Henry or Julian are the true villains of the story. However, Richard does not see it that way and he (Tartt ) is such a powerful storyteller that we buy into his view until you step back and look at the whole thing. 

I highly recommend reading the Goldfinch. It is not as good in my opinion as to the Secret History but it still holds up. You are right about the female characters and that is by design I believe. In the Goldfinch, there is a similar situation, and (minor spoiler) there is a moment where you realize the narrator is viewing women through rose-colored glasses. The same thing happens here. Richard views Camilla as this almost mythic seductress who is everything he could possibly want. For me, the Henry and Camilla thing came out of left field and I interpreted it as Richard not seeing the whole story in regards to Camilla. It’s the same thing with Judy. She is just a foil to Camilla. A basic girl with no depth. I do not think that Tartt is writing the female characters in a negative way but writing them as a man like Richard would see them. Either as something a bit beneath him or as a “Pixie Dream Girl”.

n1xehx_3,n1xehx,"If you haven’t read the goldfinch- definitely do! I liked it better than the secret history

Totally agree on your points. Especially #2, Bunny really was an asshole but as you read the book you almost feel chastised for thinking “he deserved what he got”. You see all the fallout with his funeral and how fucked up his so called friends were to do this to him. No matter how heinous he was as a person his friends had no right to take away his life. 

I also agree on camillas character she is mostly there for the male characters to fight over and suffers as a result. I do wish Donna fleshed her out more but since we’re seeing things from the male characters POV it’s possible we’re seeing her as Richard sees her. I don’t remember all the details but he seemed pretty infatuated with her so we might just be getting the one dimensional manic pixie dream girl character because that’s how he sees her.

ow35ga_1,ow35ga,"I don’t think she is. I really, really like Tartt — that’s my disclaimer. I *wish* she was being more critical of them, honestly, bc I love her writing style — but one of the reasons I like The Goldfinch so much more than The Secret History personally is the relative lack of completely insufferable characters in The Goldfinch — both books are totally populated by flawed, sometimes super shitty humans, but The Goldfinch’s flawed characters aren’t quite as precious about it & I don’t think you as a reader as supposed to find their flaws admirable or romantically tragic like I think you are in TSH. (Yikes, tangent.) Anyway, I’d love to be proved wrong! 

What makes me think you’re not is largely what little I know about Donna Tartt from that era. She wrote it surrounded by a literary in-crowd, including Bret Easton Ellis, and at a small town prestigious college like the one in the book. Obviously I can’t read her mind, but all of this circumstances make me think the characters are meant to be mysterious and alluring, if a little ridiculous, but not *primarily* ridiculous. If that makes sense. 

I’ll tell you, if you re-read that book as a cynical 40 something like I did, there’s a lot more eye rolling at all the pince-nez wearing & giving a shit about reading stuff in the original Greek than when I was 21. At least IME. ;)",zaneetashinn,2021-08-02T00:22:50Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,1
ow35ga_2,ow35ga,"Sometimes what is obvious to me is not obvious to everyone else. She is mocking Bunny. New money with audacity that is sacrificed in favor of the elite mind. It is obvious that she views the classical mind as superior to the modern. She even mentions this when Richard is in his second meeting with Julian. Remarking that the modern mind meanders onto tangents while the classical mind is decisive. This discipline of the mind is attained through taking on seriously and communing with the minds of antiquity. Taking the pursuit and study of the ancients seriously not simply dancing around the edges as Bunny has done. Bunny didn’t take it seriously so he was left behind. He was unable to transcend his nature. 

She even has a clear disdain for Protestantism. Charles and Camilla are Catholics and Julian explains why later on when he touches on Dante and Milton. Any serious reader will come to this conclusion on their own long before they ever read this book. Protestantism is the beginning of the end for the classical mind. It is new and audacious. It is rife with bigotry and unawareness of its own hypocrisy. Biting, sexist, concerned with money, deficient in its ability to read its own scriptures. (Dyslexia where you read the words but they don’t make sense to you or are out of order.)

Bunny picks up where Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer left off. If Tom represents the character traits found within emerging capitalism in the old American South. Bunny is what capitalism has grown into in all of its over exaggerated glory. Exaggerated bigotry employed by both Twain and Tartt expertly. While Catholicism was built out of the Roman mind and the classical reverence for esoteric wisdom. She consistently mentions Bunny’s dislike for Catholics and Jews both of which predate Protestantism. It is obvious that this is a very cathartic book for the author. What makes the book hard to put down is that she is unflinching in her judgments. The only way to see her commentary properly is to hold many of these same views yourself. Long before you ever pick up her book. There is only one path and it is The Secret History, Shakespeare, Milton, Plato etc.. You think your politicians and leaders spend their free time watching tv or sitting in church pews? No, they are classically trained minds and they are as committed to preserving the wisdom of antiquity as a late night bacchanal.",,2022-04-23T04:41:23Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,2

But there hasn't been a big payoff in my experience (I also read the Goldfinch). Somehow, despite lack of big twist or major realizations I still look back fondly on her books.

g4sesv_3,g4sesv,"I wouldn't advise reading anything else of hers. *The Secret History* is the only thing she's written that's any good. But it is pretty fabulous. I think the intrigue between the characters drives a lot of my interest, as well as the feeling that they're all kind of hurtling along a trajectory that none of them can understand or control. Also the idea of a clandestine class of sophisticates gathering and indulging highbrow sensibilities is appealing to me.   
  
I can kind of see where you're coming from in saying that the characters don't seem to learn anything, but that just makes it all the more believable for me. My enjoyment isn't based on characters learning things.",Jacques_Plantir,2020-04-20T13:45:41Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,3
g4sesv_4,g4sesv,"I’d be happy to elaborate further.

In Henry’s death we also find the culmination of a second prevalent, Greek-inspired, motif in the novel, katharsis. Greek tragedy or drama were intended to have a, well, cathartic effect on the audience, allowing them to reach a sort of heightened state of mind. The actual tragedies in the novel have a similar effect. With each death, the characters are lifted further and further out of their fog of blasé, eventually becoming fully aware of the harsh truths of reality.

Then we have the setting. Or rather, the nature of the setting. The fact that our main gang studies classical literature has a huge impact on their world and so the novel. The text is packed with references and allusions to different classical works, with just a few post-classical pieces sprinkled in there. This is combined with an almost blatantly obvious disregard for any of the literature from the immediately preceding decades. By ignoring any sort of influence from writers like Garcia Marquez, Julian Barnes and Günter Grass, Donna Tartt creates this sort of microcosm of temporal limbo, dictated by a period between Homer and Sylvia Plath.

(Wow that went pretentious... But I have a point! Bear with me.)

From the clues we’re given, it’s pretty safe to say the novel takes place in the late 1900s, and these clues give us this delightful contrast between the modern but flighty, and the ancient but ever lasting. These are reminders of the world beyond that of the main characters, and serve the EXACT same function as many of the similes in the Iliad, that remind the reader of the world beyond the battlefield at Troy, the world that the characters have left behind.

One final thing that I probably should’ve mentioned in my earlier comment is the theme of trying and failing to transcend ones own humanity. This is something that occurs again and again in classical literature, and always ends in being smote by the Gods or something. It even happens in the Bible, with the Tower of Babel. The whole purpose of the gang’s ventures into the forest is to try to achieve that Dionysian transcendence, but of course it ends in tragedy. 

So yeah. That’s my overlong take on The Secret History and also why I love it so so much. I hope this can help you enjoy it even more.",ensambarn,2020-04-22T15:42:04Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,4
s3nczu_1,s3nczu,"Based on what I know of The Secret History (which I read 100 pages of and DNFed), I'm fairly certain Tartt took heavy inspiration from Nathaniel Hawthorne's *The Marble Faun* (a book I also didn't like).",jefrye,2022-01-14T11:01:08Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,1
s3nczu_2,s3nczu,"The Secret History stands out, but a few other books occur to me as being similar enough that you might at least skim the descriptions online, check out some Goodreads posts, etc.

As I read The Secret History--which I did like very much--I couldn't help but notice that the writing seemed to call attention to itself at times. In recent years I've tended to prefer writing that's transparent, and that slips into the background. There are certainly exceptions. Anyway...

If you're looking for stories in which there is a mix of horror, mystery, and some connection to real or imagined ancient mysteries, a few books come to mind. I'll include ""genre"" books. To paraphrase Louis Armstrong: there are just two genres of fiction--good and bad.

**Aegypt** by John Crowley. Ancient mysteries: check. High quality writin': check. Characters who live and breathe in front of you: depends on the reader. Aegypt is the first in a series. Consider reading Crowley's standalone **Little, Big** first.

**The Anubis Gates** or **Declare** by Tim Powers. Powers writes ""secret history"" stories that are interwoven with historical events. His telling doesn't contradict known facts--it re-explains them. Very clever.

**The Library at Mount Char** by Scott Hawkins. Some folks might write this one off as ""just"" genre fiction of some kind. The writing works for the story, but you wouldn't necessarily roll the sentences around on your tongue all afternoon. But if you don't mind an uptick in horror relative to The Secret History, and the arcane cranked up to 11, then you might like this book. I almost left it off the list as unlikely to meet all your criteria, but no worries if it doesn't interest you.

**Blood Meridian** by Cormac McCarthy. Prose? It sure isn't comfort food, but WOW. If you enjoy spare writing, McCarthy's one to check out. Plot? Not even going to try to summarize. Characters? He's fathered more than a few memorable ones. How we can paint so much with so few words is a wonder.

To me, it doesn't matter whether they meet again or how they relate to one another later. Whoever they meet next, whether they stay together or not, the basic story will be the same: brokenness. To be sure, Camilla and Richard could meet again and start a love affair, or we could follow either of them across another story. What that would reveal about their character would be the same as what The Secret History revealed. You can imagine it, you can read it, but to what end?

Like for example we meet them and get to knew their ideology, philosophy, and how they manifest them in real life. Also we have a sense of their comings and goings; their interactions that paint them in more vivid colors than narration of from cradle to the grave. So what happens for me after the secret history is not really that important because what did happen that’s what I always get back to and think about. I think the fire went out of the surviving group members; their future selves won’t be a huge part of each other’s life.

As the plot unravels and their personality differences become more apparent they lose their united front. Near the end of the book a minor character comments that for twins they don't look much alike at all."" This could be another way Donna Tartt is showing how Richard idealizes them and makes them conform to his expectations but by the end he realizes he was wrong as everyone's facade crumbles.

Edit: Ooh, I also continued reading about secret history and apparently mainly people interpret Richard as a closet bisexual/homosexual and as one reviewer said, ""Richard is attracted to Camilla's ""boyishness"" as well.

3l8pwb_1,3l8pwb,"I liked this book. I read it in college and found myself relating to the narrator not because of his situation but of his desire to enter a world where only a few may see.

I've mentioned this in another thread but before reading this book, I had not long ago read Brideshead Revisited which I think shares a great deal of themes and elements with The Secret History. For example; issues regarding the odd nature of catholicism. Bunny died because of many things: one being his poor taste in attacks with which one of the twins (i think) countered with ""protestants are social climbers"" -- which was a description of Charles Ryder's situation when he befriended Sebastian Flyte. He was mooching off of Sebastian. In the same vein, you could see that it reflects the same deal of shock for both Richard and Charles Ryder when they entered into this odd world of the rich and the obscure.

The narrators describe their, according to Charles, profane memories in a very nostalgic and nauseatingly sweet manner. Funny enough, Waugh has since written a form of apology and self deprecating introduction for his book describing his disgust of nostalgia and the glorification of decadence (which is funny because Richard does the same at the start for his stay in college and for the murder).

Both books have overtones of religious nature to it in my opinion. The one being about the desire for a paganistic lifestyle and the other, well, an actual practice of free spirit and roaming. Both of which doesnt reflect the catholic lifestyle. Both end under the operation of a divine force, which was what Waugh said about Brideshead. Surprisingly enough, the sinners are all punished and everything goes down the drain for all of them. Both books. If by divine operation, Waugh meant strict justice and karma then I agree. All the false glamour of money and materialism fell down.

In Brideshead, a most interesting thing that always crops up in conversations about it is the ambiguous nature of Sebastian and Charles' relationship, which I could also say about Richard and Charles Macaulay (hey remember when he forgets everytime he has sex with Francis?). Both Richard Papen and Charles Ryder have ambiguous relationships with not so ambiguously bisexual alcoholic guys who both look so like their respective sisters, sisters who happen to also have a weird relationship with said alcoholic brothers, and sisters who happen to have had both an unfaithful relationship and ends up somewhat attracted to the narrators of their respective stories. We've come full circle.

Both books can portray a mood so accurately, too. I could feel the agony and suffering seething from the pages after the death of bunny and I remember thinking ""when is this all going to end?"" Yet i loved reading every page.

Definitely liked The Goldfinch more, I was sucked into that one entirely-- holed up in my room without sleep until I finished it. I didn't have trouble taking long breaks from the Secret History though. 

Not sure how I felt about it. I was underwhelmed by the reliance on class to differentiate between Richard and the others, and felt his infatuation with Camilla was unfounded, though I like /u/internetonsetadd 's definition of her as ""nymph-like,"" a quality I hadn't previously considered. However, as Camilla was one of the few female characters (other than the annoying flatmate- Judy?), I was irritated with her lack of agency. I thought the feminine voice was missing from the story. 

I found Julian to be a pompous ass the entire story, and didn't relate to the connection every character felt with him. 

I suppose overall, I felt disconnected from all the characters- there wasn't anyone I felt strongly similar to or that I found myself rooting for. However, the plot kept me engaged and driven.

3gi39r_2,3gi39r,"I finished The Secret History last month after letting it collect dust on my shelf for almost ten years.  I loved it, and I was kicking myself for not picking it up sooner.  

I won't pretend to have even a basic knowledge of Greek mythology, but I think the characters, their motivations and actions can all be understood to exist within an [Apollonian-Dionysian dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_and_Dionysian).  

Julian props up an Apollonian framework (self-satisfied reason and logic) within which his select group of mostly privileged, arrogant students are able to establish a scholarly, elitist identity, and guiltlessly rationalize their egoistic actions.

Richard yearns to escape his family/class background, and throughout much of the book he seeks to gain acceptance inside Julian's inner sanctum, buying into the facade, helping the group struggle against Dionysian forces (Bunny, and later Charles), always assuming that if he applies reason and logic to unraveling the group's secrets, there will be something reasonable and logical to discover, especially with regard to Henry's role as philosopher-mastermind.  

This, of course, isn't the case.  The group, its secrets and the emotional state of its members are heavily stressed by actual applications of logic, namely law enforcement.  By the end, it's revealed that early on Henry was seduced by Dionysian impulses, and that much of the behavior Richard assumed to be carefully plotted and rational was in fact chaotic and emotional.  And Julian's Apollonian framework just kind of evaporates.

Anyway, that's my cursory take.  I'd be interested to know what people think of Camilla and her role.  She struck me as being very nymph-like, but I'm not sure what mythological significance that has to how she related to and influenced the other characters.  I also feel like there might be some overall commentary on Generation X, but I don't quite have words for it.",internetonsetadd,2015-08-10T22:21:14Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,2

Tartt was likely inspired by the classics you named and more but she didn't use them in a particularly overt way in this novel; that's just part of a liberal arts education. *The Secret History* has its own unique combination of elements which make it a modern classic.",nickelundertone,2022-03-30T21:31:52Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,1

8jrzon_1,8jrzon,"The Secret History is my favourite Tartt book!
I love how it’s a murder mystery which tells you who dies and who kills them on the first page, yet can still be incredibly compelling. Grew to love all the characters, even when I hated them. The protagonist is a bit vacant though. 

I am pretty certain it was Henry who killed the farmer, but cannot fully remember. At least I think it works best if the group did go fully savage. The entire book is about faking til you make it, the protagonist pretends to be like the Classics group and so fits in, while the Classics group pretend to be a cult until they genuinely become one. 


Bunny was an arse but probably the most human character, I found him very interesting and even more so with the knowledge of what would happen to him. The ending also deserves praise, it’s pretty abstract but works so well to show that after everything that happens - all the pretentiousness and lies - maybe, just maybe, the world they wanted to live in came true.


The Goldfinch also is great, very Dickensian while being contemporary America, if a little too long. The Secret Friend is a solid book, very detailed and thematically juicy, but not as exciting or memorable as the others.

Regarding Bunny, he was so obnoxious it was hilariously funny. But you know, that never really warrants murder... 

Man, I loved The Secret History. Though I got sucked into the pretentious literary part of Tumblr and that took a lot of the fun out of it... I mean, I did start out adoring the pretentiousness and the aesthetic, but at some point I realized that it was *so* white and eurocentric. However, during my last reread, I *finally* noticed that it was very likely satire and the book blew me away a second time. Read it with this lens on and it will definitely enrich your reading experience.

I love Donna Tartt full stop. You might enjoy The Goldfinch more since it has pretty similar themes. I never got around to finishing The Little Friend because I lost my copy, but I remember being similarly fascinated. The Goldfinch, meanwhile, topped the Secret History for me.

1krxqd_1,1krxqd,"I've read The Secret History a few times, and the second half is definitely slower than the first. I think it's because the climax of the novel really, is Bunny's death, and because you know this is going to happen you want to know how and why, so you have this anticipation and build up to it, whereas the second half is exploring the consequences for each of the other characters.

That being said, for me second half isn't any less enjoyable, even though it slows down I think it's interesting how each character deals with his/her actions in a different way. They all begin to crack at different points, and I think it's fascinating reading to see how far they are going to fall, and how much they change. I also think it's interesting how of all of them, it seems to affect Richard the least, it was only on a re-read that I realised he really isn't the most likeable fellow, he's not even a particularly good person, but because we only have his point of view, his flaws aren't as obvious to the reader as the other's are.

I think the only part where it drags is when they are staying with Bunny's family, that whole section could have been condensed a little. I really love it how Henry's character is reminiscent of a Greek tragedy, it's such a fitting ending to a great story. I do think it's worth a re-read, there are little things you'll notice that you missed the first time which I think will add to your enjoyment of the novel.",FatPinkMast,2013-08-21T04:55:29Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,1

Back in the fall of 1990 I started grad school and I didn't have a TV. I only listened to the radio. But I decided to get one magazine to keep me in the loop about social and entertainment issues. That magazine was *Vanity Fair*. Boy was I happy. I got to see Demi Moore painted! But they also had really good reviews of books and talks with authors. One such review was Donna Tartt's *The Secret History*. They even ran a small part of the book in the issue. I was so enthralled. It was part of the beginning of the book and I really enjoyed it. I had just graduated college in 1990 and was still in school so I was going through a sort of *Heathers/Big Chill/Less Than Zero* phase. I wanted to read it so bad. But I never did. My school work picked up and then I ended up forgetting about it until about 5 years ago. I went and got it from my library and really was looking forward to enjoying this book now.

I really enjoyed the first part. I went to school in Amherst MA which is near VT and Bennington College (which is what this whole thing is modeled on.) I loved being taken back too that time in the 80s. Then things started to change for me in the book. The part that really made me go '*ok just get through this and it will get better*' was the part about winter session and the elements (I don't want to give out spoilers.) then it just got kind of hohum. 

I felt kind of jipped. I wanted to find the article in *Vanity Fair* and tell the author how I felt. But since I took so long to read it I just moved on.  It was a really good premise and a good first part. I just believe she could not keep it moving and me happy. It was her first book so I just let it go.

Did you know she recieved $450,000 in advance for the book, and it was her first novel!

You know I wish I could go to the library and look through old *Vanity Fairs*. I bet there were more good books out there that I missed.

152m624_1,152m624,"There's a lot of description in The Secret History, and it is already being considered a modern classic, so (while less social media use would probably be good for a lot of us) I don't think it's really your attention span.

On here people often encourage dropping anything with any literary value the second you're not enjoying it (really because they aren't wiling to read anything like that, fullstop)...but you're not actually obligated to enjoy every second. Think about what else you're getting out of it, learn to appreciate by learning more about how the writing works (simply reading helps develop the ability to analyse a text, but it is also a skill to actively learn, look into close reading), just accept being ambivalent sometimes or that it doesn't matter if you end up remembering a section as 'the boring bit'. If you understand the writing well enough, you can think about why it didn't work as well, even (like the parliment scenes in Phineas Finn. The problem is it's too vague, possibly because Trollope, with his strong interest in real politics, didn't know how to handle a purely fictional government. It doesn't sufficiently depict either the detail of a real political issue or develop the characters of many of the fictional politicians. He improved on it later by focusing more on the characterisation).

Either way it's not the choice some will want to make it between reading good writing or only reading for mindless entertainment. You can keep reading modern literary fiction and try some relatively more recent classics.

As a wild card recommendation, try The Likeness by Tana French. It's a Dublin murder mystery with dark academia vibes. It was incredibly gripping and I read it all in one go. That one might be up your alley as well.",caffeinatedlackey,2023-10-26T03:36:21Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,3

17gkrdm_7,17gkrdm,It's interesting because I finished it just today. I thought I was going to devour it but I took a couple of breaks (weeks) from reading. It's one of the books I've read where I had barely any highlights or notes. It's full of Shakespearean quotes and there wasn't much original good lines if it makes sense. It's probably a good choice that I read it first before the Secret History. I kinda already felt that it's better so I gave this one a shot because of the recos. I actually liked Dangerous Girls and We were liars than If we were villains. You're right that it's too predictable. The revelation was also barely a revelation.,maven-blood,2023-10-26T06:53:52Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,7
17gkrdm_8,17gkrdm,"I agree that We Were Villains has pretty one dimensional characters, but I wouldn't say it's predictable IMO. But The Secret History is one of the best books I've ever read, and the prose is stellar, so I didn't expect If We Were Villains to come close.

You're comparing a popcorn book to literary fiction. If We Were Villains is the younger, dumber cousin.

The Likeness by Tana French proves to be better written, ans in the same vein, but again TSH is just unmatched. I'd recommend you pick up some backlist Margaret Atwood to scratch that itch. Surfacing was *amazing* and packs so much to examine in a neat 250 pages.

17gkrdm_10,17gkrdm,"AMEN. The only book I’ve DNF-ed twice, and I will battle my way through just about anything.

I was waiting in line for free tickets to Shakespeare in the Park back in 2017 and they were giving away copies. I took one, attempted to read it, thought it was trash, and put it on the bottom of my bookshelf. 

This year I saw it popping up all over BookTok, and not just with the Colleen Hoover and Taylor Jenkins Reid crowd. I recently read The Secret History and found it pretty middle of the road: bloated in the first half, but fairly compelling as the plot began to pick up. My sister read If We Were Villains, and gave it five stars, so when I was looking to pad my GoodReads reading challenge a bit, I gave it another shot. Oi. 

The prose is awful. It reads like the worst fan fiction. The characters aren’t even wooden, they’re more like wet cardboard. The depiction of a conservatory theatre program is vague and poorly drawn, and the Shakespeare quotes had me groaning every other line. Rio didn’t even attempt to write human characters. No one would behave as they do, they wouldn’t speak as they do, etc. Awful awful awful excuse for a novel, not worth finishing. I could go on and on and on.

17gkrdm_14,17gkrdm,"Coincidentally this is the book that I’m currently reading and plan to finish tonight, so I’m going to avoid reading the full post until after in order to avoid spoilers, but to respond to the headline:

I read The Secret History earlier this month, which is very similar to If We Were Villains, and I have to say I’m enjoying Villains SO much more. 

I do have some issues with it (Richard seemed to go from friendly to downright abusive in the matter of pages with very little explanation as to why beyond being unhappy with the casting, and the characters constantly dropping Shakespeare quotes in the middle of normal conversations seems very unrealistic). Buy beyond that, I think the pacing is pretty good, and the time jumps keep me interested in hearing Oliver’s version of events, even though it’s clear he may be an unreliable narrator. 

That said, my feelings on the book may be skewed because I’m reading it nearly back-to-back with The Secret History and it’s impossible NOT to compare the two, but overall I’m enjoying If We Were Villains…curious to see if my opinion changes once I reach the final two acts in the book.

EDIT: I finished If We We’re Villains 20 minutes ago and have decided that I strongly prefer it over The Secret History.

17gkrdm_21,17gkrdm,"I definitely do not agree! (part 1)

\-TSH and IFWV are completely different books, which have been likened mostly for marketing reasons. TSH is a satirical book about obsession and about using knwoledge as a way of creating harsher class divisions, it's really more about *class* . IFWV is a tragedy in the teather sense, which means that from the beginning you know what happens but the outcomes can't be changed, and it's about *identity*.

In TSH the characters want to kill Bunny for relatively stupid reasons, they convince themselves it's necessary, they want to do it, and nobody pays for it because they're rich priviledges white kids - the real twist of the book would have been them going to jail. Their lives fall apart because they *make* them fall apart, not especially because they feel guilty about killing Bunny- they don't give a damn, they're too self-centered for that. In IFWV James did not want to kill Richard, none of them wanted to see him dead, even though he's not only extremely unlikable but straight up violent and dangerous. The murder is an  accident, one of them ends up paying for it and everyone's lives crumble, because of this awful thing that happened.

As for the setting yes,it's the same. But like, The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye are both set in New Jork, doesn't mean anything.

\- Saying Shakespeare should be listed as co-author just because of the quotes and scenes they enact is like saying that Homer should be listed as co-author for The Song of Achilles. Be for real, just because they're actig out scenes doesn't mean that the *meaning* and *context* of the scenes is the same. The interesting thing about this book is actually to see how the personal lives of the actors bleed into the Shakespearian scenes they are portraying. The author didn't add them to show you she knows her Shakespear any more than Madeline Miller followed the story of the Iliad in TSOA to show you she knows Homer. Also yeah, the characters quote Shakespeare in every other sentence because they're annoying obsessed theater kids! They live and breathe Shakespeare, their school is slightly cultu-ish about it too, and I don't know if you've ever hung out with theater kids but I tell you, if a musical theater cast irl went through what these characters did, they would 100% be *singing* lines from Hamilton and Les Mis. It's just slightly amped up for literary purposes. And right at the beginning, when the MC is talking to the the cop we realize that everyone outside of their context thinks that what they do is cringe too. And to be fair, *in the Secret History people talk in Ancient Greek that's cringe as Hell* (not to mention unlikely? but I won't get into that) and icon queen boss bitch Judy Poovey makes it clear.

\-The book isn't male gazey, you're just experiencing the POV of the *male MC*, who not only is attracted to Meredith but also spends most of the book trying to convince himself that yeah no he's totally attracted only to Meredith because she's a female woman with breasts and soft lips and totally not attracted to his male roommate. We know she's not only that, and part of her conflict in the story is the fact that everyone seems to see her that way, and she herself had taken the habit of presenting herself as the femme fatale because that's the role that she has been assigned. But I'll come back to that. Also by these standards TSH should be male gazey too - shall we talk about how Richard sees Camilla? Talk about one dimentional. It's part of having a first person narrator, we see characters the way the narrator does.

\-IFWV is a tragedy, and there are no big revelations in tragedies. That's not what tragedies are for: tragedies are stories that begin when characters are relatively happy and then it ends in pain and suffering for all. What you're probably thinking about are dramas, aka stories when the characters are not so happy in the beginning, they encounter obstacles and suffering throughout the story, but eventually it all ends well. Most Ancient Greek plays are tragedies, same goes for Shakespeare. So what's the point of tragedies, then? To quote Hadestown (and be the annoying theater kid): *""To know how it ends/And still begin to sing it again/As if it might turn out this time"".* Which is why we still keep retelling Greek Myths over and over again. ML Rio  did the same with a Shakespearean play and not with a Greek myth. The tragedy of this book (which is what happens in every tragedy anyway) is that if the characters had all made different choices, if they had communicated better, then none of that would have happened. You're supposed to know that the two male leads have romantic feelings for one another, because part of the tragedy is you yelling at the book ""you dumb idiots why don't you just talk, so none of this would happen?"".

Also we should stop yelling ""queerbaiting!"" each time stories don't specifically state charaters' sexual orientations and don't explore same sex relationships in a physical way - especially when their inability to cope with their feelings for one another is what causes their downfall. Good representation isn't just representation à la Heartstopper, *this* is also pretty good representation. God knows if any queer person I know hasn't had an ambiguous relationship with a close friend while they were figuring themselves out. And for that matter, TSH does the same with Richard and what's his name, the tall twink, Francis.",Avocado-Toast9,2023-10-27T10:18:03Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,21

Tartt’s descriptions of excessive drinking made me feel literally sick to my stomach (which, one could say, is a compliment to her writing). 

I’ve found a common criticism of Goldfinch to be Theo’s lack of deliberate action: life happens to him rather than he creating a life for himself. I loved this aspect of Theo's character. To me, it made him seem much more human. I felt his character was well-developed. Boris and Mrs. Barbour were beautifully developed as well. And I don't know if I have loved a character as much as I loved Hobie.

I read the final 200 pages in one sitting. Generally, I think the events in the novel took place as the reader hoped they would. This left me satisfied but slightly unmoved? I am curious if anyone else experienced this.

gk6vlf_7,gk6vlf,"I'm writing this 16 days after this post was made but figure I'll contribute anyway.

I've come to love this book. I listened to the audiobook and it was treacherous. It was like 35 hours long and Tartt's writing is so detailed and sometimes meandering. I almost dropped it halfway through because there were so many parts where the most mundane things were described in the most detailed way. I remember it was a part where the characters were shopping for plateware or something and I just couldn't get through it. I'm glad I did, I think the characters are really thought out and complex, probably more so than any book I've ever read. For me, the magic of Tartt's writing is what is not explicitly said on the page but rather implied in such nuance. You can grasp things about the characters, their pasts, and what has happened to them during the time jumps without explicitly telling you about it. And Tartt perfected that in the Secret History. Some people don't like the direction she took the book in the last 3rd but I really enjoyed the utter despair and all the twists and turns. This book and The Secret History are interesting in that the main characters are pretty similar and kinda bland, but the supporting characters are so colorful and interesting.

The movie adaptation is good if you're not looking at it as the end all be all adaptation because it doesn't do the book justice at all. However, the film is beautifully shot by the master Roger Deakins and it is fun to see some of the locations and characters brought to life in certain scenes. I thought the film was well casted but the book is really quite expansive and just didn't work in the way they did it.",newaccforgotpass,2020-06-01T02:29:37Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,7

9jk8ef_1,9jk8ef,"The Goldfinch is probably my favourite book of all time. It's the only contemporary novel I've read that gave me the same feeling as Dickens, Tolstoy etc. did when I was younger: relishing in language, beauty, taking its time. I loved living with Theo, if you know what I mean. 

It's very in vogue now to write short, minimalist sentences, and imply everything, and have a bunch of soulless clever characters, but I get tired of that so quickly. The Goldfinch was as rich and satisfying as a chocolate cake.


And it's funny -- I always thought the Secret History was a more compelling read, a page-turner, and that the Goldfinch was more complicatedly good. It was a more literary novel, I think, which is why I wish they weren't making a damn movie out of it. The Secret History, on the other hand, would make an excellent film, but alas.


Anyway, just blabbering because Tartt is, to me at least, the greatest living author we have. Her writing is magical. I can't count how many people I've recommended her to.

I haven't read The Little Friend, but in both The Goldfinch and The Secret History, Tartt's main characters are aimless and lack agency. The entire plot of both books is a character with no particular gifts, direction, or even moral value drifting along in the wake of more active characters. Boris is absolutely a brilliant character, because he is 100% of the action of the book. The prose is beautiful. But the plot is just so lacking, and the character is a hollow shell. So while I admire some of its virtues, I just don't like it as a book. ",TinaFrance,2018-09-28T15:00:24Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,The Secret History,2

13e9m1t_1,13e9m1t,"love the orwell quote.   my problem with the golfdinch is that her talent is bigger than her ideas in this one.  the secret history was far more taut.  

I agree with you that the plot is ... well, not hardly there.  it's more like a wire that's just there for her to string her descriptive baubles on.  and it had holes that really *annoyed* me.  an underage kid is at ground zero of a terrorist bomb, is *known* to have been there, and he just dusts himself off and is allowed to just saunter home with a masterpiece under one arm? and then proceed through the next several months with practically no formal intervention or followup?  bullshit.  even in whatever era she set this book in, just really bs.  but ""we"" need Theo to be tragic and nihilist for many hundreds of pages, so bs it is.  

I did really like the atmosphere and suppressed desolation of the middle part.  that was really finely observed.  makes the previous x-hundred pages all the more irritating. 

 Boris is adorable, but he's a caricature.  

Hobie ... well, I typed Hagred at first, so that's who I think he's a blatant ripoff of.  

we get so little about Pippa because she's only there to service the theoesque theme.

It is written as well as the Secret History, but I like the characters more: what an interesting character is Harriet, the almost-teenage weirdo tomboy growing up in snake-infested Mississippi! And Danny's family... And everybody else... Such a gallery of interesting people! For me, Donna Tartt could just talk about their daily life without anything substantial happening, and I just would go on and on and on listening to her for thousands and thousands of pages without ever getting bored.

The characters are well-defined, psychologically realistic. I am sorry, but in all honestly they interest me much more than rich college kids studying Greek. How would these characters act given their history, their environment, their circumstances? I want to see, I want to know what's gonna happen. Here lies the interest of the book.

I have always had a weak spot for stories that often feel like kid adventure books, mixed up with more serious, scary, adult things, and here there is plenty.

I’m a little bit over page 150 and wonder if it would have made a difference had it been released eg one part per year. Would readers have stayed loyal over the time & have awaited the next part in full anticipation?  
Hardcore fans, maybe. I believe, Murakami did so with his 1Q84.  

How you describe the various topics it touches, art and life etc. I like that. Very often, it’s the form how these are presented, and I’m not talking about language here. I admit that books like The Secret History, Confessions, Perfect Days, .. are easier to read in the sense of: the author has done all the work for you, prepared a framework and tada! a nicely-structured outcome, or message for the reader.  

Two books,  
where it was the language which had me utterly, fascinated were Andrés Barba’s “Such Small Hands” (it’s excellent, absolutely recommended) and the very modern and Zeitgeist novel “The Pisces” by Melissa Broder (also, great - but definitely, for female audience). In both cases, I couldn’t care less about how long the story would continue, it was the language as such, which worked so well with me.  

I will continue reading the Bolaño because all the comments to this post give me the impression that this book, is worth spending the time with. It requires a different openness, though. You can’t approach it as you would the average modern novel.
