Mark Winegardner wrote two GF books and Edward Falco wrote The Family Corleone, which is the best of the novels not written by Puzo.",Kane76,2022-10-31T14:55:22Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,1

yidfzz_3,yidfzz,"I would not recommend reading any more of Puzo’s work. The second book, The Sicilian, is not the plot of The Godfather II, it is a weird story of Michael stopping over in some random Sicilian town where a smuggler becomes a revolutionary and it is fuckin teeeeeerrible. 

Authors and critics have remarked on how good The Godfather is when compared to how bad the rest of Puzo’s writing is.

>	The Last Don is Domenico Clericuzio, a wise and ruthless old man who is determined to see his heirs established in legitimate society but whose vision is threatened when secrets from the family's past spark a vicious war between two blood cousins.

>	The Last Don is a mesmerizing tale that takes us inside the equally corrupt worlds of the mob, the movie industry, and the casinos where beautiful actresses and ruthless hitmen are ruled by lust and violence, where sleazy producers and greedy studio heads are drunk on power, where crooked cops and desperate gamblers play dangerous games of betrayal, and where one man controls them all.",DoctorStrawberry,2022-10-31T21:45:25Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,10

As the story goes, Robert Evans of paramount pictures optioned the book before puzo had written a single word. Once the book was done, it was a giant success. Since paramount paid next to nothing for the option to make the book into the movie, they were able to retain an unheard of 80 profit points which made the film insanely profitable. All because Robert Evans saw something in puzos idea. I reread the book this year, along with another book called leave the gun take the canoli and the godfather annotated screenplay. All of these really compliment each other if you would like to do a deep dive. Buy yeah godfather by puzo is classic.

yidfzz_15,yidfzz,"I read the book many, many years ago and I thought it was trash.  I'm saying that in the most endearing way.  It's one of those books you take to the beach or read on a long bus trip, ""a pretty smooth ride"" to quote you.  I saw it after the movie and while I did appreciate Fontaine being given a more central role in the book, I'm glad the movie excised most of it.  I just find it amazing how a book like that, again, nothing against it, it's great for what it is, but it's just an easy to read pulp-type novel, become arguably the greatest film ever made.

PS BTW, when you say you'll read the entire trilogy, The Godfather only has one true novel.  The sequels were based on original screenplays written by Coppola and Puzo.

Things about Sollozzo that never made much sense, or weren’t as well-explained.  I think that’s just a feature of filmmaking from that era: the audience is expected to know things that maybe later audiences no longer know.

The book does a great job of laying out some of those little details, plot points that were present in the book, but probably cut from the movie.  Sollozzo and his desire to get into the drug game.  Johnny Fontaine and his struggles in Hollywood.  Even Tessio’s betrayal.

Yeah it was such a horny book.

Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli is a fantastic book about the writing of The Godfather and then the making of the movie.

Puzo *knew* he was making a horny book. To over simplify things a bit, he had always said he could write a hit whenever he wanted but he would rather make art, write the great american novel - that sort of thing. He tries this, is not particularly successful, and then his family giving him shit about claiming to be able to write a hit combined with some bottoming out due to a lifetime gambling addiction, he says ""fuck it, I'll write a popular book.""

He did tons of research, but the relevant part is that he outlined ahead of time how many sex scenes he wanted to have to keep people interested/attentive, mapping out who would fuck who and when as part of the early writing stages of the book.

yidfzz_33,yidfzz,"Oh, are we talking about the heroic abortionist, Jules Segal? He's such a weird, Mary Sue-style character--he not only diagnoses Lucy Mancini, he diagnoses the growth on Johnny Fontaine's vocal cords just by hearing him talk, and recommends the plastic surgeon who fixes Michael's face. For a small part of the book, he completely takes over the story, and there's half a mind that you could do an adaptation of The Godfather where the brilliant young surgeon who gets peripherally involved with the mob is the main character, and the Corleones and everyone else are mostly in the background while Jules struts around Vegas, being brilliant, solving medical mysteries, and winning Lucy's hand (and surgically-repaired other parts).

But in the larger scheme of things, he's mainly there to deliver a medical PSA about the benefits of vaginal surgery. And I always wonder who it was in Puzo's life who had a pelvic floor issue, and it was surgically corrected, leaving Puzo so enthusiastic about the prospect that he vowed ""In my next book, I'm going to tell the world about this!

I’ve never read the book, but in Goodfellas, the story of the Bamboo Lounge always seemed to me to be in conversation with Bonasera’s story. It’s everything that Bonasera fears in the book: when a mobster does you a favor, he becomes your business partner, then he uses your business in the commission of his crimes, and runs up debts on the business’s credit.

b7f9k2_3,b7f9k2,"I read it when it first came out, and I was much too young to appreciate it as a novel then.  Turned out I also lived in a Southern Ontario town where all of the big mafioso came to retire- growing up I remember huge ""state"" funerals stretching for blocks in our city, complete with people writing down license plates. Except that I was friends with those people's grandkids, and spent more than a few holidays celebrating very large ""family"" gatherings with them. 

It's hard to explain to younger people how terrifying ""the Mafia"" was to those of us who grew up in North America in the late 60s/70s.  Our high school was closed for 3 days because a 'retired' mafia guy died doing laps on our track. 

Now reading the Godfather seems very nostalgic to me- I can't even watch the movie because I find Marlon Brando hilarious instead of menacing.  Too many impersonations of him on early SNLs I think. 

If you're interested in a ""later"" version of the Mafioso, I'd recommend watching [OZ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118421/).  It's about prison culture in the early 90s, when the Sicilian Mafia were still hanging on. ",doesnteatpickles,2019-03-30T23:17:28Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,3

b7f9k2_12,b7f9k2,"quiet the opposite experience for me. i am reading it at the moment, on p 470, and can't wait to be done. first I was disappointed because for some reason I was expecting literature but this is more ""pop trash"". second I am positively annoyed and don't get the authors obsession with that singers vocal chords and that girls vagina - didn't anyone else find themselves wondering why they read pages and pages about that bizarre medical nonsense and that boring ""filling material"" about people whose life i couldn't care less about? Also, I am surprised that Coppola was so interested in the book. I read Heart of Darkness, which is tasty and rich, and I get his obsession in the apocalypse. But the godfather is nowhere near. I do like the godfather movie though, his adaptation is great, very close to the text as if he didnt dare to change anything, awstruck, but so much less trashy, much more elevated and artful.

Came here also to say that while reading the meeting of the Dons, after the death of one of the characters (dont want to spoil), I noticed that the iconic image of the puppeteers hand and the strings has a second meaning. the obvious one is that it's the Dons hand pulling the strings, but Puzo repeatedly describes how normal society is sheepish and bows to authority, he even says if I remember correctly, that the dons are ""real men"" and have cut themselves loose. they refuse to bow to authority and take their lifes into their own hands and so they are the ones who have freed themselves from the control of the legal government and ""we"" are the ones being pulled by the strings of the government.

Keep in mind that Sicily in the early 20th century didn’t really have laws or a police force the way we do. If you wanted any kind of justice done, you’d have to make nice with the local crime boss. 

In The Godfather their violence is mostly directed at other mafiosi corrupt cops or crooked rich people. Women, kids and poor people are rarely people victimized by their violence.

One thing I noticed in the book is how the Corleones are the least evil people in the series.

You have Johnny Fontane who left his wife and kids to take up with a floozy screen actress who he domesticlely absuses.

You have Jack Woltz the famous Hollywood  director who has the horses head thrust in his bed.  In the book a mother takes her 13 year old daughter to trade sex for a part in a film, and he is mentioned to have “ made stars” of numerous actresses in that way.

How did you come to write The Godfather?
I wrote it to make money. The editors didn’t like the idea behind my next novel. It sounded like another loser. One editor wistfully remarked that if Fortunate Pilgrim had only had a little more of that Mafia stuff in it maybe the book would have made money. (One of the minor characters was a mob chief.) I was forty-five years old and I owed $20,000 to relatives, finance companies, banks and assorted bookmakers and shylocks. It was really time to grow up and sell out as Lenny Bruce once advised. So I told my editors OK, I’ll write a book about the Mafia.

I suspect the prodigious private parts plot plan was to add sex to the novel, as the only other sex I can remember was Michael's wedding night with Apalonia (sp?)....and a strange sex party Johnny takes Bruno to.

He created an incredible tale that exploded into this pop culture imagination/fantasy of what the mafia was and is. People also don't understand what the mafia provided for Italian-Americans and others in the neighborhoods in which they lived - but people also don't understand that that was because they needed the people around them to tolerate their presence. It was definitely inspired by the actual NY mafia but Puzo also put a spin on the stereotypes given to Italian Americans at the time that was enough to turn them from ""dirty wop greasers"" into being ~cool~ and half of that is because of the movie interpretation (the perfect movie!!). But for more realistic work from Puzo, I highly recommend you read The Unfortunate Son, and for a better understanding of the Mafia in modern times, I recommend watching Suburra: Blood on Rome on Netflix (dramatized, but v juicy and honestly...having lived in Italy/Sicily I wouldn't be surprised if it was based on a true story).",fmp243,2021-03-06T01:27:32Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,1

As an actual Italian from Italy, I can assure you that organized crime has absolutely no redeeming qualities.

It is a definite fact that some people are criminals because they feel they have no choice. It is also an indisputable fact that some people are just pieces of unredeemable shit.  If you let the 'had no choice' people slide, youre going to end up letting the pieces of shit go.

Society can fail in the opposite direction of being to lenient and having to many forgiveness programs and saftey nets for those who would exploit them. Social saftey nets for those who fall into poverty or have to make hard choices are good, social saftey nets for those who have committed wrongs are fucking stupid in my experience.

You hit the nail on the head re: people being disappointed by institutions that are supposed to do right by them. So, naturally, they turn towards supposed self-made men who seem to contort the system to their whims. 

America, with all her faults and virtues, tends to pretend to be something it's not until it actually becomes said thing. The criminal element reflects the constant ebb and flow of societal mores, offering up that which is deemed unacceptable by respectable people (see the drug war, prostitution, gambling, etc). So gangsters - especially those who rise to positions of prominence - are the negative heartbeat of the collective zeitgeist. Of civilization and that which she openly tolerates and secretly desires. 

The Godfather is the story of the birth of modern America. Of the immigrants who came to these strange shores to make their own way, the vast majority doing what's right despite having to endure what's wrong, and the minority who are willing to trade their souls for a taste of power.

1. It retains the best moments of the book (the Sollozzo meeting, Michael's decision to get blood on his hands, the gathering of the Dons, Sonny's death).

2. It wisely discards the least interesting parts of the book (Lucy's surgery and her doctor boyfriend, Nino Valenti's Hollywood journey).

3. It turns good scenes in the book into all-time great cinematic scenes, through brilliant direction (Bonasera's first meeting with the Don, the baptism juxtaposed with the assassinations).",wickedwickedzoot,2023-11-30T02:44:05Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,1

Your comments and the ones below may be the litmus test as to whether this book is timeless or dated but I loved this book and feel the need to make it understood a bit more.

We didn't have the sheer volume of entertainment sources. We had 3 channels, a few books that we all shared and the radio. Movies cost us our pocket money but we went.

This book carried me through summer school in the 70's. The movie was in production, the fashion became a trend, we met Al Pacino and James Caan and we were all thrilled when we could pay homage to Brando.

The characters and subplots meant the book didn't finish quickly. We found layers inside and wondered about the relationships and way of life. For most of us, the sex scenes in a mainstream best seller were shockingly sexy and new. Romance and passion were not portrayed the way that Sonny took Lucy. It touched a primal cord in us.

The 70's also had just exploded with stories of the crime families and their way of life. Trusted capos were turning on their GodFather's and we were witnesses to history.

The 70's were gritty and hairy (I mean everywhere) and the GodFather spoke of that and we listened.",Taysmom39,2018-07-18T18:00:34Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,1

Words go in and out of fashion. There's some tool on google where you can type in a word and see how popular it was over time in all the books google has in its databases. And, I'm sure broad displays a curve like every other word. 

The book is also, what, fifty years old and so you're reading about a different time. It's also set before its written. 

Nothing says you have to like it, but you seem to be having deep emotional responses to how characters behaved and were treated, and if you are affected emotionally, it really can't be a bad book, otherwise you wouldn't have given a shit what happened to anyone. . .

I don't know if you ever watched the Sopranos. But in it, there's a scene where a mobster shoots a baker in the foot because the baker's giving the mobster shit and makes him wait in line.

These hoods aren't ""macho men"", they are cartoon parodies of ""macho men"", cheap, mostly illiterate gangsters who only understand that survival requires proving that you're meaner than the next guy and not to be trifled with. Those who rise above and actually control the underworld are the opposite - the godfather himself, who is calm, soft spoken and reasonable, or Sollozzo the Turk, who explains he's not a violent man, he just wants to do business. Or Michael Corleone, who has given up on his goombah family and become ""westernized"", only to fall back out of loyalty for his father.

9tyls6_8,9tyls6,">Even Don Corleone, and Michael, share that ""no woman will ever enter my world"" way of thinking.

Like I said, the books would be inauthentic if he'd changed that. Don Corleone was born in the 19th century, was married and had a family and was already making his fortune in war trafficking during WWI. Those were the times he lived in.

And Micheal doesn't feel that way at all, he finds a ""modern"" American woman rather than a traditional Italian wife, his views are very different. The part about ""not sharing"" doesn't follow from his opinions of women, but rather from that fact that he's decided to join his dad's criminal empire, but has enough of his previous ""western"" outlook that he wants to insulate his family from it. What can he say? Yeah, I know how I told you I have nothing to do with the family business, Kay, but I just ordered the hit on four mafia dons today, how about some dinner?

Of course he does a crappy job of it and manages to antagonize his wife, but that's because he's not a very pleasant man to begin with. He's capable of murdering his own brother and brother-in-law, he's pretty much a thug too, with a slightly thicker veneer of civilization.

>those soft spoken reasonable men, like Sollozzo, who wants to traffic in illegal narcotics, or Tattaglia, who bought and sold women, all these men -- they all only want to ""do business"", but their doing business includes dealing out harm and even death to a lot of people

Well, of course. They're criminals, their business is crime. The Godfather himself, for all his humility and soft speech had no trouble sticking knives in people or shooting them when he was young. And when he's old, he has other people do it for him. It's a book about the mafia, not about Apple or IBM.

My point was that being ""macho"" is a personality trait, not about being a criminal. It's Don Corleone's personality to be soft spoken, reasonable, humble. But he will happily put a knife in you if that's the only way to get what he wants. Contrast this with say Joe Pesci's character in *Goodfellas*. Both are criminals, but one is ""macho"" while the other is not.

Also, Tattaglia is not shown as being soft spoken at all. He doesn't have much dialog in the book, but he's shown as a weak old man who's used as a pawn by Don Barzini.",Valmyr5,2018-11-06T05:35:37Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,8

Right, in an exaggerated, cartoonish way, as I said, for the lower level hoods. But the godfather is not ""domineering"", ""fierce"" or display ""bravado"", he is the opposite, he is self-effacing. Puzo made a big deal out of that, it's an important part of the story. Sollozzo is also like that, he makes no threats, he is always trying to downplay his own importance.

I thought it worth pointing out that a blanket generalization of the book's characters as ""one dimensional macho men"" isn't fair, because the most important characters aren't like that at all.",Valmyr5,2018-11-06T05:52:28Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,9

If you read the book afterwards, it will flesh out some of what's in the movie, and you may find that enjoyable. But the movie absolutely stands on its own. ",mariox19,2011-09-04T16:07:08Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,1

k4cvd_3,k4cvd,"As with any other ""ground-breaking"" media, you are going to miss out on a major part of the Godfather experience because you've come to it too late. 

At the time they were written, Puzo's books were eye-opening, shocking depictions of something nobody had talked about before. The mafia was called the ""m word"" in the media; that's how secretive it was at the time. If you can put your mind into that place, you might get a feel for the impact of those books. It wasn't about Puzo's writing ability; it was about a story that we all suspected to be true but nobody actually wrote in detail about, or so successfully, before Puzo.

Then, think about the movies. There simply were no movies like this in existence. Now you can see the Godfather movie influence in TV shows, genre fiction, etc. You can't really go into a ""before Godfather movie"" state of mind. 

For me, reading the book first was the way to go. Now, I'm not sure it matters because our culture is drenched in the knowledge gained from both mediums. Either way, you're in for a fascinating story!

It's a far better book than The Godfather.  The Godfather is just strange.  It alternates between poor dialogue and the unsexiest sex scenes I've read.  If you like the movie then it's a great book because it's like a collection of long wikipedia articles about each character (including the backstory of a lot of characters who have only a handful of lines in the film), and so it makes watching the movie more enjoyable.

Two great examples...from two classics...so SPOLIERS...In the Godfather, there is the sub-plot of Sonny fooling around with Lucy Mancini, one of Connie's friends and bride-maids. Now, it is known in the novel and the movie that Sonny was the John Holmes of his day...so much so...that he actually ruined Lucy and she had to get it repaired. Now, Lucy is pretty much a throw-away character in the novel (but not in Godfather 3) that the author spends an entire chapter on her finding the right doctor to fix her. This sub-plot has nothing to do with anything in the movie (though we later learn that she gives birth to Sonny's boy, Vincent in Gdfthr 3), but Puzo includes it in the novel. Additionally, Sonny having a large one has nothing to do with anything, but Puzo includes it, and thankfully, it is not including in the movie.

2 The Hunt for Red October. Clancy spends an enormous amount of time on all of these extra ships and others and sub-plots that has nothing to do with the plot, but is thankfully excised in the movie.

Now, I know movies have to leave out some sub-plots and create composite characters, but for the life of me, I wondering why the editors left all of this stuff in...especially with authors who were starting their careers that they were pretty much editors' whipping boys.

1ramwo_1,1ramwo,"I think it's sort of like, watching the Godfather or other pieces of absolutely historic but dated pieces of film or culture. 

At the time, Catcher was a bit of a revolution. It was a voice that was unrepresented, a story that primarily didn't exist. Teenagers, such as Holden was, hadn't existed as a social construct for very long at the time it was written. He represented the creation of a genre, a story, and experience. 

Now that his story has set the standard and the trope is set and understood, going back and reading it is underwhelming. Just like going back for someone of this generation watching the Godfather is likely to be underwhelmed. Their influence on the culture has been too profound and invasive, but it's rarely ever acknowledged. We just *expect* it now. 

It's like trying to argue (as I've seen someone do) that Half Life isn't a great game because it has since been surpassed in quality of storytelling and graphics by more recent games.

I watch both Godfathers (never seen 3) for the first time a few years ago and they are 2 of the best movies I've ever seen.,baileyjbarnes,2013-11-24T00:58:11Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,5
1ramwo_6,1ramwo,I'm from that school of thought as well. I thought Catcher in the Rye captured listlessness and uncertainty pretty well. And the Godfather is one of the best movies I've ever seen.

1ramwo_8,1ramwo,I totally agree. A movie like the Godfather could still be released now and be successful. It's a stunning movie and really does hold up.,DrMonkeyLove,2013-11-24T16:25:43Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,8
1ramwo_9,1ramwo,That's actually the first movie I was thinking of but I'm medicated and couldn't locate the name. The Godfather is probably the second or third on the list of classic movies many people my age (mid twenties) and younger are woefully underwhelmed by.  At least in my experience. Star Wars is probably up there too.,acadametw,2013-11-23T19:06:06Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,9

1ramwo_11,1ramwo,"I'm 22, all of my male friends I've talked about movies with (which is most of them because I really love movies) really like the Godfather and LOVE Star Wars. The only people I know what didn't think Star Wars was great are my parents because they think aliens are weird and that it's just for nerds. I really don't know where you're getting this from. Citizen Kane is the only one that really fits but I would guess a large majority of people my age haven't seen it in the first place.",baileyjbarnes,2013-11-24T01:05:37Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,11

Shawshank is also better as a movie, as is Forrest Gump.  I think you can reasonably disagree about The Godfather or Fight Club.

hy59i_8,hy59i,"The Godfather film is way better than the novel - Mario Puzo wasn't much of a writer; whereas, I would argue that Jaws is just different in film and novel format, not necessarily better or worse.

Jaws (the book) used the shark as a metaphor for the nastiness that exists under our noses in even the best of settings.  The fact that Brody and his family left the big bad New York of the 1970s for an idyllic island only to wind up being threatened by wildlife, small town incompetence / corruption, class warfare, infidelity, and other shenanigans created a great dynamic and an interesting read with more anxiety versus horror.

The movie - and I am a huge fan - created some fun characters, great scenes that weren't really in the book, and was a good story, but it was lacking depth, and the characters seemed shallow (they all had backstories, but they were a little too cut and dried, too perfect for the parts they played in the story).  Still, there are aspects of that film that are unforgettable.",trustmeep,2011-06-13T14:06:14Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,8

ewf3tv_1,ewf3tv,"The reason I love the Godfather is that it was written and then written and directed by Italian Americans who understood how it was. The mob story was just a cover for the immigration story. The clash of old values and new. It's why it works. 

Unless this author spent a lot of time with people who lived this experience I struggle to see this as a book worth reading. I once a series of books written about the Navajo reservation and the life there. It included a supernatural storyline that included the spiritual history of that tribe. The author moved to the reservation, made friends and was an honorary tribe member. He wrote a great book because he took the time to learn about the people he wrote about. If she took some serious effort to be educated I applaud her. If she just used her imagination I understand your resentment.

Don't write about a culture that isn't yours unless you take some serious effort to get it right.",applefrank,2020-01-31T02:43:25Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,1

I was suckered into reading The Godfather Returns or whatever it was called. It was some official sequel that wasn't written by Puzo.

That was a regretful decision.",walrusvonzeppelin,2015-01-13T17:54:32Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,1
2gjsme_1,2gjsme,"No, the Egyptian has been one of my favorite books since I was a child. You are the self important one qualifying his best book as the worst just based on your own opinion (regardless of worldwide critical acclaim). I just became aware recently how popular this novel was once worldwide, but I wasn't surprised... In my personal opinion it seems moronic to say to say Sinuhe is Waltari's worst book without first qualifying it as an opinion. The Finnish government just issued a gold coin with Waltari on one side,  and an Egyptian on the other side. .
TEST Which of these two statements sounds less moronic to you: 
1_The Godfather is Coppola's worst movie. 
2_ In my opinion, The Godfather is Coppola's worst movie. 
Both moronic, like your statement,  however 2 is the right choice. ",pablito69,2014-09-18T03:51:14Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,The Godfather,1

Today I was looking on Instagram and came across this kid who calls himself ""The Sneaker Don"". I've heard about the Godfather before reading of course but it's weird that I couldn't recall ever seeing the phrase ""the Don"" until I started reading it.
