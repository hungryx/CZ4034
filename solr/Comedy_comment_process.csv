12lyat4_1,12lyat4,"New Orleans local here.

While the internet and TV have made a lot of us lose the stereotypical accents and whatnot, the vernacular in this book was spot on for the time. The description of the city and life in it was dead on for the time and is still fairly accurate in the modern day.

There is also a statue of Ignatius J Reilly on Canal St (the main boulevard in downtown NOLA) in front of one of the hotels.

We love us some John Kennedy Tool, at least posthumously. It's sad that he did not live to hold his Pulitzer Prize. A Confederacy of Dunces did not do well while he was alive, and its failure, along with a string of others, led him to take his own life at 31 years old in 1969. He was not awarded the Pulizter until 1981.",,2023-04-14T22:01:41Z,Confed of Dunces,COMMENT,1

kgrc2m_2,kgrc2m,"A Confederacy of Dunces is one of a small set of books that I classify as ""so successful at its intent that it becomes unreadable.""  
  
I'm fully aware that the characters are irredeemable because they're *written* to be irredeemable.  And that the situations in the book are cringeworthy because they're *written* to be cringeworthy, and that the plot is painful to read because it's *written* to be painful to read.  
  
The problem is that O'Toole succeeded in writing a book with characters that are so irredeemable, situations so cringeworthy, and plot so painful that I simply can't read the book.  

It's as if a sculptor took a block of marble and carved it into an enormous fecal bolus so incredibly lifelike that it was like a giant took a dump right there on the floor of the MoMA.  
  
I could understand that the artist *intended* for his work to be revolting, but I would not have any desire to view it, and if I had done so after repeated and persistent urging from friends and fellow sculpture enthusiasts, I would regret it immediately.

1jzu3k_3,1jzu3k,"Shit, I wish I had an answer to this question because I've wondered the same thing myself. It's pretty much my favorite novel, and on one hand one of the reasons it is so special to me is that as far as I know it IS one of a kind, nothing I've read has ever come close. And books I have read that are touted as being like it in the pretentious superlative blurbs on the back are NEVER anything like it, in my experience (reviewers/other authors do the same thing regarding The Catcher in the Rye). In my opinion people don't really know what they're talking about when they try to compare other books to it... The closest I find are books that aren't at all like ACOD itself overall, but include a character that is vaguely similar to Ignatius, but not quite. Though maybe this is what you're looking for.

Anyway, on the other hand I do find it really frustrating, the fact that there aren't other novels legitimately similar enough to satisfy me, because I would like to read things that make me think of A Confederacy of Dunces, even if they are obvious imitators. 

I'm anticipating that Don Quixote will be the most mentioned book in this thread. I tried to slog through it once basically for this reason, but didn't get too far. I'm curious to see what else gets mentioned though.",withnailplus1,2013-08-09T01:07:07Z,Confed of Dunces,COMMENT,3
1jzu3k_4,1jzu3k,"Slightly off topic, but a good definition of literature (as compared to genre fiction) is that there aren't obvious equivalents to the book. You might adore certain sci fi or fantasy novels, and if you want more of the same it's quite easy to find many other books. However, if you want more of A Confederacy of Dunces, it's not simply a matter of finding another book about New Orleans hot dog salesmen.

Dunces is an amazing book though, and not just because Ignatius is such a masterfully written character. It's one of the few books I can read over and over again and get as much enjoyment out of as i did the first time i read it.",xXSpookyXx,2013-08-09T02:04:19Z,Confed of Dunces,COMMENT,4

g5tkde_1,g5tkde,"Interestingly, the author -John Kennedy Toole-Would never see the success of his book.
He committed suicide (1969) shortly after writing the manuscript. His mother found the copy in his home and tried to get it published multiple times, with no success. She finally convinced author/professor Walker Percy to read the manuscript.
These were his words in the Forward :

“ ...the lady was persistent, and it somehow came to pass that she stood in my office handing me the hefty manuscript. There was no getting out of it; only one hope remained—that I could read a few pages and that they would be bad enough for me, in good conscience, to read no farther. Usually I can do just that. Indeed the first paragraph often suffices. My only fear was that this one might not be bad enough, or might be just good enough, so that I would have to keep reading. In this case I read on. And on. First with the sinking feeling that it was not bad enough to quit, then with a prickle of interest, then a growing excitement, and finally an incredulity: surely it was not possible that it was so good.”

That it is relatable to this era we currently find ourselves in is amazing.

I both agree and disagree with this. It seems like guys like Ignatius are a dime a dozen nowadays, especially in certain convoluted right wing circles on the internet. I also see a lot of borderline autistic qualities in his character. If A Confederacy of Dunces had been written nowadays it would've been seen as a deeply tragic and disturbing work.

French and English translations were published in 1887, and a German translation in 1889. European critical response was also largely negative, mainly due to the novel's apparent formlessness and rambling style.[^(\[70\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot#cite_note-FOOTNOTETerras199014-70) Morson notes that critics saw it as ""a complete mess, as if it were written extemporaneously, with no overall structure in mind—as, in fact, it was.""[^(\[71\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorson20187-71) Typical of the western critics was the introduction to the first French translation which, while praising the energetic style and characterization, notes that ""they are enveloped in a fantastic mist and get lost in innumerable digressions.""

Prominent modern critics acknowledge the novel's apparent structural deficiencies, but also point out that the author was aware of them himself, and that they were perhaps a natural consequence of the experimental approach toward the central idea. Joseph Frank has called *The Idiot* ""perhaps the most original of Dostoevsky's great novels, and certainly the most artistically uneven of them all,""[^(\[73\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot#cite_note-73) but he also wondered how it was that the novel ""triumphed so effortlessly over the inconsistencies and awkwardnesses of its structure."" Gary Saul Morson observes that ""*The Idiot* brings to mind the old saw about how, according to the laws of physics, bumblebees should be unable to fly, but bumblebees, not knowing physics, go on flying anyway.""[^(\[71\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorson20187-71)",Unusual_Bee_7561,2023-11-27T14:43:04Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,1

I felt like compared to Crime and Punishment and Notes From The Underground (the two other Dostoevsky books I've read- same as you), The Idiot had a much lighter tone. It was pure and light, reminding me of summer days. The ending could not have been further from that, and that made it hit so much harder.

It's also interesting to look at the foreshadowing. Throughout the whole book, Nastasya is saying that Rogozhin will kill her, and I'm pretty sure both the Prince and Rogozhin agree that this is possible. Then there's the scene in Rogozhin's house where the Prince keeps picking up Rogozhin's knife.

ywxgvd_1,ywxgvd,"I'm not trying to be disrespectful when I say that I think that your dissatisfaction with the book may stem from the fact that you are only engaging with Dostoevsky's writing at a surface level. To be more precise, it seems to me that you put too much emphasis on the plot and not enough on the philosophical arguments that Dostoevsky makes throughout *The Idiot*.

*The Idiot*, among other things, looks at the state of human nature. Is it possible for man to be truly good? Is human nature inherently good (as Rousseau claimed) or is it inherently corrupt and evil (as Augustine believed)? And what implications does this have on the way we live our lives? 

The entire book talks about complex philosophical issues such as the ones mentioned above. Its length can largely be attributed to the extensive dialogue that characterises Dostoevsky's work, and which is necessary for the dialectical approach to learning that Dostoevsky adopts throughout his works.

15dszwi_1,15dszwi,"Yeah I think there’s a lot about the Idiot which is interesting. I believe Dostoevsky remarked at one point that he was dissatisfied with the result and would have changed some things about the novel if he could write it again. This may play into some of your qualms with the book. 

I think that, and I’ve said this before on Reddit, but I think that Dostoevsky’s novels follow almost a linear philosophical train that enhances the readings as you take in more of his work. There are overlapping themes and taking in each novel grants one a dose of some perspectives on some of the bigger ideas. 

Many of his books are filled with explosive characters that are both verbose and impulsive. I do not know if he saw much of the populace in that way or if it was to amplify a message he intended.",arcangel092,2023-07-30T19:32:00Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,1

A lot of people say he is “Christlike” but I completely disagree … he is literally just a naive idiot with no social skills.  A character like that is really interesting conceptually, but in execution it gets really frustrating to read bc he never learns anything and leaves a lot of damage in his wake. 

If you like Crime & Punishment you should like BK.  It is not about high society more maybe upper middle class.  The characters are among of the most memorable ever written … and believable.",GuyMcGarnicle,2023-07-30T19:46:58Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,2
18eo4n9_1,18eo4n9,"NFU doesn't make sense unless if you have read nearly his whole bibliography. It makes sense if you have BK and The Idiot mostly fleshed out, mainly the shift from religious morality to socialist atheist human determinism. 

Of all of his works, The Idiot is probably the most incoherent. But I still love it for its theme: a pure heart is mistaken as a naive fool, and he does not survive the modern world. This also has the underlying theme of the shift from religion and purity towards corruption, lies, usurpery, chaos in the new world. 

BK is arguably his ultimate. It's a bit to get through, but entirely worth it if the themes above seem interesting to you. D does not create false constructions or strawmen, he pits two opposing thoughts against each other during what was a very large shift in culture that plays out over a century, and gives them both their due.

v41t86_1,v41t86,"Dostoevsky struggled with the fact the he lived in a supposedly Christian society while the values, ambitions and motivations of so many 'virtuous' people stood in stark contrast to their professed faith. Now perhaps you aren't religious yourself or weren't raised that way, then I can understand where these struggles of faith might not ring out from the surface of the novel where the prince represents a truly Christ like figure set against the nineteenth century Russian aristocracy. However, looking beyond that, there's a theme throughout where everyone, including the prince seem to say one thing but do another. In fact, the prince indicates that the only people a person can be truly authentic with are children. However, unlike his counterparts, the prince is only inauthentic because of altruism. He would spare another's feelings for instance. Like how he would marry Natasha (I can't quite remember her name) in order to restore her honor, which is only necessary due to the hypocritical and judgemental attitudes of the society's elites. He would do what he could to spare her that suffering. She herself sees this because they aren't that different and consequently chooses to go with Rogozin which is basically the choice of self annihilation. In the end, the inability to spare her ruins Mushkin. This is all good stuff just at the narrative level.

Going beyond that, I first picked this book up because I had been on a big Nietzsche kick and read the he had once said that, in reference to The Idiot, Dostoevsky was the only psychologist that he felt he had anything to learn from. He himself thought in terms of levels of power. For instance, one level is punching someone. A higher level, in his view, is person who causes someone to lose control and hit them. That person has made one cede his own autonomy. In the Idiot, you can see throughout the novel this game of social Jenga. Everyone is trying to one up another and Dostoevsky goes through and gives many many different examples in how that plays out. Like hippolite's suicide attempt comes to mind where he was never in any danger but one character, I can't remember who says that they can't tell him that. The reason being that he would realize that his attempt wasn't being taken seriously. In that, he would then actually kill himself.

However, there is definitely something wrong there. He doesn’t belong. His “qualities “ are so extreme/pure that they can hinder normal relations and activities. A person needs intellectual resilience and emotional diversity to lead a healthy life. The prince doesn’t. I can’t think of a better way to describe him in one word, than “the idiot”.

s3p7fu_1,s3p7fu,"While the Idiot is often touted as Dostoyevsky's least profound major work, it can sometimes be argued as one of his most intimate and cherished pieces due to the nature of topics and ultimate resolutions that Myshkin faces towards the end of the book. 

I'm 100% in agreement with you OP, I'm not arguing! Just trying to add some thoughts!

I feel like after reading TBK, Demons, Notes and C&P this book is certainly a little more dry than the others but I oftentimes wonder if it's because of my perception of all of his other pieces that make me feel that way. Dostoysvky was another pay-for-pages author so he definitely had his fair share of writing to meet a deadline type work but I wonder if this made his writing have more panic or paranoia intertwined because he knew how much he needed to finish the section before a certain time..?

l93zf3_2,l93zf3,">While the book was interesting in parts (specifically Parts 1 and 4 for me). I felt it just dragged on

Actually there is an explanation to why Part 1, the beginning of Part 2 and the end of Part 4 do feel different to the rest of the book. Dostoevsky started to write The Idiot in Geneva, just after marrying his wife, who was about to give a birth to the first Dosto's child. Being on the edge of poverty and putting all his stakes on the success of the new novel he decided to write about the dearest thing, which he had never even dare to try before, - the Christ-like character (in the drafts prince Myshkin was prince Christ). Moreover, The Idiot is the only novel which contains autobiographical moments which Dosto had never dared to write about, neither before, nor after - specifically, his ""last"" moments in front of the shooting squad. So, as you see, Dosto was literally pouring his heart, his soul into this novel.

Around the time of finishing the Part 1 his daughter was born, Sonya. But then, in 3 months she died (exactly by the time he finished first chapters of Part 2). There are little words which can describe how this event crashed Dosto, after that he wasn't able to write for about 6 months, had to move to another city, and then eventually to another country (Italy). 

I think now you see the connections. About the end of the book - I think Dosto envisioned it from the very beginning, so is wasn't that much influenced by the events of his life. Or, maybe it was influenced, I don't know. But what is for sure, already in the first chapters of Part 1 and Part 2 Myshkin had predictied the outcome of Rogozhin and Nastasya relations.

> Overall, it didn't seem to pack the same punch as Notes from the  Underground or C&P. It didn't really explore the human psyche as  well as it's predecessors also, in my opinion.

It does, the only problem that comprehending Myshkin is way much more difficult then Raskolnikov, or the Underground man, which is basically the core of the tragedy of this novel, unfortunately. 

>I felt the ending was quite predictable.

Yeah, already commented on that.

>I know people attribute passions to his motivation, but I don't feel  there is enough evidence to draw such a conclusion. From my  understanding each of the three main characters were intended to reflect  the three dimensions of F.: his unwavering devotion to his faith (the  prince); the nihilism he experienced and was surrounded by during his  exile (Ippolit); but what dimension did Rogozhin represent?

Dostoevsky was very, *very passionate man.* So Rogozhin definitely represents this part of Dosto. Also, a small remark - the exile is *the time* when he found his faith. *Before* it he was surrounded by nihilistic ideas, especially during literature evenings in Petrashev's club. Obviously, founding his faith didn't mean that his doubts disappeared, that's true. But i would even argue that in his exile, in ""ostrog"" (russian prison in Siberia) he was surrounded by the largest amount of believers. Also, the only book prisoners were allowed to read in ostrog was New Testament (the exact version of the book he had in ostrog he kept for the rest of his life).

>While I agreed with his answer in the end, I don't think it was  delivered in the profound way that was similar to his previous books.

About agreeing with the ending - perhaps you misunderstood it a bit. Read his short story ""The Dream of Ridiculous Man"" to understand the concept better.

>but it still left me a bit disappointed knowing what F. was capable of with his previous works.

Personally, as you can already guess, The Idiot is my favorite of his novels. The closest touch to Dosto heart, the tragedy of our modern society, but still giving some hope and light in the end of the tunnel (yeah, counterintuitive to the ending, but once again, read The Dream of Ridiculous Man).

>On to Demons now, which I'm still excited about.

Good luck with that, hope you will enjoy it. Just as a warning - first hundred or so pages can be quite boring, but believe me, they're a the necessary foundation for the rest of the book. And don't miss the censored chapter ""At Tikhon"" - it should be the last one, even though initially Dosto put it in the end of Part 2.",Val_Sorry,2021-01-31T18:12:37Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,2

You definitely make me want to go back to it, as back then my attention mainly went to the unfolding of the narrative and later to the philosophy behind it, and not so much to the overall structure of the novel.

If you read The brothers Karamazov and The Idiot one after the other you probably noticed the similarity between the prince and Alyosha Karamazov which is pretty interesting, especially for the ways in which they differ. I feel like Dostoevsky has a few archetypes of charachters he explored, I remember noticing a resemblance between Agláya Ivánovna from The Idiot and Lizaveta Nikolaevna Tushina (I think it was her) from The Demons.",__dash,2021-07-05T21:16:07Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,3

I did thoroughly enjoy it though; Myshkin is, like you say, such an adorable character, and it is really hard to see all the hardships he goes through.  I just wanted the poor guy to catch a break.

However, I don't think that it is better than *Crime And Punishment*, and I also honestly found *Demons* to be very enthralling, if a bit overlong; but *The Idiot* resting at the third spot in my ranking of novels by Dostoyevsky is no shade to its content.  I've also read two different translations of *Notes From The Underground*, and while I feel that I grasp its intention, I don't find it as powerful as the three novels that I've read.

k011p_1,k011p,"What I've learned about Dostoevsky (after having read *Brothers Karamazov* twice and *Crime and Punishment* once) is that he puts a *lot* of social commentary in his books that we, as 21st Century Americans (assuming you're in the USA) often miss. Remember, Dostoevsky was writing from the perspective of a 19th-Century Eastern Orthodox Christian Russian. Many of the things he addresses may seem irrelevant to us but were big issues in his time (such as 19th-Century Eurpoean philosophies such as nihilism that were making inroads among the educated and the wanna-be educated in Russia), but many of the more ""psychological"" issues are timeless.

In other words, read Dostoevsky like it's literature (which it is). By that, I mean, keep an eye out for where he might be saying more than is immediately apparent.

I have yet to read *The Idiot* (I'm looking forward to getting around to it someday), but I can't recommend *Crime and Punishment* and *The Brothers Karamazov* highly enough.

k011p_8,k011p,"The Idiot is one of my favorite books, but I agree that it is pretty confusing.  In fact, I think that Dostoevsky intentionally made it that way.  He is more unconventional than one might think at first.  All this stuff is happening and he does not really stop to explain what is going on.  Some of it seems a little pointless, although it's probably not.  My opinion is that he uses these techniques to enhance the sense of present reality and to depict people as true agents with infinite potential.  He was a big fan of the Hegelian concept of ""man as idea"", which is about a person continually expressing and creating himself.  I don't really know what I'm talking about, but I'm trying to say that Dostoevsky uses these techniques to express a mystery at the heart of our existence in a way that few artists have.",ablakok,2011-08-31T21:58:43Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,8

91o479_2,91o479,"I'm sorry to say, but I think you might have missed the point of the book a bit. 

The point wasn't that The Prince was an absolute idiot who did dumb shit - in fact, despite his 'title', The Prince displays some of the most profound moments of intelligence in the book. From making the children sympathize with and eventually love the doomed peasant girl they had previously ridiculed, to basically everything involving Nastasya Filippovna, I'd argue The Prince is actually highly intelligent. 

A little context is needed. Dostoevsky was a very devout Orthodox Christian. The Idiot is based on the author's idea of the most 'good' man, and in the eyes of a Christian, that would have to be Jesus Christ. So what the book wants to explore is what would happen if the most good man, Christ himself, who embodied Christian love and compassion, would be placed into a society devoid of those values. So it's almost like Dostoevsky was testing his own Christian values against that of Russian society, a theme which pops up in the novel in explorations of spirit of the Russian man, and I think is symbolised by The Prince's profound interest in Holstein's [The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/The_Body_of_the_Dead_Christ_in_the_Tomb%2C_and_a_detail%2C_by_Hans_Holbein_the_Younger.jpg).

Why The Prince is ironically called an idiot in the novel's title, and is mistakenly considered such by characters in the book, is his kindness, empathy, and open-hearted honesty, all of which are mistaken for a lack of intellect and insight by the other characters who lack these qualities. And as a result of the defeat of these qualities, the book is naturally hopeless because the goodness of Christ is destroyed in Saint Petersburg society (which comes back around to the image of the decaying Christ in Holstein's painting, which I highly recommend checking out).

4soglc_1,4soglc,"Hi,

I read it many years ago but I love that book, probably it's my favorite.  
The first thing to say is that Dostoevskij's goal was to write the story of a man who was ""absolutely good"". Besides Jesus, he thought, the only character in literature who had been shown to be completely uncorrupt had been Don Quijote, but his adventures were a comedy, while Dostoevskij wanted to write a tragedy. His book shows the failure of such a man in a contemporary setting.  
But, alas, that was not the only failing, since Dostoevskij felt he didn't manage to reach his goal. To him, ""The Idiot"" was a book he hadn't been able to complete as he wished.

I think these are two elements to consider when you look at the book. It touches a lot of themes but the main one is the failure of Myskin to save Nastasya, another beautiful soul which has been corrupted (she was raped as a child), and who is now torn between Myskin's love and Rogozin's, his nemesis.  
With ""Demons"" another of my favorites, it's one of the most pessimistic books by Dostoevskij, there are no glimpses of redemption as in ""Crime and Punishment"" or ""Th Brothers Karamazov"".

English is not my first language so I am sorry if I couldn't express myself properly as I wished.",FrothOnTheDaydream,2016-07-13T21:32:31Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,1
4soglc_2,4soglc,"As fascinating as The Idiot is many people regard it as a failure. The problem I've always thought was that Dostoevsky set Myshkin up as a Christ-figure defined by his meekness and spiritual sensitivity is an increasingly despiritualized and nihilistic Russia, but he never found a way to complete the Christ analogy. Likely this would have required some act of self sacrifice probably on behalf of Nastasya Filipovna. As to why Dostoevsky decided to end it the way he did we can only speculate.

But I think I came to respect The Idiot for its look at society and interpersonal relationships with a similar detail to C&P's introspective perspective. I think. I mean, I'm definitely dressing up my opinion of it, but Myshkin's comparative outsider status gives him a unique perspective on society in the same way that Raskolnikov's...issues gave him a unique perspective on the psyche. If The Idiot is to be compared favorably to C&P, I would think it's as a result of the greater number of more complex characters, and the added exploration of their relationships, compared to C&P's very narrow focus. As [this review](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/26/highereducation.classics) puts it (and in the words of Dostoevsky himself), The Idiot is about characterizing ""a completely beautiful human being,"" which I interpret in many ways as a perfect foil to Raskolnikov.

yzbnu_2,yzbnu,"It might help your understanding of *The Idiot* if you read *Don Quixote*  as well. Both books are, essentially, about the conflict between reality and the ideal. Both men are, in a way, caricatures of Christ. Dostoyevsky said himself in a letter in 1868:

> The main idea of the novel is to present a positively beautiful man. This is the most difficult subject in the world, especially as it is now. All writers, not just our, but European writers, too, have always failed whenever they attempted a portrait of the positively beautiful. Because the task is so infinite. The beautiful is an ideal, but both our ideal and that of civilized Europe are still far from being shaped. There is only one positively beautiful person in the world, Christ, and the phenomenon of this limitlessly, infinitely beautiful person is an infinite miracle in itself. (The whole Gospel according to John is about that: for him the whole miracle is only in the incarnation, in the manifestation of the beautiful.) But I am going too far. I’d only mention that of all the beautiful individuals in Christian literature, one stands out as the most perfect, Don Quixote. But he is beautiful only because he is ridiculous. Dickens’ Mr. Pickwick (who is, as a creative idea, infinitely weaker than Don Quixote but still gigantic) is also ridiculous but that is all he has to captivate us. Wherever compassion toward ridiculed and ingenious beauty is presented, the reader’s sympathy is aroused. The mystery of humor lies in this excitation of compassion.

This is also a major difference between the two novels. Don Quixote may be an active man, a hero (or at least try to be) but Myshkin is almost entirely passive. In many ways he's a personification of the Beatitudes.",sausagesizzle,2012-08-29T03:42:25Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,2

However, I have to say that *The Idiot* is not the most polished representation of his work.

6zuopf_1,6zuopf,"As someone below said, Welcome to Russian literature. I know quite a few Russian speakers who have the added benefit of an intimate knowledge of the language and culture who are left puzzled by the writings of Dostoevsky. I'll just say you haven't experienced the true bewilderment one gets on reading Crime and Punishment. 

Anyway, The Idiot is a daunting task, both to read and to understand. You must realise that Dostoevsky is a philosopher.  While he might not write philosophical treatises, he does incorporate certain subjects into his writing. The good news is that The Idiot is largely devoid of these philosophical points (as far as I can tell. If anyone can refute me then please do). The bad news is that The Idiot is a largely spiritual work, one which deals with the state of the Russian man. 

Dostoevsky, as far as I know, was not affiliated with the Slavophile movement. He did, however, share many ideological views with them. Just to quickly say that the Slavophile moment was a 19th century intellectual movement born out of a contempt for the Westernisation Russia underwent during the reigns of Catherine the Great and Peter the Great. Many saw the decline of Russian values, which were perceived as unique, as a threat to Russia itself, and proposed modelling Russia on traditional Orthodox values (many valued the church above the state) and trying to restore Russia to it's glorified past. 

And this is largely the basis of the book. It tries to examine the spiritual conflict taking place within Russia during the 19th century. The characters within the book are, by and large, terrible people. They're schemers, or damaged or outright rogues. There's one shining example of a good character, one who's used as a contrast to this 'degradation', and that's The Prince. Dostoevsky wanted to see what would happen if the purest man were to be placed in this network of bad people. Bearing in mind that D was a devout Christian, who is the purest man that could be thought up? Of course the answer is Christ himself. 

So that's what the book is. It's examining the spiritual state of the Russian man during the processes of increased Westernisation during the 19th century. I'm not surprised if you feel somewhat disturbed by the book's conclusion. There is no redemption in the end. The degraded Russian spirit, owing to increased European influence, destroyed Christ, and this influence was only increasing in Dostoevsky's mind (you might recall the closing paragraph where Lizaveta Prokovfyevna comments on the railways going evermore East and ominously encroaching on Russia).

This is the main point of the book, in my mind at least. There are other conclusions I've drawn from reading the book, but there is not the space here to adequately detail it. So I'll leave it here. ",ImALivingJoke,2017-09-13T22:11:57Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,1

I think the biggest difficulty I am having is tracking exactly how Myshkin's actions and thoughts are supposed to represent the 'perfect' man. I just don't see it, at all. And I feel like it is really holding me back from fully understanding what Dostoevsky is trying to say...

I don't see Myshkin as perfect, or beautiful... I just see him almost as essentially... a nonentity. ",flannel_jackson,2017-09-13T22:56:43Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,2
6zuopf_3,6zuopf,"Do you know what the word мышь (mysh') means in Russian? It's 'mouse', and 'Myshkin' is a diminutive of this word. So Myshkin is meant to be almost a nonentity. It's my understand that he's meant to be almost like a mouse in every scene. He's not meant to dominate each scene; he's meant to give way to bigger personalities and schemers. 

What defines The Prince is how he influences other characters despite his insignificance during each scene. While in other books characters influence the plot alone, the Prince acts to both forward the plot and influence the actions of other characters. If we think about the first time Nastasya Fillipovna met the Ivolgins, she was extremely rude initially to Ganya's family. However, due to the Princes' words, she becomes much more courteous and actually greets Ganya's mother with a kiss on the hand. And this is true throughout the novel with several characters. While he might seem like a nonentity, he's actually the most important character because it's his wholly perfect self, his rejection of societal norms, his sincerity, and his compassion, that makes otherwise reprehensible people rethink they're actions and promptly act in a much better way. 

How he is the 'perfect' man is that he is based upon Christian ideas of the ideal man, thus meaning Christ himself. He's free of any violence whatsoever, even to the point where he'll allow himself to be attacked without resistance (often to the ire of other characters). We see this in the scene where the Nihilists come to Lebedevs' and demand money from the Prince on falsified inheritance claims. The Prince allows them to continuously insult him, and after even offers them financial aide and assistance despite their fraudulent claims and personal attacks against his persons.

He's also devoid of the prejudices normal in society and possesses a strong insight into other characters. Fillipovna is a 'damaged' woman. She is Totsky's woman, and everyone knows it. It's for this reason no one will marry her, and Ganya will only do so for a large dowry from Totsky. The Prince sees through this, and what's more, unlike every other character he understands Fillipovna's actions are a result of the internalised feelings of hatred and resentment resultant from the sexual abuse and subsequent shame prescribed by society onto her. This is how he is able to influence her throughout the novel. 

Another reason why he is the perfect man is his sincerity. He's called 'The Idiot' because, unlike every other character, he is completely honest. This is rare in a world where no one means what they say. These are the reasons he's the perfect man. His actions throughout the novel are marked by a continued effort to benefit other characters, selfless actions which are to the point of harmful to himself. 

I'm not sure if any of this helps you or if the Prince is still alien to you. If there's one piece of advice I can give, it's contrast the Prince with other characters and see how much he departs from their actions and speech. ",ImALivingJoke,2017-09-13T23:39:14Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,3

Brothers K could certainly be read in chunks but I think it's the kind of book you really should commit to if you're gonna try reading it.  It's long and dense but I found it so compelling that I could hardly put it down.

I'd recommend this order: C&P, The Possessed (Demons), The Idiot, Brothers K. The Idiot and The Possessed are probably interchangeable depending on what you're in the mood for (The Idiot is a more personal novel, while The Possessed is probably Dostoevsky's most political) but I think ending with Brothers K is key.

12onqwk_1,12onqwk,"Having read The Idiot, Crime and Punishment, and The brothers Karamazov all in English, i say that they are DEFINITELY worthwhile books to read. I loved those books to death even during the more ""boring"" parts. But despite how much I genuinely enjoyed them all and felt I got a ton out of them, I struggled to finish them so as it was. They are very long, intricate, wordy, and I found myself digging backwards into the book a lot in order to reread certain things and fully grasp the entirety of the stories and all their intricacies. Not to mention the fact that Dostoyevsky has about 5 different names for each character, which I got used to, but still had me looking back trying to figure out who was talking sometimes. But God do I love his works. Anyway.

All of this to say, as much as I would love to be able to read a Dostoyevsky work in the original written language, I cannot FATHOM simultaneously learning a language and using that language to read a novel like the Idiot.

Dostoevsky's stream of consciousness style created such intimate portraits of his characters. From Prince Myshkin to Svidrigailov, it was hard not to feel for his characters, the saint-like and the beastly alike.

dyj8x3_4,dyj8x3,"The Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin noted that virtually all of Dostoevsky's main characters are defined by the experience of threshold, unable to move towards a half-formed image of the way they could be (or society could be) but unwilling to move back either. This produces a strange sort of hysteria in them, which oscillates between agony and ecstasy, and actively resists the simplification of character into archetype. As Bakhtin put it: ""Dostoevsky always represents a person on the threshold of a final decision, at a moment of crisis, at an unfinalizable, and unpredeterminable, turning point for their soul.""

To modern readers, that aspect of his work can feel a little zany or anachronistic, but if you lean into it, the effect is still very powerful. Of course, it's important to see Dostoevsky's writings in context, as he seems to hear the music in distant rooms that weren't fully located within his lifetime. Whether that's his pre-articulation of Nietzsche, whose ideas seem to have found some inspiration or confirmation in Dostoevsky's novels, particularly Crime & Punishment and Karamazov. More importantly, although all of his work predates Freud's, you can often see Dostoevsky's intuitive sense of the subconscious, particularly in his tendency to turn to the inexplicable gesture over the statement — Lise privately crushing her finger in the door after humiliating Alyosha in Karamazov, or Myshkin trying to hide his face in a corner after being slapped by Ganya in The Idiot. He has a playwright's instinct for dramatic scene construction and the harmonic and dissonant potentials in dialogue, especially in his later work.

Bakhtin phrased that aspect of Dostoevsky as the attempt to write a polyphonic novel, where the clustering of separate, hyper-realised voices could allow both those characters and the reader to perceive a broader perspective of themselves, and indeed that without these external perspectives, it is impossible to be wholly known to oneself or to others.",Phineasfogg,2019-11-19T16:56:03Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,4

dyj8x3_7,dyj8x3,"I have recently started getting back into Dostoevsky at the age of 31. I tried reading *The Brothers Karamazov* in my early 20s but I didn't get very far. In a way, I think I just wasn't ""ready"" for Dostoevsky yet. But I always wanted to have the Dostoevsky experience, so to speak. What little I had heard about his psychospiritual themes sounded right up my alley. And, being a huge fan of Franz Kafka, I was curious to see why Kafka considered him such an important influence on his own writing. So I recently decided to finally take a serious dive into his works, and I'm already having that sensation of, ""Holy shit, I have *really* been missing out all this time!""

I first read *Poor Folk*, which was a very touching, but relentlessly bleak and sad story. I enjoyed it for the most part, though it's my understanding that it's often considered ""minor"" Dostoevsky, and not all that representative of his larger themes. Then I moved to *Notes From Underground*, which totally blew me away! The pained, conflicted rantings of the ""underground man"" resonated a lot with some of my own internal struggles over the years. I particularly enjoyed his musings on the irrational/contrary nature of human consciousness, existential boredom and inertia, the enigma of self, and the existence (or nonexistence) of freewill. And the final scenes between the troubled man and the young prostitute Liza were some of the most poignant things I've ever read. I loved it, and did a lot of page-marking and underlining of favorite lines throughout. Will definitely be reading it again eventually.

I'm currently about halfway through reading *Crime and Punishment* and I honestly can't even describe the powerful impression it is having on me so far. I'm amazed. I don't think I've ever read anything like this in my life. In it, Dostoevsky is drilling deeper into the human psyche than I ever thought writing could. It's remarkable how well he puts it all into words, and how relatable it all is. He's describing feelings and thoughts that I've just never heard described so subtly and acutely. It's the kind of thing that when you read it, you repeatedly go, ""Daaaamn, I know *exactly* the feeling he's talking about!"" It's like he's spelunking deep down into the murky human soul with a 1000-watt flood-lamp, exposing every sordid crevice, every obscure nook and cranny, all the things that we try to bury and look away from in mundane everyday life. I can definitely already see where his reputation as a literary genius came from. After I finish this book, I think I'm going to read *The Idiot,* and then try to finally tackle *The Brothers Karamazov.* I'm really excited for all that!",,2019-11-19T15:47:48Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,7

So many books I've read since have been much less enjoyable ever since just cuz they can't compare. Also, totally glad u say that about 'The Road,' that's the next book I plan on reading. I met Tim Kasher from Cursive and The Good Life a few months ago and he recommended that book claiming ""It will probably be considered the first **great novel** of the 21st century""",zsteelhammer,2014-06-24T00:41:47Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,3
8adr0n_1,8adr0n,"Having read The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment and The Idiot, which one would you recommend reading first? I've never read any of his works and I have basically zero expectations/opinions. Would appreciate guidance on where to start!",conyconycony,2018-09-04T04:17:29Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,1
8adr0n_2,8adr0n,"I think that's a little off. Dostoevsky was suspicious of Western Enlightenment thinking, but he didn't deny its value entirely. Rather, he thought it was a useful and powerful way of viewing the world, but lacking in a moral basis.

In his opinion, Russia had the two halves to make a great country, but lacked a way of uniting them. The Russian upper class had become too westernized and lost contact with its roots, while the lower class had retained its virtue and spirituality, but had been outdated and left behind by the advancing west. His 'pochvennichestvo' political ideology sought to heal Russia through what he saw as the only thing that could reunite these two groups: the Orthodox church, with its merging of Christianity (western) with traditional Russian values.

Many of Dostoevsky's characters seek what they sometimes call a 'binding idea' that can bring the country together, this is what he sought as well. For example, in *The Idiot* Myshkin speaks often of a unifying idea that could bring everyone together, and experiences something like that idea at the height of his epileptic fits (implied to be religious). Myshkin himself very much represents the ideal of combining Europe and Russia, as he was born in Russia but spent so much of his life in Switzerland. In *Crime and Punishment,* Raskolnikov throughout much of the book mentions how uneasy he feels around the peasants and other low-class people of Petersburg. He is certainly one of the westernized Russians at this point, being very fluent in western ideas and writing but having very little connection to his traditional roots (see his isolation from his family). But, pay attention to the epilogue - as soon as he embraces religion from Sonya, he feels a sudden fellowship and comradery with the other prisoners.

This, I think, is Dostoevsky's central political theme. Not that Westernism needs to be rejected entirely, but that it needs to be melded with traditional Russian values.",,2018-04-08T01:47:53Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,2
8adr0n_3,8adr0n,"Crime and Punishment for sure! It’s mostly everyone’s gateway to Dostoyevsky’s writing. Then I’d advise you to proceed with The Idiot which is much more slow-paced and just as detail oriented like C&P but without any of the action or suspense. But it’s a highly rewarding book and will definitely be worth it in the end! I personally love it just a little bit more than C&P... 

Lastly, The Brothers Karamazov! It was Dostoyevsky’s last novel and should be the last one you read too. It’s much longer than the previous two at roughly 1,000 pages. At times, it gets boring... but if you somehow get through it, you will emerge a new person. If there ever were a book which contained the meaning of life, this one is possibly it.

fbq4v0_1,fbq4v0,"Crime and Punishment is by far the most focussed Dostoevsky novel I have read. Karamazov makes it feel like a light book. TBK is great, but it is also long-winded with an incredible amount of tangents. I wouldn't try to plough through it for the sake of it. I tried to the first time and did not enjoy it. 

The Idiot is my favourite book by Dostoevsky. If you feel like you can't get past the first half or so of TBK, but want to keep reading Dostoevsky, I suggest giving The Idiot a go. It is a bit shorter and is a better segue into TBK.",Fawkes_91,2020-03-01T08:23:51Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,1

It's been a while since I've read them, but I distinctively remember The Brothers Karamazov being an easier and more captivating read than either Crime And Punishment or The Idiot - which were great, sure, but TBK was just an all-around faster, fun read.

The whole thing was interesting from the start, and the characters were all fascinating. Unlike C&P or The Idiot, which were more focused on specific characters, TBK is constantly switching around multiple characters and their own struggles, it kept the whole thing refreshing imo.",BlueUnknown,2020-03-01T12:21:05Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,2

Fast forward a few years and I one again have time for leisure reading and I pick up TBK and the idiot. 

I could only get through a third of TBK. It felt like there were a lot of pages that were messy and rambling. So I decided to switch it up and try to read the idiot. I liked it and found it quite funny and witty but my brain must've been fatigued trying to read this right after TBK because I wasn't able to handle the number of characters and POVs being thrown at me.

v975wc_1,v975wc,"I’m only just starting my journey into Dostoyevsky, but man, he is amazing. So far I’ve read The Gambler and Notes from the Underground. The Gambler is good, but Notes absolutely blew my mind. The man was a genius, full stop. 

Reading it took me back to a very dark moment in my life that I experienced a couple years ago, and it was super helpful in helping me process some of the emotions I felt during that experience. After I finished that book, I had to take a few days before I could start anything else because I needed to process it all. 

I’m planning on reading Crime and Punishment next and then moving onto his other major stuff like The Idiot, Demons, and ending with Brother’s Karamazov.

Denisovich was sentenced to time the gulags for making an insulting comment about Stalin in a letter.

68kc94_2,68kc94,"I think a first Dostoevsky should always be Crime and Punishment.

But The Idiot is one I often recommend to people because it can appeal to many different readers. There is a lot of St Petersburg high-society soap-opera type stuff which wouldn't normally grab me but it was hilariously entertaining. Then there is a very well done tale of Good vs Evil with Jesus vs Satan type metaphor. 

It's a very odd story but entertaining as hell. The end, not to spoil anything, but everyone I know who read the end told me of how they literally said ""what the fuck?"" out loud.

That said... read Crime and Punishment first. It really should be everyone's introduction to Dostoevsky.",TheManInEigengrau,2017-05-01T06:29:44Z,The Idiot,COMMENT,2

5ihpl8_1,5ihpl8,"I think the age at which you read The Catcher in the Rye and/or your ability to relate to Holden Caulfield plays an significant role in whether or not a person enjoys this book.


I actually picked it up in high school because we were required to write a research paper about a book and it seemed like a well-known book with a lot of resources and material to pull from; nothing more, nothing less. I read the book multiple times while writing the paper and enjoyed it every single time. It became my favorite book for years and still holds a special place for me. Now, don't get me wrong, I have always considered Holden immature and at times, completely insufferable, but I have felt that way about so many people, self included, at his age. I think the connection to the book comes from the reader's ability to empathize with Holden and the situations he finds himself in. You don't have to share his experiences or agree with his actions, but to really get on his level and take it all in. And to be fair, he does have his moments of maturity. At some point in our lives I think most of us have felt like Holden Caulfield - in between childhood and adulthood, not quite ready to move forward, but aware that we cannot go back, leaving us with a sense of confusion or alienation. Clearly the character has a slew of issues that many cannot relate to, but they all contribute to making him who he is, even if he isn't universally well-liked.

5ihpl8_2,5ihpl8,"Holden is supposed to be immature and he isn't supposed to be this wise person who sees all the phonies for what they are. He's a kid. A scared, probably emotionally scarred kid. He's terrified of growing up or any kind of change for that matter and just wants to go back to when his brother was still alive and everything made sense. The brilliant part of The Catcher in the Rye isn't this message that everyone in the world are a bunch of phony pricks (Holden is just as much of a phony; he's a pathological liar who hides from his own emotions and puts up a front the whole book). It's that Salinger made an incredibly real lost teenage kid and gave him this authentic, flawed, unreliable voice. It's relatable when you're a teenager because you feel so many of the same things, even if you're hiding from them like he is and it's relatable when you're older (at least for me) because you remember what it's like to be that age and feel lost like that.

5ihpl8_3,5ihpl8,"One of the last paragraphs of the book talks about ""you gotta let them reach for the golden ring"" or some such (I dont have the book on hand right now). From my understanding of the book, this is when Holden changes his outlook and is the keystone of the story.

 He has been struggling between adulthood and childhood throughout the weekend, for example when he goes and gets a drink with his old friend. He wants to drink like crazy ""like an adult"" but is actually acting like the ""same old Holden"" joking about flits like he did when he was younger.

So finally at the Carousel he sees his sister reaching for the golden ring, and almost falling in her attempts to grab it. Holden has been trying to ""be the Catcher in the Rye"" to stop the kids from getting ""hurt by the big scary world"" (like he was when his bother died). He realizes to let the kids be kids, even if they fall and scrape their knees along the way.

5ihpl8_5,5ihpl8,"I hated reading in high school. I was a bit of punk ass (a big punk ass) but I was always emotionally and spiritually intelligent, meaning my interior monologue was constantly self reflecting of who I was and where I was. I was an older brother and I was always wanting to protect him. I was in fights, did drugs, and got a felony all before the age of 17.

When I was a junior, my teacher had us read The Catcher in the Rye. The opening sentence was unlike any other book I have ever read. Here is an author who is basically making fun of every book before it. That got me interested. Then the character, this fragile punk going through a city after he is suspended from school, got me interested. He is just milling around a city, where ""phonies"" and other people he despises live and he has to deal with them. I've definitely felt that, AND I still feel that.

So here's this punk kid, who sort of hates life and wants people to just f*#@ off, but as he slowly narrates his story, he slowly becomes more self aware, because at his age, this is what happens. We don't know our place in the world, we're tired of people telling us what to do when they haven't figured out for themselves (hence term ""phonies"") and then the most powerful thing of all hit me. HE CARES ABOUT YOUTH. HE'S SCARED OF GROWING UP. No other book, no movie, really got inside the head of a kid who is f*@#ing scared out of his mind, yet plays it off like he's okay. It's represented by his actions of trying to hide the word f*@# in the bathroom, the ducks and where they will go during winter, and protecting all the children from wandering through thick stalk of rye and falling off a cliff. He knows the world is a messed up place and he isn't ready for it. In fact, he's scared as hell, and he knows that youth is short lived. 

THIS BOOK IS A STORY ABOUT A KID GROWING UP AND SCARED AS HELL DOING IT, WHILE BEING NOSTALGIC FOR THE IGNORANCE OF YOUTH. AND IT DID IT WITHOUT TELLING YOU. IT SHOWED YOU.

After this, I understood what an author did. He was a painter of words. This book showed me what a book is supposed to do. It's supposed to challenge you while relating to you.

The reference to the catcher in the rye is himself in a rye field trying to stop young kids from running off a cliff, which can be interpreted as him watching children grow up and trying to protect them from losing their innocence.

Reading it was like having a conversation with a shrink.  I was able to see from a birds eye view what his problems were, read what people around him thought of him, and see how having a mindset like his plays out in real life, and how awful such an existence would be.  I think his gripes are common with a lot of people, and the coming of age experience is something I think a lot of people could benefit from reading.  That's why I recommend this book to others.  It is, to me, best viewed through a reflective scope.  I remember being eerily similar to him, but then I also understand the flaws in his character through my own maturing process that has allowed me to look back on that point in my life from a critical standpoint.

mfazrp_1,mfazrp,"Not only do I love this book, I really think this is one of the greatest books I've ever read. Similar to other people in this thread, I had to read it twice. Once as a teenager, when I thought ""this book was garbage, I could have written it"", and a second time in my late 20s. It's an absolutely standout masterpiece to me now.

[What I got from the book is summed up extremely well by another redditor here. I've copied the text below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2h8egi/personal_reading_milestone_accomplished_i/ckqh6mj/)

Well, you sure haven't moved too far from what Reddit thinks about those books. I see this very same complaint about Catcher in the Rye all the time in this subreddit. 

I think what most people miss about Catcher in the Rye is that it is a story about lost innocence and alienation. They can't get past Holden's character and his personality and traits to see the themes his character reveals; a kind of losing the forest for the trees. 

At the same time, even though he's supposedly so annoying, Holden's character has resonated very strongly with teenagers and young adults, and perhaps some of the rest of us who remember what that was like. So there must be something true, something universal, about him. He is annoyingly sarcastic, yes. Whiny, sure. Without any goal or direction, of course. But why? Why does the author choose to describe him like that? 

The answer is, because he lacks connection with the world. He feels isolated. He feels as if he's a stranger. He's alienated, with no friends among the grown-up kids. He feels he's in a place where he doesn't belong. A very universal experience among children, teenagers, and even adults. But again, why? What does he hate about the world so much that he can't bring himself to fit in? 

Well, he says it all the time. He hates phonies. What does that mean? If you examine what he says he hates throughout the book, you'll realize he hates pretentiousness; he hates, for example, that D.B. is ""prostituting himself"" in Hollywood; he hates the kind of self-centered, self-important society that he is about to enter, by virtue of growing up. He craves all those qualities that he finds so genuinely and so spontaneously in children, like Phoebe: generosity, innocence, kindness. He himself is caught between the two worlds, and he hates that. And so he's whiny and sarcastic, and dreams that he could forever remain on the threshold of the grown up world, being the catcher in the rye, saving children from falling of the cliff - saving them from losing their innocence.

The Catcher in the Rye is really a kind of lament for the lost innocence of childhood, and about the disconnect those who exalt it, like Holden and presumably Salinger, experience when they enter a world that is so decidedly self-interested. But whatever your reason for feeling alone and isolated from the rest of the society, you can find a kind of universality in Holden. He's an outcast, a self-pariah, like so many others, and weirdly, wonderfully, this makes him part of a group; and so perhaps, like the Catcher in the Rye's optimistic ending is possibly meant to indicate, being an outcast is just a transient state of existence after all.",PepperJackson,2021-03-28T23:37:42Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1

mfazrp_4,mfazrp,"I'm an aussie too and Catcher is my favourite book and has been since I was 17 and had to  read it for school. I was the only one in class who liked it so I don't think it's an uncommon opinion at all.

As a teen who felt all those things; alienation, mental health issues,  that people were just ""phony"" and the world was a shithole, I strongly related it despite the setting of place and time. I liked the language and the way it created a voice, it's one of the strongest first person novels out there in my opinion. 

I also loved the psychology behind it and the dissection of different characters, some obvious and some you have to speculate more on. I loved the innocence of Holden, the observations about people and life he has (which is why I strongly disagree that it ""didn't really have anything to say""!)  I love the metaphor of the catcher in the rye and saving all the children from growing up because adulthood is a terrible thing. About wanting to keep everyone innocent. I think that's actually beautifully tragic. It speaks to a real fear of adulthood and how once you're an adult the worlds toxicity can infect you and change you.

So I love the different interpretations of the carousel at the end too - that it makes Holden realise that people have to move on and through life despite the risks of being hurt and scared, etc.

I think the book has a lot to say about the transition from being a child to an adult but it does work in a subtle way that not everyone gets or relates to. I know people in my class were like ""nothing happens"" which I couldn't believe because I felt like so much happened. I'm also an observer so I like all those snippets of him interacting with different people from different classes, jobs, etc and the 'small' things of every day life he notices.",lifeinwentworth,2021-03-29T09:13:25Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,4

I think if you read it as ""fucking hell this kid is an annoying bullshitter"" then it becomes a better book than assuming that there's any genuine wisdom in his irritating gibberish. Mind you Salinger never wrote another damn thing worth a mention other than a collection of also-annoying short stories so it's possible that he was just a big load of bollocks and The Catcher in the Rye mystifyingly gained popularity because he wrote it at exactly the right time for other kids to go ""YEAH, HOLDEN MAN, HE DOESN'T CONFORM!"".

mfazrp_10,mfazrp,"True, but that's the thing about society today, things of yesteryear are being judged by today's standards:

My 3-year-old daughter is able to (and will be able to) consume pop-culture in a way that myself, my wife and my parents never had the ability to do:  She'll be able to listen to music from vastly different eras without having an idea of the timeline, historical context or possibly even genre.  Everything is (and will be) available on demand and immediately. That goes for books, movies and TV shows too.

To her ""Mr. Rodger's Neighborhood"" and ""Sesame Street"" aren't old shows from decades ago. ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" isn't a 10 year old show. To her, they are just as new and relevant as ""Blaze and the Monster Machines"" or ""Pete the Cat"" and as she grows, the same will hold true for the adolescent and adult programing/music/movies/books she will be consuming.

This holds true right now as well.  Pop culture of yesteryear is being consumed today and compared to and judged by today's standards.

The Catcher in the Rye was very ahead of its time when released, but today it would be lost among the young adult novels being released, and I'm not sure it would even earn a single award or even a single review article written about it unless it was to complain about :

* Dated references and being set in the 1950's America
* The story feels tedious and monotonous
* The protagonist is from a well-off family and tells a cushy and privileged tale.
* The story lacks diversity in it's characters.
* The protagonist is unwilling to reflect on their own hypocrisy
* The protagonist looks down on everyone he comes in contact with and disregards them as 'phony'
* The protagonist has the view that if other people's ideas don't align with his own 100%, that automatically makes them phony.
* The musings on sex, growing up, family, literature, as well as every other topic he shares with overconfident opinion of being completely correct, everyone else's opinion is wrong and just reads as angry and immature.

Some others that I've noticed:

""Aladdin"" and ""Fantasia"" have disclaimers talking about insensitivity and stereotypes in the movies.

""Married... with Children,"" ""Duke of Hazard,"" ""Home Improvement,"" ""How I Met Your Mother,"" ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" ""Bewitched,"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie"" have all been accused of idolized masculinity, portraying offensive stereotypes and having very sexist storylines.

""Love Boat"" was accused of sexism and enabling the rape/date-rape culture where ""no doesn't necessarily mean no, you just have to keep asking""

“Friends"" has been accused of being homophobic, enabling fat-shaming, lacking diversity, only showing attractive white people and having a main character (joey) who is a misogynist as he pursues women who have rejected him, openly lies to women if it's in his best interest.

Music-wise ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" has raised questions over its appropriateness and possible ""date-rape"" connotations. ""Summer Nights"" from ""Grease"" has drawn ire for the line ""Tell me more, tell me more / Did she put up a fight?"". The Rolling Stone's ""Brown Sugar"" describes slavery, rape and other violence. Tim McGraw's ""Indian Outlaw"" is filled with derogatory stereotypes. ""Kung Fu Fighting"" pushes negative Asian stereotypes.

I don't think it is because people are overly-sensitive, it is that everything is readily available now, people are watching and listening with today's standards in mind and how we view old pop culture has changed.

And maybe, just maybe, it shows how we are growing and bettering ourselves? That we can recognize the mistakes made in the past and hopefully won't make in the future?  Or in 10-20 years we will look back at today's pop-culture and say how tone-deaf it was in regards to 'X' or 'Y'.",bschott007,2021-03-29T17:30:05Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,10

To me, it felt like Holden simply was a whiner. The novel was a let-down compared to the JD Salinger short stories I’d read, such as A Perfect Day for Bananafish.

I will say that at that time, mostly guys in the class liked the book, and very few of us girls did.  Perhaps it was aimed more at a teen male audience. 

At the time the only controversy about the book was some in the US believing it encouraged communism. I didn’t see evidence of that, nor any hint of “read this; shoot someone”. 

It’s sad that Salinger will mostly be remembered for The Catcher in the Rye, and not Franny & Zooey, or For Esme with Love & Squalor, simply because a few dolts in the eighties decided to use it as a prop when killing/trying to kill.",Mumofalltrades63,2021-08-30T18:40:49Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,5

peiw7o_7,peiw7o,"I think that most people are not aware of this. I know that we read Catcher in the Rye in 8th grade and I very vaguely caught on to the implications, but it didn’t fully register to me until I reread it in 12th grade.  Despite the fact that sexual violence and CSA is such a prevalent theme in the novel, as you’ve said, I’ve never met a teacher who brought up the topic. It’s like it goes completely over people’s heads.

Then again, I did meet a really pretentious guy in college who proudly told me I was a horrible person for liking CITR, because “JD Salinger had young women tied up and raped them in his basement.” There’s no proof of this ever having happened… but I think it’s funny how people will go to such extents to demonize the book and author.

Edit: I also don’t think that people are willfully ignorant to the sexual themes of the novel, but during the time it was published Salinger had to be very careful about being subtle about that topic. Otherwise his book never would have been published. The consequence of that, of course, is that he was perhaps too subtle. We all know that a huge theme of the novel is loss of innocence- “Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.” But the deeper, darker implications of the loss of innocence probably have gone over most peoples heads because that kind of thing was not openly discussed at the time that the novel came out, and nowadays the novel is barely taught in schools.",puffleintrouble,2021-08-30T19:13:39Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,7
peiw7o_8,peiw7o,"This book is generally seen as a red flag because Mark Chapman was holding it when he shot John Lennon.

Also, in the 90s it was banned at a lot of schools because it was ""too sexual"" for teens.

EDIT: Not sure why I'm being downvoted, but this book has definitely suffered popularity because of it's association with killers like Mark David Chapman.

""The best-known event associated with The Catcher in the Rye is arguably Mark David Chapman's shooting of John Lennon.[14] Chapman identified with the novel's narrator to the extent that he wanted to change his name to Holden Caulfield. On the night he shot Lennon, Chapman was found with a copy of the book in which he had written ""This is my statement"" and signed Holden's name.[15] Later, he read a passage from the novel to address the court during his sentencing.[16] Daniel Stashower speculated that Chapman had wanted Lennon's innocence to be preserved by death, inspired by Holden's wish to preserve children's innocence despite Holden's later realization that children should be left alone.[16]

After John Hinckley Jr.'s assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan in 1981, police found The Catcher in the Rye in his hotel room.[17] Hinckley later admitted to being an admirer of Chapman and studying his attempt on John Lennon. Hinckley's possession of the novel was later dismissed as an influence, as a half dozen various other types of books were also discovered in his possession.""",muthermcreedeux,2021-08-31T00:39:49Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,8

peiw7o_11,peiw7o,"I’m glad I came across this thread. I happened to just finish the book for the first time last night. I liked Holden and his narration. There were times it got annoying, but having teenage kids it was easy to see it as coming of age teenage angst. 

The revelations near the end of the book helped me further understand what Holden was going through and that this whole time there were much deeper things at play. 

I make a habit out of writing down my favorite quotes from books and what really left me feeling strange was that 2 of the 3 best quotes from the book (imo) come from a character that was likely a pedophile. It’s jarring. The teacher is presented to us as such a great guy but the author throws in a few red flags here and there until the big reveal of the head touching. Holden’s description of the guy made me like the character and at first made me shrug his actions off as a misunderstanding, but after finishing the book and really thinking about it more I really believe the teacher was a predator. The “handsome” comment bothered me on the first read and ends up being the nail in the coffin for me after more thought. At the end of the day, Holden has been abused before and we should likely trust his “radar” for these things. 

Another thing for me was not exactly understanding what Holden meant when telling his sister about the catcher in the rye. I looked at it as him just being a good person at heart and somebody that looks out for younger children, like his sister. But after finishing the book, it was much more apparent what he meant. It gave the catcher quote so much more needed context. His own past trauma influences his need to protect the children in the rye fields. 

The quotes for those interested:

“The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.”

“Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you.

Incidentally, the idea that he lacks empathy for those around him is quite at odds with my experience of the book.

iqhbls_12,iqhbls,"Sure! Here’s a bit from my first paragraph/thesis:

“While the concept of the flaneur was born in France in the 19th century, the flaneur has been continually reproduced and used as a literary figure. Such a reproduction may include Holden Caulfield, the main character of J.D. Salinger’s only novel *The Catcher in the Rye*, as Holden similarly traverses an urban city space as an active observer. However, despite Holden embodying key traits of the flaneur, his observation and engagement with his surroundings—people and place—are not born from an inherent longing to live and observe from within a transitory moment, but rather due to his adolescence. Holden does not thrive in or crave a state of flux like the flaneur. Holden is stuck within the mutable. His transition from child to adult requires a position within the luminal space of adolescence; Holden’s status as spectator is not a status that was chosen, setting him apart from the typical flaneur. Holden’s prescriptive observations (as opposed to a descriptive approach used by the flaneur), his longing for imagined, immutable spaces such as a museum or an Egyptian tomb, are characteristics unlike the flaneur. His position within and an observer of the crowd is not one of pleasure, but of circumstance.”

Please forgive my misspelling of flâneur I am on mobile and too lazy, lol. Also, this is a paper from college so grammar/development of ideas are a little rough. 

Basically, I was asked to explore whether Holden could be thought of as a flaneur: yes or no. However, I think the answer is more complicated than the question suggests (aren’t most questions involving literature?). 

Charles Baudelaire describes the flaneur as a figure who craves the instability of the ever-changing moment, especially that of an urban city space with continual modernization. The flaneur is most often male (even defined as such in earlier writings) due to his unique and privileged view of the world. A man can often move through spaces virtually unnoticed, often the subject, never the object (obviously this is not always true, but for my purposes here this is what I’m running with). When we think of depictions of women within urban spaces, we can easily sexualize them, describe what they are doing, categorize them (much like what Holden does to the various women he interacts with through the novel)—yet they are never the subject themselves. 

However, Holden is not himself a true flaneur (at least this is what I believe), as he is only within the ever-changing moment because he is an adolescent. Adolescence, I argued in the paper, is a liminal space between being the object of child (virtually no agency), and eventually the male adult, the subject (privilege and agency). 

I end the paper naming Holden a proto-flaneur: as a teen he is struggling with belonging and self-creation, meaning that his potential to be a flaneur is put into crisis by his inability to thrive and yearn for instability. He is constantly looking for the static, the safe, the unmoving (pay attention to how he interacts with spaces like the museum and especially his younger sister). While Holden certainly exists within the transitory, Holden actively rejects this space, and thereby rejects the role of the fully formed flaneur. 

I hope this was interesting! I love thinking about Holden’s relation to innocence and the unchanged as well as the powerful position that he can embody as a male teen/about-to-be adult. Much to say about the self-reflection he goes through while explaining this all to a mental-health professional, as well.

16qvziw_2,16qvziw,"Pasting a comment I made lately about this book:

""catcher is one of those books that drastically changes depending on where you are in life. As a teen you may identify or not with holden as a moody contrarian. As an adult though all I could see was a scared, confused, traumatized boy lashing out at the world. The Catcher in the Rye is one of my favorite books of all time and it's such a good litmus test for someone's ability to empathize. I understand Holden is annoying, but adults who outright hate him and don't understand why he is the way he is miss the fundamental point of the book. He's a damaged kid who's got nobody to help him. I mean, the people that think holden is just a selfish brat haven't even given a thought to the name of the book and what that means""

So yeah, not entirely addressing everything you mentioned but hopefully gives some reason for the love of the book. I particularly love the ending here. Holden is a damaged, neglected, lonely child who has been deemed irredeemable by the people around him, but he dreams of catching the kids lost in the same way he was. The ending elicits strong emotions because it's tragic that even after his trauma and abuse Holden just wants to be there for people who were unlucky enough to be caught in the same situation as him. He just wants to care and look after the innocent.",-Moonchild-,2023-09-24T12:54:58Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,2
16qvziw_3,16qvziw,"I think the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, presents and gives voice to something a lot of people (in the Western World) experience: alienation in the superficiality of abundance. I read the book as a critique of a society that is prosperous with few substantive relationships, because most people are selfishly engaged in their own pleasures and goals. 

In the book, Caulfield finds something “phony” in everything; realizing and ranting against the fact that he is (in his eyes) effectively constrained from doing anything worthwhile—he wants to write, but wouldn’t be allowed to write anything meaningful because society demands that art is entertainment, and even if he forwards his own expressions the audience wouldn’t be interested. 

The story is both about the disillusionment of realizing that others care for one less and less as they become more adult, and about the experience of personal struggles being ignored by others because those others choose to pursue their own interests, and/or are trammeled by conformity (like Caulfield’s absent parents). 

I think the book is very well-liked because it speaks to those who are emotionally alone in a rich society, and to those who have suffered trauma but can’t find a way to share that and receive support because nobody else really cares. What keeps *The Catcher in the Rye* from being simply a depressive book about jaded youth doing nothing, in my opinion, is the clear plea for someone to care, care truly about anything other than themselves: the need for any actual “catcher in the rye.”

For what it’s worth, Evelyn Waugh wrote funnier and more inspirational books on the same subject: if you can (and are interested) try something like *Decline and Fall*.",sworththebold,2023-09-24T20:46:27Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,3

I do believe the later in life you discover *The Catcher in the Rye*, the less impactful it might be, but regardless all young adults should give it a read in my opinion. It's a poignant, reflective novel that helps people who're afraid of and confused by the world around them realize they're not alone.

I’ve loved it ever since I read it in high school. My grandmother suffered from Alzheimer’s and I did not know how to process my grief at the fact, so I related a bit to Holden. The book just found me in the right time when I needed it. 

As a World War II historian, learning about Salinger’s experiences during the war has made me love it even more. Some parts were written while Salinger was in the field, and you can definitely see it as a coping mechanism of sorts. Holden’s desire to protect children from the cruelty of the world - can be argued that Salinger wants protect others from the cruelty and barbarity of warfare. Salinger was present at the Normandy Invasion on Utah Beach, The Battle of the Bulge, and entered Kaufering IV, one of the sub camps of Dachau. He was hospitalized for weeks after V-E Day because of stress. “For Esmé—with Love and Squalor” plays more into his wartime experiences, in addition to “Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters” and “A Perfect Day for Bananafish” but you see elements of it in Catcher as well. 

Also, in addition to dealing with absentee (or abusive) parents, the death of his brother, and sexual abuse, Holden also witnessed a classmate unalive themselves.

I read CitR when I was 23.  I've never identified with a book as deeply as I did with this one.  I come from a history of abuse, abandonment, neglect, and the death of my single mother from cancer when I was 14.  I had battled depression for as long as I could remember, and it was all coming to a head as I went through my early twenties.

I had spent years doing volunteer work, always trying to help other people.  It was as if I believed that if I could save them, maybe I could be saved too.  I had never realized why I felt so compelled to do it until I read Holden's idea of happiness, being the catcher in the rye.

It tore down all of my ideas of happiness and showed me that I had just been burying all of that darkness over and over again no matter how many times it resurfaced.  I stripped me away to almost nothing.  

I tried to kill myself a month after finishing this book but it was the best moment of my life.  In the midst of letting go of everything I realized I could let go of all that pain.  I realized that I was in control of me, and that all those things and people that hurt me, that took everything me were gone.  I realized that I was about to end it all on the doorstep of happiness and fulfillment.  I was about to make my survival worthless.

I've never read from a perspective that feels as genuine as Holden's. There's so much uncertainty, fear, and sadness that Holden carries with him about growing up that feels so genuine.

We see it when he goes to the museum, admiring how nothing would ever changes, but later despairing over the fact that even if the museum itself doesn't change, it wouldn't be the same because you would be changing and looking at it differently. We see it when Holden asks the taxi driver where the ducks go when the lake freezes over. Holden doesn't know how they cope with change.

We see it when he sees the ""Fuck you"" written on Phoebe's school walls and starts to worry about how the children will feel when they get sacred and wonder what it means and who wrote it. He imagines killing the person who wrote it, but he knows that no matter what he will never be able to protect them from every ""Fuck you"" written everywhere.

I think that there is also something very telling in the title of the book, ""The catcher in the rye"". Holden hears a little boy singing this poem to himself on the street and it makes him feel happy, though he doesn't know why. I searched up the origins of this poem and it's interesting to see that it actually has sexual origins, but the young boy who was singing the verses to himself actually gets the lyrics wrong and turns it into a light-hearted tune.

The whole sequence about trying to erase the graffiti with the curse words in case someone like his sister saw it related to this notion. I reread it recently and the unresolved mourning for his brother became the predominant theme for me. He's trying his absolute best to cope but it's just a bit too much for him, although he doesn't realise it. Another thing I noticed on the second reading is how likeable he is to the other characters, with a few exceptions. I was trying to work out what Holden's life went on to become and I'm pretty sure it all worked out for him. He's not stupid, he has a lot going for him. For someone like that, a lack of qualifications aren't going to hold him back, especially with the contacts his family and brother have. The way he thought about every situation he was in made me think it was either autobiographical of Salinger or perhaps Holden went on to become a writer like his brother.

He's actually a very loving and sensitive character and his youthful arrogance is a defence mechanism.",ApexElderRachidian3,2023-12-17T23:34:17Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1
xp90zc_1,xp90zc,"To help my classroom as seen above, we need support to buy 20 copies of Catcher In The Rye.  How can I remain sensitive to the anxiety, depression, and mental health issues that many of my students face (often undiagnosed)?  
These 16-year-old students are going to be studying Shakespeare's The Tragedy of Hamlet, The Prince of Denmark next semester. With this, I want to supplement their study of this difficult play about a young person, Prince Hamlet, likely suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after the sudden death of his father, with the study of a modern 16-year-old narrator in The Catcher in the Rye.

Junior year is especially when kids are trying to figure that out.  Holden so desperately wants a connection, but he so struggles for one.  The scene where he describes punching out the windows in the garage after Allie dies… I always say it’s a first “aha” moment about Holden. This kid is REALLY sad. Also his desire to preserve innocence- to be the catcher in the rye! Or when he says that he feels like he’s disappearing. I could go on and on.

1ramwo_1,1ramwo,"The Catcher in the Rye has been of particular interest to me  at rereadings  during separate stages in my life as an educator. I read it as a teenager who had been expelled from private college, again as a parent of adolescent children, and later still, as a teacher /administrator at a college. Each time I read the book I identified with a different sympathetic character. I was asked to leave private college at age 18. I took a few days before coming home to parents that were unaware of my expulsion. Later in life I sympathized with Holden's family. Finally, I have had to break the news to more than one young person that they could no longer attend the college their parents had entrusted to them. Even the fact that John Lennon's assasin, Mark David Chapman, was guided by insanity and The Catcher in the Rye  offers an uncomfortable connection to the book. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_David_Chapman

It wasn't something that was imposed upon me, and I was somehow completely oblivious about its cult following. I had taken a weekend shopping trip to the U.S. and was browsing through a thrift shop book shelf when I came across the book. I read a few pages and I liked what I had read so I decided to buy the book. I was a surprised that the clerk made a remark about the book, something about how  he didn't like it but that he knew of others who had equally loved it. I feel like the book just stumbled into my life for a reason. I was at the time 16 or 17 and the same age as Holden.  It's both an eerie and comforting feeling that no matter how old I become, Holden is eternally a teenager. What really resonated with me is Holden's view of children as symbols of innocence and purity, and how we lose sight of our faith and trust in humanity, as well as our ability to dream as we becoming adults.  The Little Prince is another book, or what I would regard as a children's book for adults, also touches upon some of this and more.",hannahlee09,2013-11-24T04:45:33Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,2

1ramwo_7,1ramwo,"Hi. American, 17 year-old teenager here. I can tell you that the ""new"" Catcher in the Rye is not Black Swan Green… For most teenagers today, our equivalent of Catcher in the Rye is just about any book by John Green — most notably, *Looking for Alaska* and/or *The Fault in our Stars*. 

*The Perks of Being a Wallflower* also deserves an honorable mention since I know a lot of people who enjoyed it (I did, too). 

The article seems to simply stereotype teenagers, instead of actually asking them about their reading habits. I know plenty of my peers who love *The Catcher in the Rye*. Sure, it's somewhat dated but nearly everyone says it's their favorite book that they've been required to read in school. Instead of asking teenagers about what they read and like, the article presumes that *Black Swan Green* is the ""new"" Catcher in the Rye simply because the journalist finds it to be more modern.

I think it's a beautiful novel, and I find Holden to be a very sympathetic character, even though he's a little shit. Holden is clearly a traumatized, emotionally disturbed kid, and his actions reflect this. As a character, he's been through a lot. The catcher in the rye metaphor is a profound way of explaining Holden's mindset. Him desperately wanting to stop others from losing their innocence, or grow up, because he is having trouble dealing with his emerging adulthood.

I started to guess the meaning of the words without looking them up. More and more. By the end of the book I could read much better and my understanding of the language skyrocketed. To this day this author and this book feel like home. A cozy comfortable feeling. Maybe I'm being subjective here but I believe that the Catcher in the Rye is a fantastic book, full of deep meaning.

I loved Holden. Holden is a person who cannot stand being lied to and refuses to lie. Not on the surface, on the inside. He sees the inside of people's relationships and it crushes him.

y23v1_1,y23v1,"I'm a little late to the party on this, but I wanted to share that I had sort of the opposite experience with the novel. When I read it at 14, I was so frustrated by Holden-- I remember my teacher saying that a lot of teenagers either identified with Holden or had sort of a literary crush on him, and feeling like that was such bullshit, because how could anyone be drawn to such an insufferable character? 


Then later I re-read the book, when I was in college, and realized that I had probably disliked Holden because I was unwilling to admit how much I could identify with him, when I was younger. In sort of an ironic hypocrisy, I had felt that Holden was phony because he was always on about how phony everyone else was. As a young adult re-reading the novel, I realized that yes, Holden WAS phony, and I had been, too, for expecting an impossible level of sincerity from everyone I encountered, including fictional characters. 


What I also saw when I re-read the book, and what made me fall in love with it as an adult, was the way Salinger was able to portray Holden's pain and desperation, his descent into (and struggle against) some kind of madness, without hitting the reader over the head with it. I think this is too often ignored when the novel is taught in high schools, because curricula tend to focus on the novel as a coming-of-age story, when really it is a story of a kind of fear and darkness that many teenagers do experience, but which usually doesn't consume them the way it does Holden. 


Anyway, as others have mentioned, I highly recommend you check out his lesser known work, and then re-read The Catcher in the Rye-- I think it will make it an even more rich experience for you. ",sally_jupiter,2012-08-12T00:31:39Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1
y23v1_2,y23v1,"I think people dislike it because they realize that at a time during their lives they were just as annoying, scared, and confused as Holden is. Holden is a kid that wants to to be a man but concurrently wants to maintain the innocence that children have. This is shown clearly in his love for his sister Phoebe and his deceased brother Allie. Salinger also writes Holden as a boy obsessed with death. Holden's admires death because he notices that it preserves the image of the person at the time of their death. Allie cannot grow up to be a phony like Holden's older brother because death makes that impossible. 
Salinger details the life of a depressed kid who doesn't know where he's going in life. The Catcher in the Rye is one of my favorite books because I'm in the same position as Holden, by that I mean I have no clue where I'm going in life.

What it was, it was Mr. Antolini’s hand.

When something perverty like that happens, I start sweating like a bastard. •••That kinda stuff’s happening to me about twenty times since I was a kid•••””

And apparently this teacher DRUGED him. When Holden gets in the apartment, he claims to be very awake, but right after the tea, he gets sleepy and sleepy and sleepy, waking up to his teacher touching his head, half naked. And at the next morning he feels shaky and vomits multiple times, showing that he, indeed was drugged.

And that’s why he is the catcher in the rye. He wants to protect children from ever being through the kinds of things he has. He wants to protect them from falling off the cliff.

I imagine a kid like that was often scrutinized and alienated since he didn't fit America's ideal of an obedient, well-adjusted young man.  
  
With that said, it's clear Mr. Caulfield is a lost kid struggling with loss and uncertainty. It's easy to write Houlden off as a whiny, rich white boy. I did for a time, but I came to appreciate what Houlden brought to YA fiction. He made teenagers worthy character studies. He gave a voice to the voiceless and still does.

jinb0y_2,jinb0y,"32. Just finished. Now my favorite book. 

I think age probably affects the reader’s interpretation to a large degree. Was gonna give my copy to my 12 year old son but I think I’ll hold off until he’s older.

Edit: Came back to touch on some discourse I see online surrounding the book and this also elaborates my original point. I see a lot of opinions claiming Holden was whiny and a brat. But in seemingly unnoticed ironic fashion, lots of these opinions sound whiny and bratty. I could see how he would come off that way to a teenage crowd. Even his friends disregard his frequent philosophical musings. His brain was not “typical” of a “normal” teenager. He didn’t want to be down at the big football game, he had all that trauma going on etc. and while this could be waved away as “teenage angst” there was a whole lot more going on there. He had real life shit happen to him and tbh I don’t think Salinger began to scratch the surface of it all, albeit intentionally, because it wasn’t in Holdens nature to be terribly reminiscent or vulnerable. I also wanted to point out a comment I saw in this thread. Someone said they didn’t really appreciate the book as a child, but read it in college and was brought to tears. I cried 3 times reading it. 

>!First two times were when Holden cried. The last was when Phoebe pulled up with her briefcase.!<

I think as an adult you can empathize more with Holden because you see him as a child who sorely needs guidance and desires an unattainable peace of mind. As a child, you may view him as being annoying because he’s supposed to be the older cool kid but he’s not. Also, without going through tragedy yourself and navigating through the perilous mental turmoil and nihilism that is so common afterward, which many young people are lucky to not have experienced yet, he will be harder to understand. This may sound strange, but many times throughout my life I had finally got around to enjoying a piece of content, a book a movie, a song, whatever, that I was familiar with for decades through title alone. And it was only after finishing that I would realize that had I attempted to take in that content in my youth, I would have grossly misinterpreted and under appreciated it.. it feels very preordained at times. Like things come across my path at the perfect stage in my life where my consciousness was in a particularly specific state designed for maximum enjoyment of that content. I mean, my last name is Holder and to this day I still get called that sometimes at work. That created an immediate connection between me and Holden. The way he described becoming too excited at times when he finally found himself in a conversation he actually enjoyed, I just became aware of that in myself, I happen to actually be from New York, Holdens descriptions of Pencey reminded me of my time in the Army etc, among many other subtle similarities. Anyway, 

To answer OPs question, 

>!the Catcher was a reference to a poem. Holden misinterpreted the poems meaning to fit his perception of the world. That was a truly remarkable detail introduced by the author and it kind of goes with everything I said before. He wanted to be the Catcher in the Rye to protect children, signifying he probably wished he could be caught if he fell (and also highlights his unprocessed grief for his brother and classmate). But his kid sister Phoebe, who was the one who corrected him in his mistaking of the poems lyrics, elucidated “the point” of the book in the last scene. Holden eased his concern for her safety by resolving that you can’t always protect children. If they fall reaching out for something they truly desire, you have to let them go for it.!<
You’re welcome.

Side note: banning this book conjures a word in my mind that starts with an r that is no longer politically correct. You can talk about grabbing women by the .. and be the President of the whole god bless-ed United States but the pitchforks come out over references to making out, prostitution, atheism and underage drinking. This country is so ass backwards sometimes.",ConsciousDirection69,2024-01-15T12:37:02Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,2
3hy7so_1,3hy7so,"The thing about the Catcher in the Rye is a lot about the times, yes.  These times went on for 30-40 years after and current young people don't feel the same way, no.  People younger than myself are already acclimated completely to this changed society immediately and don't understand the stulting normalcy that was forced on you in the 50-80s. 

The norm now is to be your own your own person and that is great.  The norm back then was to conform to a *super* rigid cultural ideal of what it meant to be a person.  Holden Caufield wanted to catch people in the rye before they got to this cultural norm.  It's impossible to translate to this day and age in a lot of ways.  

Imagine that there was only one way of being right now and everyone had to get to that and aspire to be that.  A counter-culture forms saying, ""Bullshit I will go my own way.""  Catcher in the Rye described that ideal, that mentality and that process perfectly for the time.

Now we understand that counter-culture and these ideals are automatically co-opted back into the norm and this has been going on for *decades*.  Imagine a time before this where Madonna, Prince, George Michael and this book were *truly* **truly** shocking and there was debate about them being allowed at all.  Then think of the modern context with Kanye, Gaga, 50 shades of Grey being normal things. People like them were inconceivable to most of us back then (we were busy deciding to ban George Michael for Father Figure, Madonna for everything, Prince for everything). 

So to answer your question, to a lot of us old fuddyduddies, Catcher is a cultural turning point, a revelation of fighting against the norm.  The definition of norm has changed from one specific vision of reality (the house, the suburbs, the wife, the two kids, the car) to include almost all manners of human existence. You have to understand how many people wouldn't accept any of what was going on now at all 30 years ago (tattoos, piercings, dyed hair, the music, the porn, the language, etc.)  Holden's refusal to mature for the sake of childish creativity was a harbinger of the creativity that came after (didn't cause it but it lead a lot of people to open their mind to a new world).

You generations after mine are already open to this.  Imagine your mind closed and this book came out.  Imagine the world seeming really small and you wanted something else.

3hy7so_2,3hy7so,"Agreed. It is very important to place books within the cultural norm of the time period in which it was written. The author was influenced by that which he saw happening around him and it filtered into his work. 

When reading a book like Pride and Prejudice you are constantly reminded that the story takes place in a different time period, under different social conventions. The word usage alone appears slightly foreign to us. This constantly reminds you as reader that things were different back then and that you shouldn't (completely) judge the characters and actions based on modern standards.

It is however very easy to overlook the fact that Catcher in the Rye was written in a significantly different social time period than we currently live in. Partly because all the surroundings and social conventions are recognizable to us. The language used in the book is also similar to current language usage. To judge the Catcher in the Rye by today's standards of what is shocking is unfair to the book. When placing it within the correct social/time context would be a lot more fair to the book.

My entire life the ""correct"" way to speak, think, even feel where all scripted for me. I was responsible for preforming above and beyond, yet whatever I did became the basis for the lowest bar, so say I won a competition, I was expected to enroll and compete in a higher level and if I did worse at the higher level than I did at the lower level I was shamed by the entire family. ie: I played basketball in a city league in the 6th grade, then was expected to try out for the state level team. I wasn't that good at basket ball and failed to make the top team in the state.  That christmas you could have thought I shot grandma the way the aunts and uncles wouldn't stop mentioning it. Sympathy is seen as the lowest level of attrition, so there was no end of for the entire night.

mjejhu_1,mjejhu,"J.D Salinger's experience in WW2 really shaped how Holden is portrayed in the book. I think the book is elevated when knowing that information going into it.

What Holden goes through and the feelings he has, are related to Salinger's return from war and how that experience effected him. The alienation he felt from the rest of society, seeing things that human eyes should never have to glance at, bring people to extremes.

It's interesting to note that J D Salinger was very much interested in Buddhism and specifically the Zen branch. There is a critical analysis of the The Catcher in the Rye which I once read that very logically detailed how the book had a subtext where Holden's experience in the book was a metaphor for the life of Buddha.

hacjq8_1,hacjq8,"I set about reading ""the classics"" a few years ago and The Catcher in the Rye made the list.  Once thing I found from my readings was that some classics are genuinely fantastic books, some are not and are limping along on pseudo philosophical analysis where people are obviously not comfortable stating they did not care for the book that everyone else is also pretending they loved.

Catcher is in the latter category.  it's devoid of anything you'd call a ""plot"".  it's more of a narrative ""a day in the life of an asshole"".  Narration starts, stuff happens, narration stops.

the oddest take away I found in the book was how integral Salinger considered cigarette smoking to be to the  story.

  Holden just wants to live as a woman sex worker, having sex with random people and ""catching"" random sexual diseases, ""rye"" was, in European litterature, frequently an innuendo about the pubic hair, most usually - a women's pubic hair. 


This is my idea about ""The Catcher in the Rye"".


Now,  there are *people*, who say, that Holden is a heterophobic homosexual with an ephebophilia fetish, who wants to seduce or ""corrupt"" younger heterosexual partners, and considering Holden's age at that point - this is just criminal, and guide the young and the inexperienced, running towards the ""ravine"" (vagina), into the warm and welcoming bosom of his bum-bum,  instead, but I say this is ascribing intent to an author and skirts too close to the predjudiced image of yesteryear's ""pederast"".",TheYearOfThe_Rat,2021-08-08T09:50:28Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1

Franny and Zooey is actually much shorter than The Catcher in the Rye (by almost a 100 pages). And it's also very simple to follow, as The Catcher in the Rye follows Holden through a lot of places and deals with quite a bit of other characters and storylines, while Franny and Zooey takes place almost entirely in one area and centers primarily on only two characters and one storyline.

I guess the only thing I can understand is that it was rare to see books marketed to young adults at that time, and not even about that topic, so that's why it was popular, but now we celebrate the book more (I think) about the writing and content rather than it being the first of it's kind.

They tried to get out for a while like Caulfield and they realize that they cannot entirely do that for some reasons and they settle for conformity instead but not to the point of losing their individuality.

I am like him from time to time, always questioning the world. Sure, The Catcher in the Rye maybe boring to some and Caulfield seems like a whiny jerk.

sjc1s_1,sjc1s,"The thing about *Catcher* that people invariably do not acknowledge when they are discussing Holden on /r/books is that there are **two different Holden Caulfields;** there is the Holden telling the story and the Holden about whom the story is being told. Holden has gone out west to stay with his brother after all of this madman stuff happened to him after he was kicked out of Pency and a year later he is sitting down to reflect, but also to tell the readers his story. Holden throughout the entirety of the book is reflecting on himself, the things that he did and the person that he was one year ago.

Holden isn't meant to be likeable, but that's not to say that he isn't loveable. Him sitting down one year later to tell us his story about misunderstanding what it meant to be a catcher in the rye and all, is redemptive. Holden is a character who is being consumed by his coming of age and it's a time in his life, a time in most of our lives when we aren't very likable people. I know I was as cantankerous of a 16 year old as they come and I'm sure many of you could say the same about yourselves. Unlike so many books *Catcher* isn't a book about someone you want to be like or someone you want to be with it's a book about someone you are, or someone you were. It's about protecting ourselves from the inexorable march into adulthood and the futility of that pursuit. If you are just reading *Catcher* and thinking about it within the context of the Holden about whom the story is being told it's a terribly sad story, but if you expand your reading to the Holden narrating I think, I hope, you might find something enjoyable about it. 

It takes a lot for this kid to sit down and tell us everything he went through, the stuff with Sunny, the questions he asks of the cab driver, the fact that when he goes to ""give someone a buzz"" he looks through his phone book and has nobody to call (it'd be like you scrolling through your cell phone contacts and realizing there is no one, not a single person on that list who wants to talk to you), Allie's death... these are really intimate things for Holden to just be sharing with us in conversation, and ultimately that's what *Catcher* is, a conversation and what's a conversation but a chance to crawl inside the head of someone else, for better or worse. The beauty of *Catcher* is that Holden has found a way to make us care (or at least give us the opportunity to care or not). Through creating this text and having this conversation with the reader he has found an audience, someone who will empathize with him; through text Holden has done what he couldn't get anyone to do while he was living the story he is now telling. That's why *Catcher* is worthwhile and beautiful and worth reading, it gives us an opportunity to empathize with Holden and it exemplifies the power of written language. 

**tl;dr There are two Holdens in *The Catcher in the Rye* and if you only read it thinking about one of them you're gonna have a bad time.**

sjc1s_2,sjc1s,"You know, The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye are actually kind of similar, now that I think about it. The Great Gatsby is heavily centered around Gatsby holding onto a wishful, imaginary version of who he perceives to be a “pure, innocent” girl. This girl being someone he used to be in love with. Years and years later and still, he continues to devote his life to impressing this girl because he is obsessed with his mental image of this “pure, innocent”, “perfect” girl. Whereas in The Catcher in the Rye, Holden is obsessed with the idea of saving “innocent, pure” children from “monstrous” puberty, as you can see when he tells Phoebe about wanting to devote his life to saving imaginary children from falling off of an imaginary cliff. The two books have different messages, though; The Great Gatsby is about not idealizing a person, and The Catcher in the Rye speaks about the preservation of innocence, as well as many other things.

Funnily, if Holden met Gatsby, the man with a mansion meant to simply impress a girl, he would hate “the phony”.",Throwawayaccount3374,2023-12-11T00:19:56Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,2
22ma25_1,22ma25,"I think for me, in high school, it was the perfect example of a kid trying to deal with growing up, letting go and dealing with things probably beyond his maturity level. To be honest though and I know this is r/books but Holden's story was re imagined in a way more interesting light (to me at least) in a movie called Igby Goes Down. It's great you should see it. The best thing about The Catcher in the Rye is that it opens up the reader to the rest of Salinger's work and he was AMAZING.

22ma25_2,22ma25,"There's also the issue of its historical significance. 

When THE CATCHER IN THE RYE came out, the genre that we now call ""Young Adult"" was nearly nonexistent. Back then, there were adult books and children's books. Nothing truly chronicled the ""teenage experience."" (You can probably argue that the idea of a teenage didn't come into its full maturity until the 1950s.) It was preceded by THE OUTSIDERS, which also showed teenagers as different from children and adults. 

Holden still serves as the prototypical teenager: sullen, cynical, searching for authenticity. Not all teengers are like this, but this personality type resonates with a lot of people. Who hasn't felt like they are surrounded by phonies at one point?

Plus, you know, the writing is good. ",db282,2014-04-10T23:25:39Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,2

bspuc4_1,bspuc4,"you mentioned that he’s an unreliable narrator, and that complicates the points you’re trying to make right there.

individual points can sound sinister when extrapolated from the whole, their context.  

there WAS trauma...trauma Holden hasn’t been able to really confront:  the death of his sibling.  is he confronting it from the place he’s writing this recollection from?

the antolini thing is left ambiguous.  the guy could just have been affectionate, and holden misread less innocent motivations into it.  the whole book is also a tale of a kid becoming sexually aware and not sure how to integrate the experience yet (let alone cope with the death of his sibling).  he’s not quite a child, and he’s not quite an adult yet.  does he ever get any normal affection from his rich parents?  it doesn’t seem so.  someone showing care, concern, and nurturing (like a normal parent) probably seems weird to him...because he spends most of his time describing the adult world as phony.  no adult could be genuine.

where do the ducks go?  where do they go when the water freezes?

it’s a tale of coping, adapting.

he’s not grooming phoebe so much as mimicking his idea of parenting.  and it’s interesting this child on the carousel is the last place he visits in his story, his memory.  notice he doesn’t ride with her.  he stands with the adults.  

whatever sexual/adult details he notices, he’s completely clunky at socially integrating.  he wants to be the catcher in the rye, but he even gets the lyric wrong!",bogart_on_gin,2019-05-25T12:14:40Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1
gmrkhv_1,gmrkhv,"So, *The Catcher in the Rye* is one of my favorites and I love it more every time I read it. For me, I think it deals with something pretty universal, which is the challenge of stepping out of adolescence and finding your place in the adult world. This is Holden’s struggle in the book: he doesn’t know where he fits in and doesn’t know how to go forward. (Spoilers for people who have not read the book.)

>!Remember the scene in the museum when Holden goes back and someone has written “fuck you” on the exhibit? That’s the point of the book: he’s trying to hold on to adolescence, but he can’t because the world says “no, fuck you.” He *has* to move into adulthood, but Holden has a lot of things keeping him trapped in his childhood/adolescence; grief from the death of his brother that he never got over, possible abuse, witnessing the death of a classmate, etc. He struggles to move forward into adulthood but is held back, so he just ends up “performing” what he thinks adulthood looks like by hiring a prostitute, going out for drinks, etc.!<


People usually complain that Holden is a whiny, privileged, oblivious, brat. He is. That’s the point. I’m pretty sure most of us were self-centered and whiny when we were Holden’s age, at least a little bit. I know I was. There’s some philosopher that said something like “be kind, everyone is fighting a battle you cannot see.” Holden is fighting the battle of finding your place in the world, the same that *every* person has or will have to fight. And, yes, he has advantages in the battle. But he has disadvantages, too.

>!It’s pretty heavily implied that Holden is dictating the book to a medical professional of some kind. So as the book is happening, he’s losing the battle, or at least he feels like he is. And maybe he feels like he *can’t* find a place in the world. Which is why he wants to be the “catcher in the rye.” To keep the kids safe in their childhood, so they don’t have to deal with the struggle and disillusionment that he has had to deal with.!<


The book is not really about plot/action, it’s about Holden trying to come to terms with all of this. To me, the universalness of Holden’s story, of trying to find your place as an adult in the world (and the disillusionment that usually accompanies that time) makes the book worth reading. It’s something I think everyone can relate to in some way. And then Salinger intentionally gives us an unlikeable protagonist as a challenge, to make us see that *everyone* (even the privileged, whiny brats) is searching for a place that they belong in the world.

But, I’m not an expert, and that’s just my two cents!",okiegirl22,2020-05-19T17:13:51Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1

It's not innocence in my understanding its naiveness which is more miserable. You cant be a man and not accept you want sex. You cant be a man and not accept you have bad intentions sometimes. It can  all goes terribly wrong when you are not honest with yourself. The point ot the book for me is that you get to see what a person looks like before it all goes terribly wrong.

izua8l_1,izua8l,"I'm surprised the book isn't more relatable to a younger generation of readers. Holden is cynical of the world, run by phonies, and pessimistic about the future. He's an idealist who wants the world to be safe and happy for everyone, and dreams of being the person who can make it that way -- be the catcher in the rye, saving all the children. He's also not honest and is the classic unreliable narrator of his own story.

When I was in high school many years ago I could relate, I could see disillusioned people like Holden among my classmates, angry with the world and without a clear direction. Of course that wasn't *me*, I could take comfort in that. I could have looked in the mirror and convinced myself (with some smug pride) that *I'm* not Holden Caulfield, and probably fool my friends as well. Which is about the most Holden Caulfield thing I could have done.

I see a lot of disillusioned, cynical young people today, upset by the failures of the older generation, wanting very much to make the world better, but without a clear direction. That's why I am surprised it's not relatable in 2020.

For me I think the ""take away"" is that this is a coming of age story in which a cynical idealist realizes he is going to have to go forth in world anyway, and accept the truth that he can't save everyone and can't fix the problems he sees in the world. If he becomes more self-aware he might realize he can fix himself.",codece,2020-09-25T23:30:38Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1

I am just about heading off to bed, so I'm not going to go into this too much, but I'll leave you with this:  At Chapman's trial in June of 1981 after he plead guilty to the murder, he was asked if there was anything else he wanted to say.  He stood up and read a passage from ""The Catcher in the Rye"" when Holden tells his sister Phoebe what he wants to do with his life.

That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.""

2b03c4_2,2b03c4,"I got up this morning and I was totally geeking out that someone was interested to hear more about this!

OK, so basically the reason Chapman chose that passage to read tells us two very important things about his connection with Holden Caulfield as well as his motives for the murder.

Chapman did in fact very much relate to Holden Caulfield (so much so that he made a pretty extensive effort to emulate him, I'll get to that in a bit) but in his mind Lennon did not represent all the ""big phonies"" that Caulfield so despises.  Rather, Lennon is represented by Phoebe, Caulfield's kid sister (and all the other innocent kids Holden sees in the book).

If you notice in the book, all the adults are big phonies but all the children are innocent.  The whole theme in this book is ""loss of innocence"" and in the passage which Chapman chose to read, we see that Holden does not want to accept the reality of this.  Being the catcher in the rye is basically standing around all day stopping those sweet kids from growing up.  

Now, obviously John Lennon was nowhere near innocent at the time of his death, but in Chapman's mind, he was.  Chapman was a *huge* fan of John Lennon, and did not want him to become corrupted by fame (he already was) and probably in a way Chapman wanted Lennon for himself.  He did not want Yoko to have him, nor Julian, nor Sean, and certainly not any of the music producers.  (That last bit is purely my own speculation and has never been stated by Chapman.)

One of my favorite creepy similarities about this whole thing is that the night before the murder, Chapman called a prostitute to his room, and she was wearing a green dress.  Did he request that she wear it?  I don't actually know.  Rumor has it they did not have sex, but merely talked, which would be exactly in line with the book.  

This is all that's really coming to mind off the top of my head, but it really is a cool topic (speculation or not).  [This article](http://theamericanscholar.org/on-first-looking-into-chapmans-holden-speculations-on-a-murder/#.U8n12uNdUoE) is a great read which is sort of more on my side of the whole thing.

Then there's [this one](https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/mark_david_chapman_the_catcher_in_the_rye_and_the_killing_of_john_lennon) which supports the theory that Chapman viewed Lennon as a corrupter of innocence.  (Sometimes I think I believe the first theory just because I like Lennon so much and want to think of him as good.)

Also, I'll just throw this on here for fun, in my hometown there is this crazy mofo who drives around in his van all painted with LENNON MURDER TRUTH across the side.  His name is Steve Lightfoot and he believes that Mark Chapman is actually Stephen King and that the murder is a huge conspiracy involving Nixon, Reagan, and others.  Really far out stuff, but you've got to hand it to the guy, he's kept this website up and running for years and he's got a compelling (if not ridiculous) argument.  Check it out [here](http://lennonmurdertruth.com/).

zyl85v_1,zyl85v,"You missed so much of what 'Catcher really addressed by trying to view it through a historical lens, (which Salinger was not privy to) rather than the over-arching message of abandonment and its effects on a fragile youth trying to claim manhood without support or attachment to anything but his little sister (childhood). He loses a sibling and becomes invisible to his parents afterward. The only attention he gets is negative attention, the only praise he gets comes from a teacher (at least one, though he alludes to others) that is likely grooming him for sex. In all of them he sees a general falsity, a ""phoniness"" that grows the distance between him and others, again, except his sister who is still genuine in her pristine youth, a youth lost to him now that his eyes are open.  What you call ""whiny"" is simply the voice of a kid groping about for some meaning and connection, but failing, until he finally steps off the curb and falls into an oblivious state of nervous collapse.  Its allegorical and as such, exaggerated, but its the journey between youth and adulthood that's being addressed, not hippie culture or the boomer generation or evangelicals.  The title itself should be a clue.  Holden wants to be ""The Catcher in The Rye"", a vision he made up after misunderstanding the lyrics to an old folk song.

fassdk_1,fassdk,"I suggest reading Franny and Zooey by Salinger next. It expands on that idea, particularly using the character Franny as a sort of Holden 2.0 (it's also just a great book and my fav from Salinger). 


Like Holden, Franny gets that obsession with how phony everyone and everything is, but unlike him she has a strong support system that knows what she's dealing with and can steer her towards the right answers (basically a family of  Antolinis). 


Throughout ""Catcher"", Holden is alone with his thoughts and while he is ""correct"" about somethings and has a reason to think what he does, he needs someone to bounce off of and who can bring him down to Earth. Antolini doesn't really have the time to give him the guidance he needs, but the advice he gives is the core of what Holden needs. 


While Holden is disillusioned, what he really needs is a set ideology and to think about what he wants to do (aka what he ""wants to live for""). In my mind Holden is a creative, but hasn't realized it yet (maybe an Actor or Director). Which is what  Antolini is trying to tell him to take the time to realize. This feeling of aimlessness is one many youths deal with and is why this book is so relatable in the formative years.


Antolini says, ""The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one."" Basically, I feel, Holden should go back to school like Antolini suggests because that is where he'll probably find that thing that draws him in and that he wants to dedicate his life to. In the real world, that is what usually happens. Some people know what they want to be from an early age, but many, like Holden, are particularly aimless throughout High School and then go to College studying what they think they should until they're exposed to that one thing that they feel they're truly meant to do. That's the period Holden is in and it's an excruciatingly dull one. But, his thoughts throughout the book shows a thinker with great potential and Antolini sees that and tries to help ignite a spark with his advice.


Once again, Franny and Zooey uses these themes beautifully, and has more defined questions and answers. Also, a character in Franny and Zooey is suggested to have written ""The Catcher in the Rye"" making it a book-in-a-book. But, the most important thing to pull from that idea is that the character from Franny and Zooey wrote about Holden because he has knowledge of that thought process. And, when you read it, you'll definitely see how the struggles of Holden can relate to the struggles of being a Glass Family member.

Holden acts out because he is still dealing with the death of his brother.  He hasn't been able to process it because his parents keep sending him to boarding schools instead of connecting with him.  It's also implied that he's been sexually abused. This leads him to distrust adults and push away ones who seem to genuinely care, like Mr. Antolini. He also over values childhood innocence, which is shown by him not realizing his little sister is more mature than he thinks (and slightly more mature than him) and when he imagines his ideal job based on a misinterpretation of a risque poem.  Holden sees the world as phony, predatory, and without value.

rr58xg_1,rr58xg,"One of my top five best reads ever.   I first read it when I was about the same age as Holden Caufield back in the 1980's and I completely identified with Holden's mental struggles.  This is a testament to Salinger's writing ability because my situation in life was different than Holden's.  Holden was rich and had all of the advantages in life.   I was poor and had no advantages.   But we shared a common view when it came to social interaction.   I too saw most people as ""phonies"" and had developed a cynical view of the world. Now, as a much older person,  I realize that I was really searching for meaningful human interaction and wasn't getting it. 

Perhaps finding The Catcher in the Rye was more meaningful to me so long ago because it was before the internet and social media existed, and it was a time when mental health issues did not get the attention they deserve. I felt like I had a kindred spirit to connect with in Holden.  Holden was suffering from a form of PTSD due to the death of his younger brother, and he was not getting the type of counseling that he needed from his friends or elders. I too had suffered trauma that was not being addressed in the proper way,  and I suffered in silence as I was not aware how to begin to help myself. And so I ostracized myself from others,  like Holden.

I think too that a modern reader must put this into historical perspective.   Salinger was writing just after World War 2 at a very ""macho"" time in American culture.  Boxing was a more popular sport than professional football for example.  Soldiers returning from the horrors of war with mental struggles had virtually no recourse. If they couldn't ""handle"" normal life,  they were put in the ""nut house"" and subjected to treatments that we find cruel today (hydro treatments,  electric shock,  etc.).  So to successfully address mental illness in a sensitive manner was a tremendous  achievement for Salinger.",ericmsandi,2021-12-29T18:22:32Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1
opdtt2_1,opdtt2,"I'll give my take on why paragraphs were needed.

I read the title and since I read the book I'm interested how others perceived it. I begin to read the body of the essay:

>The Catcher in the Rye follows the story of a young boy called Holden Caulfield over a period of two days after \[...\]

At this point I'm bored. I've read the book and and can summarize it myself. I skip the summary of the plot and jump to your first argument, but instead of the argument, I get the final conclusion. Where is the argument? Just to make sure I start to read a random sentence in the middle of the big paragraph and sure enough, your arguments are buried in the summary. Paragraphs help readers skip irrelevant parts.

Even if the reader wants to read each and every word, paragraphs help the audience to make sense of what the sentences are trying to do. For example, in the argumentative essay format the text is split in 5 paragraphs and the reader knows how to read each of them. If all the text is merged into a giant paragraph, the reader might get confused if they are still reading the first argument or maybe it's already the argument #3.

Dividing things into paragraphs also helps the writer to review their own work. Neatly divided paragraphs can tell at a glance if an argument is too short or too long.

P.S. One thing I found a bit troubling:

>And also I wrote this on my phone without the intention of structuring it   
like I would an essay. So to talk about paragraphs on Reddit is kind of   
like saying always use full stops when texting.

When you submit your essays in school/uni, it's going to be ready by only one person, who is paid to read it. If you are sloppy and break all the rules, only one person has to suffer.

Just today I was watching a video on the book and the person basically said that the book is about a boy that hates everything and things he's a grown up because he's a teenager. And also how bad of a person he was. I just can't look at Holden that way, the book was about processing trauma, dealing with trauma and it was beautifully captured in my opinion. Even more I think he's a very self aware character, at least more than is granted him - as in the scene where he describes to his sister that he wants to be the catcher in the rye, catch the ones in the rye so that they don't fall off the cliff because he already has and he knows what it does to you etc (which is definitely a reference to Salinger going to the army quite young) - I liked the scene where he was in the cab and asked the driver about the ducks, and where they go when the waters frozen, at first I didn't really look into it but I think its kind of that he never gets the answers from authority figures that he wishes for instead he is hurt by them (as you already mentioned, CSA etc.) - sorry for the long reply",redditeury,2021-10-12T21:50:38Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1

qbyzw9_4,qbyzw9,"I usually don't hate books. I love even the worst of fanfics, as long there's some form of skill in it. At worst, I just lose interest and that's it. But for me, the one book I hate with every fibre of my being is *The Catcher in the Rye.*

I'm not American, but I **adore** American or wartime literature, or anything that has to do with very detailed settings, or anything realistically historical. I appreciate *The Great Gatsby,* my favorite play is *All My Sons,* I read the entirety of *War and Peace,* cover to cover. I've written literature papers in school for all of them. Tolkien is my patron deity of fantasy, Verne's *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea* is my all-time inspiration for writing and adventure. Eoin Colfer was a nice teenage memory, reading Artemis Fowl.

I have a general dislike of Stephen King's writings because I find his books boring rather than suspenseful, but that's just me. He's a good writer, otherwise. Rowling was my favorite fantasy writer until Cursed Child made me physically vomit. R.R. Martin was overrated to me but I can appreciate his skill. I fall asleep at James Patterson's writing. Dan Brown's writing was forgetful to me. I have read countless fanfics in my time that when I think back on it, has made me physically recoil. I have **written** fanfics as a kid that when I think back on it, has made me take asprin.

All of it is nothing compared to the utter and absolute contempt and hatred I have of *Catcher in the Rye.*

A whiny little bitch like Holden made me want to see him at the ending, where he was looking at his sister enjoy herself and started to feel less of a pathetic little prick that he was, see his sister fall off the carousel and fall into a coma. I wanted to see him suffer an actual goddamn tragedy for once in his teenage life that isn't filled with some drivel about how sad or cool or whatever he is. I wanted to see him really suffer.

And for that, while I hate it with every fiber of my being, J.D Salinger may be the only writer I have ever read that made me outright **hate** the character. I could barely read through the first chapter without just abandoning the book. If it wasn't part of my Literature course I would never have read it past the first chapter.",DisbelWaetl,2021-10-20T16:12:59Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,4

89mw4l_1,89mw4l,"The Catcher in the Rye is one of my favourite books of all time and I've read it every year since I was 17. The older I get, the more I notice and appreciate. I think Holden exemplifies that type of teenager who has a hard time accepting the fact that sooner or later they're going to have to join the adult world when they find that world so confusing and phony. It was and still is something I struggle with so I definitely felt Holden was very relatable and as a teenager I found it comforting to know I wasn't alone in that feeling. 

I think it's also pretty clear that Holden is struggling with feelings of depression and anxiety given the loss of his brother Allie and his general anxieties about growing up. I always feel a great deal of sympathy for Holden but I've heard a lot of people describe him as being very whiny and unlikable. Teenagers generally are pretty whiny and unlikable, especially ones who are struggling. Holden isn't meant to be Edward Cullen or Harry Potter. The Catcher in the Rye is the kind of book I keep thinking about after I've finished. I really hope Holden was okay in the end and I like to think he and Jane met again.

9mfxa_1,9mfxa,"My brother's reading the catcher in the rye now for high school and we've been talking about it.  I had read it as a freshman in high school and identified with Holden pretty hard.  7 years after the fact, I came into our conversations thinking that I didn't like the book anymore because I don't feel like Holden Caulfield, but I was wrong.

I think the Catcher is a worthy read because it successfully places the character of Holden Caulfield into a world in such a whole, convincing way that the reader, rather than getting the sense that JD Salinger approves or disapproves of Holden, will feel about Holden much the way they would about the questions that Holden has already answered.

The best example of the way that I read the book now comes through in an episode that takes place in the middle of the book, when all of the sudden Holden wants to run away from his life with Sally and they would live together and later they would get married and he would chop the wood for them in the winter and everything.

as Holden describes this situation in the first person, it is clear that he has all of these unreasonable expectations of Sally and that he doesn't think through how these expectations would apply to himself.  because Sally isn't as stressed out about the whole world and how messed up it is the way that Holden is, she doesn't really want to run away from everything.  Instead of understanding how subjective his point is and how out of left field the proposition is for Sally, Holden describes her as being pissed off and unreasonable.  Sally tells him he's yelling and Holden tells the reader that he wasn't yelling, and it becomes clear that he is unreliable as a narrator.

The way that I read in high school is still the easiest way for me to read today, that is, to totally identify with the main character and become absorbed in their world.

The problem is that in a book like the Catcher in the Rye, the point of the book is to understand Holden from the author's point of view, rather than his own.

[Edit one year on: I would put this differently. I would say that the way the The Catcher in the Rye is written, the reader doesn't learn what JD Salinger thinks of people like Holden, the reader sees what *they* think about a person like Holden Caulfield.  

As a youngster, I thought he was hilarious and honest.  Recently, I found him to be someone who shares many of my bad qualities, (a terrible listener when it matters most, very little perspective on or warmth towards life and the world).  Maybe there's one thing that's objective about Holden, he's a nervous person, who doesn't know for sure what he wants out of life.  I think it reflects the quality of writing that I could read the language of the story as a sympathizer and think JD was in my corner, then 7 years later take the same words and feel as though Salinger is making an argument for why I think Holden is scary and sad.]",TheFrigginArchitect,2009-09-21T01:36:48Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1

I've read many books but only a few has impacted me the same as Rye. Slaughterhouse 5, Lolita, Animal farm, 1984 and maybe The brother Karamazov, would be those. They have the same ""feel"". Perhaps you should wait till summer with Karamazov, It requires so much energy and focus. But so worth it.

Holden’s angst and dissatisfaction with those around him is super relatable imo; and his desire to become the catcher in the rye (and other instances, like his inability to get freaky with the hooker) speaks to complying with gender norms and expectations, which is a big deal even today! His eventual conformity makes for an interesting element as well: he gives in, he becomes the phony.

They might have been wrong coming from someone like him, but without focusing too much on him, I think he said some valid things that probably needed to be said, whether that was the intended point by Salinger or not. Then you have the whole thing where it boils down to adulthood and the struggle of conformity, when all you really wanna do is save the freedom from fear of judgement, freedom from fear of failure, freedom to speak your mind, etc that you experience as a child. The Catcher In The Rye as a whole was a book with many valid points which I hadn’t seen discussed very in-depth before. Well, honestly, Catcher didn’t even go very in-depth.

I'm not sure I agree. The book is about a very damaged individual who is lashing out at a world because he's hurt, confused, and scared. He's narrating this book from a sanatarium, and mentions at the very beginning that he was sexually abused. The whole thing about catching his sister in the rye is his way of wanting to keep her from experiencing similar trauma in her life, to retain the innocence of childhood.

Is he whiny and snotty and sarcastic? Absolutely. But he's got good reason to be, and we're seeing his pain.",babrooks213,2018-11-08T21:15:43Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1

Catcher in the Rye is of the latter kind for me. That Holden character is a mere excuse for Salinger to induce that feeling - not some role model whose attitude should be emulated.

Quoting The Catcher in the Rye for adolescent wannabe edgy behaviour is as valid as stating one can do whatever one wants in a democracy, cause people are free. You probably dislike the morons who do that, not Holden. Or the book.

34iwxk_1,34iwxk,"Catcher in the Rye seems to get a lot of hate on this subreddit, which I think is undeserved. Everyone says that Holden Caufield is just this whiny entitled brat who won't shut up about the ""phonies"". But what everyone seems to forget is that he is just a kid.

He's a depressed kid who watched one brother die young and another brother turn into a prostitute. His parents shipped him off to a boarding, and when he gets there he finds that all his peers arent thinking about the same things he has been forced to face at such an early age. Not to mention the kid that jumps out the window (wearing Holdens sweater!) that really pushes his views even more leaning towards ""whats the point?""

He spends the entire book with basically no motivation other than helping kids, and trying to protect children. 
The whole wanting to be the catcher in the rye catching all the kids who fall off the cliff thought that Holden keeps having is him wanting to save kids from all the shit that you can't save a kid from when they eventually grow up. 

Between his parents, his sister, the prostitute, and his teacher he goes to see, all Holden Caulfield wants is someone to comfort him and save him from wondering off that cliff into the rye fields. ",Roi_Rondoudou,2015-05-01T16:58:52Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1

He reaches a finalization that Adulthood is where it all ends, the points in time where maturity takes over and the innocence that you once held is now perished. He wants to be the catcher in the rye to prevent kids from growing up. Growing up too fast and not enjoying what they have now, in a way he is describing high school if you think about it... We as teens are too preoccupied in growing up, in becoming the adult we want to be able to drink, drive (not together xD), etc. He wants everyone to just stop and wait and take a breather.

3h5rxx_2,3h5rxx,"This is a pretty late response and I actually made an account just for this post, but I've been itching to talk to someone about The Catcher in the Rye as well. I read this book for the first time a couple of months ago at 25 and i found it absolutely profound, and I can sympathize with Holden completely. All i knew about the novel prior to reading it is that it's supposedly about the search for authenticity, so i didn't have any expectations and i wasn't looking for the common themes that most critics pin on it. I spent some time reading criticisms and praises, but there's one thing that jumped out at me: I saw a question on some sparknotes type website which went something like ""Is being a catcher in the rye a realistic goal?"", with multiple answers which all claimed that it is absolutely unrealistic and is just Holden's fantasy because you cannot save children from growing up. So basically, the common interpretation of Holder wanting to be a catcher in the rye is about him wanting to preserve children's innocence and save them from descending into adulthood phoniness... but I don't think that's what it's about at all. I don't think Holden is struggling to grow up or become an adult at all, (although that obviously depends on one's definition of adulthood). It seemed to me that more than anything he is someone that is very perceptive and is able to see people's true nature through pure intuition - this is not a childish quality at all - and one of the things that make this novel pure genius is that it brilliantly captures the confusion and devastation that comes with that kind of intuition when you aren't exactly aware of it at that particular age. So criticizing Holden as overdramatic childish and whiny is absurd. I think what he's struggling to find is a worthwhile purpose in life precisely because his understanding of the human condition is so far beyond his years. It's a kind of mid-life-crisis so to say, and most people experience it after playing house and having a 9-5 cubicle job for a couple of decades without ever really assessing what it is they're trying to accomplish in life. Holden just happened to hit it WAY earlier than most people. (And the 'whiny/childish' and repetitive qualities in his narration are the only things that make him identifiable as a teenager, otherwise he would sound like 40-year old man.) 
Which brings me back to the point that i failed to make earlier - becoming a catcher in the rye is ABSOLUTELY realistic and is in fact his redemption and new-found purpose in life - i don't think it's about saving children from adulthood, I think it's a writer's purpose in life - to provide something for the younger generations in order to bring validity and clarity to their confusion and devastation about the world. And that's exactly what i got out of this novel. Being a catcher in the rye imo is the most profound metaphor for being a good writer. Holden is the child falling off a cliff, and this book is for people like him (children or not) which provides an extremely relatable descent into desperation and a perfect solution to disillusionment with life.
As for the Mr.Antolini's gay advances theory, i think story-wise it would have been WAY too neat for Holden to just agree and have a good time and chill out right after the conversation he had with the teacher. Imo he had to stay in character, and as a stressed out sexually frustrated teenager, his disturbed reaction to the teacher's tipsy fatherly kindness was basically the perfect exit strategy to continue on with the story. I think Mr.Antolini's behaviour was pretty spot on for someone who can truly understand and feel Holden's pain, and I didn't find it creepy at all.

3h5rxx_3,3h5rxx,"It's been awhile since I read *The Catcher in the Rye*.

I didn't like it for a few reasons. I'm not going to lie; the biggest reason was probably because I had to read it for school. I can't really think of any school-assigned novels that I actually liked (maybe ATOTC, but to be fair I had read once or twice before it was assigned, IIRC).

The Catcher in the Rye also just isn't the type of book I like. I prefer conventional writing styles. I'm not really interested in reading every little thing that a character thinks. And the fucking tangents he goes off on... those were so aggravating for me to read.

And I dislike Holden because he's a whiny child. Yes, it's understandably *why* he's so whiny, but that doesn't mean I have to like his constant complaints. I will admit that a large part of the reason I dislike Holden for this *is* because of the way the story was told -- but the story wouldn't be the same if it was told a different way.

Maybe I'm due for a re-reading, but I doubt I can bring myself to do it. I just really did not like this book.

Also, is it the standard interpretation that Holden was probably sexually abused by that one teacher? I remember reading the scene where Holden is sleeping on the teacher's couch in class and someone brought up that possibility, but IIRC the teacher said that it was just like a fatherly thing to do or something.

xvz0u_1,xvz0u,"The problem with The Catcher in the Rye is that most people don't catch the symbolism or don't realize how real the story portrays a society (NY in 50s).

Holden doesn't understand why he likes his red hunting hat so much. This is because (in my opinion) it is the same color of his favorite person's, his brother, Allie's hair.

There's many more subtleties that most people don't pay attention too.

And to the people who don't like Holden as a character don't understand Holden. His entire life he tries to get people to listen to him but no one ever does. By the end of the book, you should realize that he has gotten you to listen/read his story (assuming you weren't forced to read it in English class or something). Also, he is surrounded by a bunch of pretentious assholes or complete idiots (sound familiar?).

xvz0u_2,xvz0u,"And to add on to the topic of innocence and adulthood:

Holden himself cannot distinguish whether he is innocent or mature. He drinks and smokes but he cannot bring himself to have sex (back then it would've been less common for a teen to have sex). Once he sees the prostitute who is seemingly his age he notices he doesn't want to cross that line seeing how the prostitute probably had a terrible life. All around him people seem to know where they are, Phoebe is obviously innocent, Stradlater is not, Ackley doesn't care, and DB is far past the transition state. Even though Holden tries to keep his innocence (by talking to Phoebe, the girl in the park, and listening to the boy sing the Catcher in the Rye song) he can't escape the fact he's aging. This is evident in my favorite line of the book: ""That's the whole trouble. You can't ever find a place that's nice and peaceful, because there isn't any. You may think there is, but once you get there, when you're not looking, somebody'll sneak up and write 'Fuck You' right under your nose.""",justpaul95,2012-08-09T02:13:25Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,2

Also, throughout most of the book, he's terrified of growing up as if adulthood is a definite place, but he's so comforted he almost starts crying when he sees Phoebe going around and around on the carousel, both to and from the gold ring, or innocence.

The novel lends itself to a binge read since it's not too long, the writing is straightforward, and there isn't much complexity in plot (it's literally Holden going from place to place throughout the week). *The Catcher in the Rye* does a great job at expressing the frustrating interval between childhood and adulthood, and does it in a way to make Holden seem like a real person and not *just* a mouthpiece for the author. This novel kills me, it really does. The funny thing is, I can't relate to Holden a whole lot, but it's written so well that it feels like I can sympathize rather than empathize. That's what makes it a great novel.

Books capture internal thoughts of their characters much better than film ever can, and most adaptations to me just feel like they took the source material and either diluted it, or gutted the themes and made cheap, easily digestible blockbusters (I'm looking at your World War Z).

Like, especially with something like The Catcher in the Rye.  All of it exists in Holden's head.  In film all you'd get would be an angsty teenager walking around New York and asking cab drivers about ducks.

1kbje6_1,1kbje6,"I always thought that Catcher in the Rye was about someone fearing change or fearing what they cannot control, but in the end coming to terms that change happens or that situations occur that you cannot control. 


I think that people dislike this book because they have already found a way to cope with those things and do not understand why somebody would be ""whiny"" about them. He is growing up. These people forgot how it is to grow up! 


Then there are people who haven't experiences a situation that was beyond their control or upsetting to them and can't relate. I guess you should feel privileged for that, but be weary because one day that situation will occur and you will be acting like Holden.


I feel that people that enjoy the book are those that are either currently going through a situation that is hard for them to cope with or people that STILL remember how hard it was to grow up and enjoy the book because it's a teenager learning a valuable lesson that they learned and still remember. You just can't be the catcher in the rye. Life does not work like that and that is what Holden realizes. That is what some people are realizing and what their realized and still look back at. I feel that those people are the ones that enjoy the book.


I always feared change and did not like that things had to change (just like Holden doesn't like that the ducks have to go! He wants things to stay the same...although insignificant to some, the duck thing shows he problem with change). The book, although not life changing, did allow me to see that there are things out of your control and you have to let them go. Just how Holden, after seeing his sister at the end, realized he can't change anything and can just enjoy the time he is currently having with his sister! That's what I got from the book and that is why I like it a lot.

udpki_1,udpki,"Denis Johnson's *Angels* has the gritty aspects of *Catcher in the Rye*, and a very similar depressing tone. The story itself is nothing like *Catcher*, in that it's not about how phony society is. It's only similar in atmosphere.

If you're looking for something that has similar themes, but is more geared towards adults, there's no better book than *The Recognitions*. In fact, I just went to Amazon to give you a link to the book, and this is the top review:

> The Recognitions is the extreme terminus of ""The Catcher in the Rye."" Both are concerned with exposing the phony, the counterfeit. Gaddis' work is far more mature, wide ranging and dispairing. His erudition is breathtaking. The work attacks the fake and counterfeit in society, art, Christianity, personal morality and business. My favorite bits are Gaddis' thrashing of Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"", and the weird flashes into the pagan underpinning of Christianity. Many questions are raised and left unresolved, indeed are unresolvable. The narrative is left in fragments that bleed in all directions, blurring the line between narrative and non-narrative, the conscious and the unconscious. It is a beautiful if bitter book.

Also, I just remembered, Knut Hamsun's *Hunger* is similar, in that you're following a narrator who is slowly losing their mind, fueled by the lack of empathy and love in society, and, as the title suggests, hunger.",awaywethrow1982,2012-05-31T18:06:32Z,The Catcher in the Rye,COMMENT,1

That’s all I’d do all day. I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all.

For me it all clicked there, being younger I needed the subtly of a hammer that this scene gives. It made me very aware of how bittersweet it is to grow up. How when we transition from this...Nirvana heaven of being a child and not giving a fuck and loving life, to this jaded and untrusting person in an too unperfect world. Growing up is hard. Learning about the world is horrific. We must learn to find our inner children again.

413qhd_1,413qhd,"I think The Catcher in the Rye is a fantastic book and I would argue that Holden is one of the best realised character's in fiction. I first read the book when I was 17 and have read it several times since. I think there are two things to keep in mind when examining Holden's personality. One, Holden is a teenager. This may seem obvious but it seems to be ignored by people who dislike him. Anyone with half a brain knows that teenage years suck. Your body is changing, you're on the edge of adulthood and you're coming to the realisation that you will soon have to leave your childhood behind. This is difficult enough without mentioning school, work, and managing your family and friends. In my experience, teenage years are a time of great uncertainty and most teens don't have the experience or maturity to deal with it. 

The second thing to keep in mind when it comes to Holden is that he is pretty fucking traumatized. Not only is he having to deal with being a teenager and the fact he is flunking school and doesn't like the look of the world of adults he is about to enter, he is also dealing with some serious psychological issues. Holden lost his younger brother Allie, one of the few people he genuinely felt a connection to. Not only does he feel a great pain over the loss of his brother but he also punishes himself for the times he was mean to him (like when he said Allie couldn't come out with him and his friends). Holden reveals he smashed up his parent's garage when Allie died and badly hurt his hands smashing them through glass. Holden's relationship with his parents is also distant. They aren't bad people but it's clear that they're quite distant from their children, especially since Allie died. He can't exactly talk to them about what he's going through. Holden also mentions his mother has been full of nerves since she lost her youngest son, yet another thing for Holden to be concerned about. Holden also seems to have a good relation with his brother, D.B. but he has since moved to Hollywood and away from Holden. This really only leaves Holden's kid sister phoebe but she's a lot younger than him and isn't emotionally mature enough to understand what he's going through. Holden also seems affected by the suicide of his classmate, James Castle, who jumped out his bedroom window after being bullied. The boy was wearing Holden's turtleneck sweater when he died and from what Holden says, the boy was only covered up when Mr Antolini placed his jacket over him. That's pretty messed up. Holden has a lot of shit stuck in his head but he has no one to talk to about it and lives in a time that didn't focus as much attention on mental health. He doesn't have the internet and he has almost no way to meet like-minded people. People going through difficulties like this aren't much fun to be around and I think Holden is actually doing pretty well considering the baggage holden (couldn't resist) him down. People who say Holden is just a whiny character are kind of missing the point in two ways. Firstly, he's a teenager, teenagers are whiny. Secondly, he has also got a lot of emotional baggage. 

There's a great video review by the [Blog Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSR8J6LUaT8) which I feel sums up Holden's character pretty well. ""In response to the criticism that Holden Caulfield, the narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is unlikable, I regret to inform you that you are also unlikable, so am I. There's this weird but pervasive feeling in the world of contemporary coming of age fiction that characters ought to be either the person you want to be or the person you want to be with, but I am happy to confirm that Holden Caulfield is neither the guy you wanna be or the guy you wanna be with. He's not Edward Cullen."" 

It's also worth remembering that there are essentially two Holden's in the novel. Holden who went through the events, and Holden who is telling those events. The older Holden is aware of how he comes across in the novel and often describes himself as a maniac, as immature, and dumb. He is self aware of how different he is a year or so later.

The point of *The Catcher in the Rye* isn't to identify with Holden, it's to understand why he acts the way he does.

This complex leads him to have hypocritical beliefs on ""phoniness"" and bizarre reactions to sex and relationships.

For most of Prachett it helps to know a bit of British history, culture, and politics. Good Omens plays with Christianity, the Church, and a certain kind of middle class idealism.

If you read Discworld it will be fantasy tropes, politics, culture, and some English lit.

In particular, he likes to insert whole paragraphs worth of asides to make a point about general society that's related to the main plot being talked about. So you have to be ready for a lot of non sequiturs and convoluted sentence structure, which is definitely tough as a non-native speakers.

I will say that the humor from Good Omens is particularly tough for me even though I love the book, because so much of the satire requires you to know some specific things about 80s British culture and I'm neither British enough nor old enough to know those references. If you want to try similar satirical writing that might be less based in a culture you don't know, the Discworld books might be a good place to start.

18l9j5p_6,18l9j5p,"As other people have mentioned, Good Omens and Hitchhikers Guide are deeply rooted in Satire, which is one of the most sophisticated uses of any language. Not only must you be fluent, you must also have a deep knowledge base of things that are culturally important, and equally, taken for granted by the culture of the writers.

If you want sci-fi that might be more approachable, I recommend the Expanse books, the TV series can help clarify what might be confusing. Also Ursula K Le Guin’s Left Hand of Darkness and Dispossessed utilize clear language to describe what is happening. 

If you want a good and interesting time travel book, Doomsday Book by Connie Willis is a good read. A lot of “Britishism” but more approachable than Pratchett for folks who have had less exposure to Brit Cultural Norms.

Frank Herbert’s Dune is a fantastic slow burn that has a glossary in the back. A wonderful critique on Feudalism with an exiting sci-fi setting. 

I don’t recommend Neil Gaiman to newer English readers  because he’s not interested in plot as a writer, he’s stated multiple times he’s more into mood and setting. This can leave folks without all of the implied context on hand feeling like the work is overly thin and nonsensical.

I would suggest, perhaps, trying to read some of his young adult stuff. The Graveyard Book, for example, is aimed more at children, but it's still a fantastic story with some excellent ideas. It's an exciting fantasy, and has a lot of the same kind of supernatural mystery and weirdness as his more adult books do, but the writing is a lot more understandable.

Pratchett (and sometimes Gaiman) writes with a very colloquial style so you can’t just flatly read the words on the page but you need to sort of imagine their “delivery” in order to get the most meaning out of them.

Remember the kids in school who would read out loud very monotonously? The. Fork. Ran. Away. With. The. Spoon. Each word was siloed and its meaning/interpretation stands alone. But that’s not really how words work in conversations. Now imagine how David Tennant would say the same thing: The fork *ran away* with the **spoon**.

18l9j5p_10,18l9j5p,"I really think it’s because English isn’t your first language, especially if you would call your proficiency level “beginner reader.” Both Good Omens and Hitchhiker’s Guide have this quirky and extremely British style of language. What’s fun and interesting about the book is not just the story and characters but in the way they play around with the language, and that kind of play is very hard for someone who isn’t fully fluent in a language to access and appreciate. My family on my dad’s side is from the Netherlands, and I know just a little bit of Dutch, and those of my paternal family who are most proficient in English have all agreed that puns and jokes that rely on playing-on-words were the *very last* thing to click into place when they became fluent in English. It’s high-level stuff!

I think it’s really impressive to have any kind of proficiency in more than one language (I hope to get there with Dutch one day, for family reasons, and Spanish also, for its usefulness in the U.S.!). And there’s no shame at all to me in finding it difficult, especially when you’re going for a book that’s more complex in the language - either because it’s a not-totally-modern form of English (eg Jane Austen’s work, she lived and wrote in the Regency period) or because it’s a particular voice/style from a particular region (Good Omens, Hitchhiker’s Guide). I hope this experience doesn’t discourage you - maybe keep these books to try again later?

18l9j5p_12,18l9j5p,"You are missing the second dash there that separates out a chunk of this sentence. The punctuation is very important because it's what makes this sentence readable for a native speaker.

*First piece of information set off by a comma:* [Sometimes this sort of leaflet had a little historical bit],

*Second piece of information:* because the kind of companies that hired places like this for a weekend [. . .] liked to feel that they were strategically interacting in the very building [. . .] that some Elizabethan financier had endowed as a plague hospital.

*Humorous detail:* of Interactive Personnel Analysis or A Conference on the Strategic Marketing Dynamic

*Humorous detail:* —give or take a couple of complete rebuildings, a civil war, and two major fires—

This sentence is not really meant to be easily readable on the first go; native speakers may have to break it down mentally like above. Many will not understand the full thought just reading it once. They would be more likely to have it ""click"" right away hearing it read out loud, but in a book they may have to read it through twice to understand what the pacing and tone of each part is supposed to be. This is not a flaw in this type of satirical writing style, but a feature. The need to reread it and the feeling you get when it clicks for you is often what makes the joke really funny. Hitchhiker's Guide and Good Omens are also full of much simpler sentences that are likewise intended for rereading because what they say is simply so unexpected.

This type of book is not meant to be fluid; reading it is more like being told a story by a comedian, keeping in mind that someone telling a story verbally will use tone, pacing, and pauses to help but a book cannot do this. It's okay for it not to flow and it's okay to have to think hard about it, because it's overly complicated and a bit rambling on purpose. There are not a lot of authors who write in this specific way and it's very advanced for a non-native speaker, and that's okay because they're not always easy books for native speakers either. The audiobooks may be significantly easier for you to follow.

Hitchhiker's Guide and Good Omens are my two favourite books and have been since childhood. My dad gave me Hitchhiker's Guide to read when I was nine because I'd grown up loving watching Monty Python's Flying Circus and other British comedies with him (although we are not British). I was a highly advanced and voracious reader and had been primed with lots of media with a similar sense of humour, but Hitchhiker's Guide *blew my mind*. It was completely different in tone and language than anything I'd ever read before, and it had a far more profound impact on my sense of humour and writing style than anything else I've ever read. It is *very, very different* from almost anything else you will ever come across, and honestly many native speakers have never read anything like it in their lives. So do not worry about it being difficult.",alloutofbees,2023-12-18T20:26:33Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,12
18l9j5p_13,18l9j5p,"It's strange, because I love Good Omens/HHGTTG/Discworld novels for exactly the same reasons that the OP hates them.

Personally, I felt that Gaiman & Pratchett were intentionally channelling Adams's style of writing when they wrote Good Omens, and Adams was heavily into satirizing British culture. This is exactly what Gaiman & Pratchett did in Good Omens. 

The humour in these books is very distinct. It is very Pythonesque. I think, when I first watched Monty Python, I didn't 'get it' either. I was either too young, or hadn't developed a sense of the absurd. - The Ministry of Silly Walks? The Dead Parrot? Spam? The Larch? - What was all of this nonsense?? It was a bunch of short surreal sketches that sometimes didn't have a punchline, and didn't make much sense. 

As I grew a bit older, and more aware that the world was an absurd place, I realised what Monty Python was trying to do, and revisiting those episodes with a different perspective. I had that epiphany. 

Exactly the same thing with HHGTTG - The book was funny in parts when I first read it when I was about 11 or 12, but I was confused by some of it. I didn't have an awareness of Schrodinger or Einstein's scientific principles, for example. Reading lines like ""The ships hung in the sky the way that brick's don't"", on the other hand, didn't need any of that. It was just a funny joke.

With Good Omens, though, I recognised the style of humour straight away, and had the awareness of what the authors were poking fun at. From the Edward Bulwer-Lytton alternative, through the paradoxical nature of the Bible, the cheesy Omen movies, Enid Blyton books, religious ideologies through the centuries, the Inferno, witchcraft, British sensibilities and the ideas that Good and Evil are not set in stone, I did not have the same struggles, and for me, it was a treasure trove of jokes and sharp observations.",trelloskilos,2023-12-19T07:50:31Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,13

And they are \*very\* easy to read by people that are learning English and are starting to read in English to improve the language. I was in the same position as you. I started with ""simplified editions"" - books in English that are re-written to use simple vocabulary and grammar. There are many levels of difficulty. After I finished all the simplified editions for English learners our library had, I took home a bunch of books and had to return them unread. In desperation I saw a Dick Francis book and borrowed it. I have read most of his books in translation and I knew he writes page-turners. I breezed through the book, once I sorted out the horse-racing vocabulary. But that is only a small hurdle.

2. Both books are very conversational, so every sentence, not just dialog, are written how people speak, with a lot of asides, conversational short cuts  off set by conversational ramblings.

3. Both books have a ""back story"" that they just jump back and forth between story events and ""historical or technological explanations"" of why things are the way they are. Good Omens actually has 2 ""back stories"" they jump around in - The angel/demon historical activity & the Angness Nutter prophecies. It can be very confusing.

Both are setup in a universe w/ a bunch of different rules, so their are extra words and concepts that get explained in English, but don't have any actual real world reference and therfore the explanations may not make sense if you are translating them in your head to something you are farmilar with.

There are MANY classics and fan favorites that I literally cannot enjoy. 

I always recommend Agatha Christie if you’re looking for a classic that is part of the culture but also “easy,” meaning that you can just jump in and enjoy a good high quality story! If you were not bored by Jane Austen, you may prefer historical fiction over science fiction or fantasy. 

Good Omens also has a lot of British humor, and as an American who understands most of it when I see it, I don’t truly get it. Discworld and Hitchhiker’s Guide are other series I just didn’t get or enjoy.",Complex-Coffee-2195,2023-12-18T23:06:38Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,31

From reading your post, it's clear that you have an excellent understanding of the language on its own. Honestly, I would have thought it was written by a native speaker. 

However, humor is something that is difficult in translation (or when being read by someone whose first language is something different). Wordplay might not be as obvious to you, and there could be cultural references that you simply wouldn't have the context for. Given that the examples you give (Good Omens and Hitchhikers) both prioritize humor over plot, it's not too surprising that they come across as gibberish to you.

Don't be disparaged by this. Your English is still very good, from what I've read here. I would just maybe try to avoid books that focus so strongly on humor.",Itkovian_books,2023-12-18T16:48:38Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,36

18l9j5p_47,18l9j5p,"The author you quote exactly uses a very ""information starved,"" rather overly-elaborate style of writing, in your example virtually all of what is written is just filler the only important part is the first few words and even they probably don't matter very much to advancing the plot. It's kinda like someone is just randomly stripping naked and dancing the Macarena out of nowhere and it has nothing to do with the story it's just random strings of meaningless words added to pad the content out a little and try to sell more books, it's not unique to British writing but they do use it a lot.  I do not like this style of writing myself, just not enjoyable to me at all normally. Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker's guide) is another one who ""goes off"" on soliloquies or gets sidetracked all the time but his work I greatly enjoy. If I may suggest such, you being a beginner reader and not having English as your first language, but why are you reading such ""weighty"" tomes as Jane Austen? I've read maybe 25k books in my time, mostly fantasy and fictional stuff, I read cuz it's my ""TV"" it's just fluff and fun to me unless I'm actively studying something useful/practical like programming or bricklaying. But I've never bothered to (and never will) read more than a few pages of stuff like Jane Austen that's like reading ""War and Peace"", no real North Americans except in academia and the VERY rare, arrogant, usually rich, jerks do so. So why are you, a beginner reader without any English as a first language skills, reading such pointless, pretentious garbage as Jane Austen? 

I'm persistent with the question because your intent or what you want to get out of the experience matters here, if you're looking to understand Western Culture better or because you desire to fit in more you'd be way better off watching The Simpsons, and i VERY STRONGLY URGE YOU to watch the Hitchhiker's Guide MOVIE, ideally with subtitles in your native language turned on, both Good Omens and the book Hitchhiker's guide and maybe a lot of North American culture might make a lot more sense afterwards.",JesterDoobie,2023-12-18T18:52:19Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,47

Overall, you are miles ahead of me and many others in that you HAVE a second language you can speak/read.

They're both good enough authors to  either give all necessary context in the book itself, or they reference such universal human themes that anyone can relate to them. For example someone in the comments said that Good Omens references the Just William series, which I have never heard of until today, but a kid with a gang, a dog, and nature to explore and play around in is such a universal trope, that I got the gist of the setting quickly enough. 

 In fact this is why I love the Discworld as well. Pratchett's writing has such a human and relatable quality to it, it's insane.

Terry Pratchett is rather the same I think.  They're not afraid to take a detour from the main story for a good laugh or a little background.

How are you feeling about the characters?",rex_wexler,2020-11-11T17:24:20Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,7
jsc81f_8,jsc81f,"So here's something to consider. Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.

Terry Pratchett's development as an author is one who mastered people, at least fictional people. His characters feel real in the way they act and respond to their environment.

Neil Gaiman is a man that is obsessed with story, in a meta sense. He loves stories about stories, stories about how we make stories and how these stories outlive their origins and grow to become something more (see American Gods, ""Dream"" comic book series etc.)

In Good Omens, these two things come together really, REALLY fucking well.

The mythology aspects of the apocalypse are really well done by Gaiman, who probably worked on the settings and plot.

The characters of Crowley, Aziraphale and Adam are probably in large part, products of Pratchett. Crowley and Aziraphale are stranded adversaries, who find that, to be really honest, the people above them have no idea about their day to day. Ever had a boss who didn't understand your job and was only interested in the outcomes. The Angels and Devils and all the metaphysical forces see the world as their chessboard, but its real to Crowley and Aziraphale. They love it and will defend it. When it's threatened, the act accordingly, like real people would. They try to do their best to minimise the threat of the antichrist while risking as little exposure as possible to themselves. When the story starts, they're cowards. The stakes have to rise more and more to get them to act in a non-conservative manner. This escalates throughout the book. Adam is the best character in the book. He is a child. A precocious one, but one nonetheless. Outside, of any angelic or infernal influence, he becomes the epitome of the very centre between the two. Absolutely Human, with a capital H.

The culmination of the book is that very fact.

The journey there is what the book wants to show you about yourself. It's kind of a love letter to the human race, at least that's how I see it.   

That, and its execution makes it a classic for me.

Maybe you have to be more familiar with Discworld and Gaimans work to have a greater appreciation it.",the_stickiest_one,2020-11-11T20:42:06Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,8

Pratchett's signature is the juxtaposition of the mundane and the fantastic, be it for humourous or for dramatic effect (he pulls off either at different time). Gaiman's signature is that he creates fascinating tableaus that you enjoy exploring in great detail, even if not all that much happens (a little bit like Wes Anderson movies).  

Combining the two runs the risk of creating a tableau of the mundane, which is why some readers find Good Omens quite ponderous. If you find Crowley and Aziraphale to be incredibly interesting and cool then you will revel in all the time spent digging into their back-story and relationship, while the plot kind of meanders along in the background as an afterthought. If you don't much like Crowley and Aziraphale then the whole thing will come across as a bit of a self-indulgent mess.",Dr_Neil_Stacey,2020-11-11T21:32:24Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,11

If you haven't seen the Amazon series, you should watch it.

If you enjoyed The Graveyard Book, consider reading Neverwhere next. They have similar styles, and Neverwhere is really well written. Gaiman’s books of short stories are also excellent, and give a better idea of the breadth of his style.",kittensandrobots,2020-11-11T20:18:19Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,52
jsc81f_53,jsc81f,"I love Terry Pratchett immensely and like Neil Gaiman... sometimes (Ocean at the End of the Lane is fantastic, but I barely made it through American Gods). 

I truly feel like Good Omens was sort of the worst of both of them. It doesn't have the dark sort of fairy-tale brooding of Gaiman's stuff that I like and the Pratchett influence just sort of feels like a muted version of his usual writing if any of that makes sense. Like you can definitely see the influences of both authors, but reading it to me just felt like something that ended up being somehow less than the sum of its parts.

I fully understand this is heresy to a lot of people, but I've also met a lot of people who have read Good Omens and loved it, but never read much of either authors' other works other than, maybe, American Gods. That both baffles and saddens me immensely, but I can see how someone could think it's fucking amazing and hilarious and so astute and witty if they haven't read ""Going Postal"" or the ""Ankh-Morpork City Watch"" books or ""Small Gods.""

AG is by far the superior work. Omens is silly, so its the outlier of the 3 I read, but then again his Doctor Who episode, the Doctor's Wife is one of my favorites, and that is a little silly as well.

I have Sandman, Graveyard and Coraline on my wish list, so I'm a Gaiman fan. He just dips into a lot of genres, so I'd recommend checking out a synopsis so you know what you are getting into; it helps put me in the right headspace.

I reread Good Omens and loved it.  I think I just had to get accustomed to Pratchett's very distinctive voice and style. Gaiman alone, I think, is a much more straightforward storyteller.

You may still like Gaiman's other work. Gaiman, IMO, tends to border on macabre or ennui. The silliness of Good Omens doesn't meet that trend and it's not *particularly* representative of his full library. Give another book a shot!",Runningwithbeards,2020-11-11T21:58:51Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,71

As a fiction writer he hadn’t found his style yet and I think that shows by the book as a whole feeling very much to be Pratchett’s voice. 

Secondly, the story structure is that of a parallel narrative, with many equally weighted storylines, each with their own protagonists. In Good Omens these protagonists move inexorably towards the final climax when they all come together at a single place and time. Parallel narratives can often feel messy and be a bit challenging to follow. I’ve found it can help to focus on how the characters are being moved to that final meeting, the journey often revealing their importance, rather than trying to suss out who they are as soon as they appear.",endophage,2020-11-12T02:22:42Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,103

I think Pratchett's plot writing is a lot easier to see *in retrospect* than in the moment. He loves to write endings that call back to all the small interactions you thought were just window dressing, but fit perfectly with the themes of the main conflict. Granny Weatherwax is the epitome of this - it's really hard to understand her ""clever practical solutions *are* magic"" point of view, until you get to the climax of the story, and you see that all of her small errands lead to a perfect logical solution to the problem. Going Postal is another great example of this kind of plot-by-worldbuilding, and it has one of my favorite endings in all of fantasy, besides the Bartimaeus trilogy and LotR.",Greaserpirate,2020-11-12T03:25:47Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,112

I'd consider picking up Neverwhere, and see if that works better for you. Fail that, check out  China Mieville, specifically Un Lun Dun, and Perdido Street Station, if you really want your brain to work. (I think The Scar is first, then Perdido Street Station, then Iron Council, but it's been awhile.) Similar stylings, but Mieville is wicked clever, and it's beautifully written.

jsc81f_120,jsc81f,"Good Omens is a collaboration work between Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. 

It feels so much more like a Terry Pratchett book to me. The personification of famine, war, pestilence/pollution, and death are nearly straight out of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. 

I think Neil Gaimen may be responsible for some of the character work. But its so much more a Pratchett book to me. 

It also IS more scattered than Pratchett AND Gaimens other work. Its a flaw. Basically tbe scattered nature comes from not understanding that a scene has changed and thst these seemingly unrelated scenes are connected. It always seemed to me that it was written as if it was a screenplay not a novel. Hence tbe heavy reliance on numerous scenes and transitions. 

Even with its flaws It is a great book. I've read it twice. Its a parody of tbe 1980 and 1990 Omen demon antichrist child horror movies of that Era. 

Pratchett is a satirist. Every character he ever made was satirical. Pratchett is a philosopher as well with a positive eworld outlook. 

Gaimen is more bleak with a fascination with the macabre and death.

jsc81f_140,jsc81f,"I have an old (mid 1990's) interview with Neil Gaiman where he points out that Good Omens was written by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett trying to make each other laugh. Most of the aspects you mention follow from that: the off-the-wall humor, the footnotes, the copying each others' styles, the 'hey, look, another cool thing' tempo of the book.

And after 300-odd pages of faffing about, they sent the whole thing to a publisher, it somehow got greenlit and became a cult hit, and here we are. Gaiman himself mentions in that interview that they had no interest in doing a sequel because of the weight of expectations. I believe he quipped in typical Gaiman-esque fashion that 'men with very serious briefcases and very thin watches have to have several meetings before Terry and I are allowed in the same room'.

So Good Omens is what it is: two talented, off-beat writers jamming on a typewriter. It resonated because there wasn't anything like it at the time, it helped launch two lauded careers (and this helped the book stay in the spotlights), and it's eminently quotable. But there's not any *more* to it than that: there's no hidden code, no perspective-switching realisation, no volumes of literary analysis.

It's kind of interesting, and I could be wrong, but it sounds like Pratchett actually reached out to him instead of the other way around, and it really doesn't sound like they gave themselves a ton of time on the project. 

Good Omens is one of my favorite books and Pratchett and Gaiman are two of my favorite writers, but Good Omens does feel like a Pratchett novel based on a Gaiman premise with some Gaiman writing splashed in. Which makes sense, Pratchett was a much more established writer at the time it was written while Gaiman had less published works.  

However, the Good Omens show was not worked on by Pratchett but is filled with good humor that I don't specifically remember from the book. I think Gaiman is funny, just not in a telling jokes kind of way.",trisarahdots,2020-11-11T20:53:51Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,170

So Gaiman to me is a little bit of the “heres an edgy teen 80’s goth” take on a thing and i never really fully got into his characters (besides Death, who had a very good solo comic story). Whereas Pratchett i feel does very well and good with his characters, they’re all very different but very relatable in a ways, and his humor and observation feel more natural and organic with his writing style. That being said, there’s an adaptation of The Sandman on audible that came out recently and im enjoying it even though the first part of the series in the comics at least is a little weak compared to the rest of the series",geenersaurus,2020-11-12T10:30:17Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,181

Discworld keeps Pratchett's themes, and Gaiman carries those themes in his writing. For Gaiman, if you like Adam's story line or the Witch and that fella, read The Ocean at the End of the Lane. If you like the 4 horsemen, read Mort (Pratchett) or American Gods (Gaiman).

I've always thought that Good Omens stands on its own so well because it was Pratchett's ability to ridiculously reinterpret of a lot of scenes that would have otherwise been pretty standard reined in by Gaiman's stronger control of the narrative.  The first two books in the Discworld series suffered from a weak narrative and you can watch his writing style mature as the Discworld books progress.",jux589,2020-07-05T11:38:26Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,20

Good Omens though, the soul of it hinges very much on the tone of the narration, you can't just leave it out, and an actuall narrator (like with A Series of Unfortunate Events) would probably be a bit cringey (YMMV).

Funny enough, American Gods is my standout favorite book (ha!

Huuuh, not really?

Good Omens Death starts a lot like late-Discworld Death (especially that Elvis joke in the bar), but later in the book becomes a lot more like the Death from earlier in Discworld, and even more like the ""Fake Death"" from Reaper Man.

It lacks the whole curiosity about the human mind, and the feel of responsibility.",Lamedonyx,2017-08-16T06:14:03Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,28

The studio took over most of creative control from Gaiman and tried to drag it out. The first season is pretty good, and it just starts going downhill from there. And as much as I utterly adore Pablo Schrieber, as a Canadian he's just an odd ""Hollywood"" type choice for Mad Sweeny. Were *all* the actual Irish actors busy? He does it very well (because he's Pablo Schrieber) but the show is a waste of his talent IMO.

Admittedly I've only gotten through about half of the Discworld series (I think there is nearly 40 of them), and haven't read any of Pratchett's other series. Still, in the niche realm of fantasy satire, I feel he's at the top of the game. Most of the Discworld miniseries are worth watching as well.

I read The Sandman in it's entirety around 2005 and was absolutely blown away by. It really got me back into comics. Covering the rest of Gaiman's work actually led me to Pratchett by way of Good Omens. Probably my favorite of his works, besides The Sandman, is Anansi Boys. I really liked American Gods, and Anansi was my favorite character from it so the follow up title really resonated with me, actually hit close to home.

I couldn't watch American Gods. It made me sad. Really looking forward to the Netflix adaptation of Sandman though, as well as the upcoming Sandman/Locke & Key crossover book.

I would recommend The Bromeliad Trilogy if you want to stick with Pratchett. They're actually kids books, but they're great fun to read and don't really feel like kids books. I reread all three often, once every year and a half or so, and I enjoy them just as much each time as I did the first.

As for how to get into reading, I would start by looking at the TV shows and movies you like and try to figure out why you like them. For example, if you like the Marvel movies, maybe you enjoy adventure stories with a hero's journey and a redemption arc, witty dialogue, and a low level of fantasy or futurism. Or, if you enjoy The Devil Wears Prada, it might be for the subtle social commentary, sharp dialogue, and luxurious atmosphere.

Ok, so, after you make a list of two or three specific movies or shows and the elements you like in them, take that list to your local library. Go to the information desk or checkout desk, tell them you're wanting to start reading more. Give them your list. They will help you find a book or two, and will probably give you a list of others to try when you're done with those.

I've noticed Pratchett seems to have this third quarter of the book pattern where the humor dies down a bit but he's setting up an absolutely wild finish so if you're like me you might have to really push to get through that third quarter, or risk putting it down for a while. Also ""Small Gods"" was good.

If you want a satire kind of humor I really liked Catch-22. Now, it's about war so parts of it are really, really rough. Couple of passages I had to just kinda sit there and recover after reading. But, very good.

I just finished reading Good Omens
It is too scattered. It does come to a point later but it probably just isn't the kind of book I would like.
 The whole book is too 'wordy'. I see where the authors are trying to be funny but it's just like reading words and words, not an actual story. 

I like the characters of Aziraphale, Crowley, Pepper, Adam etc. But it's just so weird and pointless. The whole book was like a wild goose chase, literally. All these characters looking for Adam. 

Most of the characters were just standing on the stage crowding it with absolutely no contribution at all. The whole 'witchfinder' thing. The annoying character of the sergeant, that Madame Truffey. 
What were they even doing? Pulsifier and even Anathema Device. They had a role just for the sake of it. Oh and even the four 'horsemen' not to talk about the completely unnecessary bar scene  and the 'other four horsemen'.

The adaptations of the works of Terry Pratchett have been surprisingly inoffensive. Not like incredible, groundbreaking artistry, but very solid and entertaining. Captured surprising amounts of that Pratchett-magic. I have hope that Good Omens won't suck, but it could honestly go any which way at this point. 

I think the most likely scenario is that it will be ""pretty alright"", with fans of the book being divided between the group that could never be satisfied and the group that is so blinded by love that they don't care about whether the actual show is good.

Just a comment re Discworld. It is the setting for 41 books that can be subdivided as focused on different characters and with different themes. If you aren't sure you want to read them all, I would start with a character you find interesting. The main candidates are Rincewind the student wizard, Tiffany Aching the young witch, Mort death's apprentice, Granny Weather wax Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlik the three witches, Captain Vimes of the city watch and Moist von Lipwig The con artist. 

Discworld also has stand alone books like Small Gods and Pyramids. Pratchett also wrote Nation and the Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents and a few other books outside of Discworld",boxer_dogs_dance,2023-08-21T04:17:26Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,1
15wurlg_2,15wurlg,"Good omens is one of my favorite books.

The TV series did an amazing job of bringing it to the screen.

The authors complemented each other very well.

I think it's important to stress how much the story is a humanist tale. A repeating theme is the simarity between angels and demons and ,for the most part, their indifference to humanity.

Of course with the exception of 2 of the main characters who have become more human and grown closer to each other  after thousands of years on earth.

If you read pratchetts discworld stories you'll see similar themes with The Auditors representing the forces of a cold and indifferent universe keen to grind humanity into dust while the 4 (5) horsemen have grown closer to humanity.

In good omens most of the machinations of heaven, hell and even the main characters turn out to be almost irrelevant. They're just spinning their wheels for the most part.

the resolution of the story actually flows almost entirely from how Adam is treated by his parents, neighbours and friends.",WTFwhatthehell,2023-08-21T07:58:10Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,2

>The thing they say we should remember is that “*in those days Neil Gaiman was barely Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett was only just Terry Pratchett*”

Discworld is wonderful, I think a lot of people may discount it because it appears at first glance a bit ""dungeons and dragons"" but the writing style and the characters are FAR more modern and incredibly well crafted, more like characters from Sci-Fi than Lord of The Rings, and with a fantastic sense of humour (think Douglas Adams) in the narration, world-building and overall writing.

I'd really recommend everyone suspend their scepticism about fantasy for at least one Terry Pratchett book just to give it a try - Night Watch is one that comes very highly recommended, as do the entire *Watch* series.

It's *almost* a shame that most of the Discworld stuff is so fantastic that it's almost impossible to adapt to the screen. Good Omens managed the job incredibly well but that world is very similar to our own.",JCDU,2023-08-21T13:00:43Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,5

edit: meandering ramble beyond this point.

The first book series I loved was Hitchhikers & I remember going to a bookstore afterwards, asking for a recommendation & getting Good Omens... not a bad start at all.

Sometime in grade school we had to write a book report on a book of our choosing. I have a vivid memory of being pulled aside by the teacher & absolutely failing to explain HHGG... *is it an astronomy book?* I can only imagine what it sounded like from the mouth of a preteen who had never heard Slartibartfast pronounced out loud.

Good Omens would have made for a more accessible book report.

Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (2016) was another good adaptation. I thought the first season was special & the Men of the Machine was a rich enough idea to justify a spinoff

>\[...\] At some point the cult figured out how to use the machine to swap souls and bodies. At first they used it to swap into animal bodies as a spiritual experience>!, but soon realized they could use it for material gains too. They began to swap into wealthy people to aquire funds, often retirees that wouldn't be missed after the cult discarded them. Then they became more bold, swapping into powerful and famous people long-term to acquire their identities and resources, infiltrating society and prolonging their own lives.!<",mule_roany_mare,2023-08-21T19:33:34Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,6

Either way, I agree on their looks for those roles, and your reasoning! Benedict playing angry as Sherlock was quite terrifying, looked very inhuman at points in A Study In Pink even, so him as Crowley would be fantastic.

The thing of which I spoke:

Okay, so Benedict was/is in Frankenstein onstage. Well, in the US at least, they are showing, in select theaters, two recordings of this show on two different nights. One of the nights, Benedict plays Dr. Frankenstein, and someone else plays the monster. The OTHER night, Benedict plays the monster, and the actor who previously played the monster now plays Dr. Frankenstein.

I've also had an academic/outsider interest in Christianity without being a follower of any religion.

Part of why it feels weird to read is that you've two very different senses of very odd and slightly whacky humor, and there could be some overall cross-Pond culture shock.

My friend, an American with American parents and family, got a different read than I did (dual citizenship, with more than half my family in the UK). Our different lives gave us different takes, which was kinda neat and you don't see that super often.

The big ideas remind me a lot of a more comedic version of Gaiman's other work but the humor and style seem very Pratchett to me.",stereobreadsticks,2021-12-09T00:20:48Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,2

It doesn't really read like either individual author's other works, to me, especially in humor delivery.

Colour of Magic - the first discworld might not be the best place to start if you didn't like Good Omens as it is feel similarly disconnected somehow.  Once his recurring characters find their feet though the Discworld series is unfailingly superb. HIs empathetic understanding of human nature and the ability to recreate that it in all manner of fantasy species holding a mirror up to Earth is incredibly engaging. 

Night watch is possibly my favourite book of all time.

I enjoy that the vibe is very much deadpan/matter of fact/straight faced, allowing the absurdity of the content to shine.

I want to add that, while Gaiman doesn’t typically go on for nested exposition like how we see in Good Omens, he does tend to juggle topics or narratives in his writing. One of the most recognizable examples of this would be in American Gods, where throughout the book there are little “Coming to America” segments, where things are happening that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but they do serve to immerse the reader in the setting. 
Another example would be in Neverwhere, where the narrative often breaks away to give the reader insight on what Croup and Vandemar are up to, or some little scheme the Marquis de Carabas is working on behind the scenes. 
Sandman is probably, however, the most prolific example, where you sometimes get lengthy stretches where the narrative switches completely to another character (The Corinthian, for example) or where a whole short story unfolds where Dream only appears as a peripheral character or doesn’t appear at all and it’s only after the short story the narrative goes back to whatever Dream is doing (example: the famous Midsummer Night’s Dream bit). These seem like distractions but they always become relevant later on. 

Just wanted to point that out because a lot of people in this thread are casually saying that it’s not typical of Gaiman‘a writing style and that’s partly true, but if OP finds the exposition in Good Omens taxing to read, then they might also find the layered narrative of some (not all) of Gaiman’s works to be equally unpleasant.",AfraidOfTechnology,2021-09-17T00:19:31Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,16

Terry Pratchett books are great for re-reading because he gives you part A and part C, but you have to work out part B yourself.  I find new things each time I re-read them.

c6vxa3_2,c6vxa3,"It's hard for Doctor Who fans to realize that it's not for everyone. My advice would be to start with the Christopher Eccleston season (even though I'm not a fan of his Doctor) because it really makes the transition to Tennant that much sweeter and you see the enormous growth between him and Rose. The first bit of Matt Smith's run is good, but it gets cute pretty quick and I'll admit I lost interest. Peter Capaldi brought it back with a gruff and surly portrayal and I'll also admit that I need to catch up and watch all of his episodes because I really did get derailed by the second Matt Smith season and so on. I've watched a bit of Jodie Whittaker's show and I really do like it. It's a big change that the show needed and I'd like to get back on track. That all being said, I think the Tennant seasons just have a really special place in the hearts of any modern Doctor Who fan. It's not the rage it once was (well, not outside of England at least) but there were moments during that first season with Tennant that were some of the best in television history. It's a shame that Russell T. Davies had to leave.

Tennant has a magic about him that is intoxicating. You just can't help but feel like you'd jump off a building if he got excited about it and made it seem compelling. I'm the worst person to ask for advice for as far as Good Omens goes because I've really only seen a bit of it as a result of the fiasco with it. I do enjoy Neil Gaiman and what I've seen of the show has been pretty good, but perhaps not everything with mass appeal is going to scratch the itch for everyone. My advice would be to go to the original source as sometimes that can inspire a drive to get to know something better.

Good Omens is a good read, without a doubt. The characters are all intriguing and fun. It's a bit silly but that's what makes it so likable. 

I couldn't stand the Gold Compass, the protagonist annoyed me and the plot wasn't enough to keep me turning the pages. I'd still give it a shot though, maybe you'll find it more interesting.

9erzc5_1,9erzc5,"Good Omens always feels like it's much more a Terry Pratchett book,  than it is a Neil Gaiman book, in my opinion. The humour is more like Pratchett's, and the subject matter, as well as the inversion of the Antichrist story. This book has a little of Gaiman's darker edged cynicism, but it's mostly Pratchett.

I always really loved that Adam has the power of the Antichrist, but because he's been brought up as a normal boy, with a healthy group of family and friends, he instead chooses to live that quiet, idyllic life that we see in Tom Sawyer, or in the work of Enid Blyton and the Just William stories. He fashions the world into what he wants it to be.

Aziraphale and Crowley are a great double act, and I agree that the idea of this angel and this demon being friends, because they're just two working stiffs, and banding together to foil Crowley's boss, is a really great take on the angel/demon archetypes. Michael Sheen and David Tennant are going to have so much fun with this dynamic in the TV adaptation.

You should definitely try the Discworld books, because a lot of the themes in Good Omens are developed more there. I'd recommend starting with *Guards! Guards!*, particularly if you sympathise with blue-collar workers, fighting against bureaucracy.",Don_Quixote81,2018-09-10T23:34:01Z,Good Omens,COMMENT,1

I found *Good Omens* to be largely ""meh,"" disliked *American Gods* as well, but absolutely adore the Discworld novels.  

The next question is always ""where to start?"" and my answer is much different than the prevailing wisdom (which is *Gaurds! Guards!*).  I suggest instead that you begin with The Tiffany Aching series, specifically *The Wee Free Men.*  It's a wonderful quick read and the following 3 books are equally perfect.  From there you can go on to any Discworld book, either in chronological order or perfectly randomly.

That said, if your issue with Good Omens is lack of cohesiveness, you might not fare much better with Discworld. A lot of the Discworld novels have an A plot and B plot (sometimes even a C plot) with a lot of flip-flopping between the plot threads. The storylines usually do 'come together' by the end though, and the books make for good re-reading because it's fun to pick up on all the foreshadowing and other details I missed out on the first time.

Also, if you're going to start with The Witches stream, I'd probably skip the first book, Equal Rites. One of my least favorites. I thought Pratchett dealt with women's rights / feminism in a really heavy-handed way in that book, and there just weren't a lot of laughs compared to his other works. All of the other Witches books are wonderful though, and the Tiffany Aching series is a lot of fun too.

I've been re-reading a lot of the earlier books recently, and I will say that Pratchett seems to get more cohesive as he went along.  the early books were very narratively skittish, and it's not usually until the last hundred pages that you get the big picture.

15zra9w_2,15zra9w,"I wholeheartedly agree with your points.

For me the best example of good and gone-wrong adaptations is the ""The Secret Garden"":

The 1980s version is way too faithful to the book, following every plot point exactly, which makes it seem kinda stiff because it's missing context/atmosphere which is not conveyed through just the plot itself and doesn't connect the different scenes as would be necessary for a smooth experience.

The 1993 adaptation of the book is perfect. Every change made adds something important and they cut away scenes which are a bit repetitive, irrelevant or only work in a book. Plus, the cast, soundtrack and cinematography are just amazing. In my opinion it's really a masterclass in adaptation. The movie doesn't only keep the spirit/meaning of the book, but even enhances and expands on it.

And the 2020 version is just any mediocre children's movie with a dog (that doesn't exist in the book, but is somehow the most important thing in that movie), which they called ""The Secret Garden"" despite there not even being emphasis on any kind of secret garden.

&#x200B;

An honorable mention is ""Whale Rider"". It's mostly faithful to the book, but changes one thing that wouldn't have worked due to the different format. Incredible movie for a good book in my opinion.

aj8g1o_8,aj8g1o,I am so glad someone finally made a post about this.  In 7th grade my English teacher had a poster of the book in his classroom and I asked him what the poster is for.  He told me about the book and then I decided to buy it.  I attempted to read it but was unable to do so at first.  Then many years later I decided to give it another shot and then realized my mother decided to give the book away.  I went out to buy another copy and finally managed to get through the whole book.  Tough to get started on reading it but once you're determined enough to read the whole thing you realize it was worth it.  It's not only humorous but also insightful about how peoples minds worked in the war.  I then went on to read the sequel Closing Time afterwards.

1alsfo2_6,1alsfo2,"I read *Catch-22* multiple times in high school. I was fascinated by it, and liked it, but didn't really *get it.* I kept reading it hoping that I decode it, figure out why it effected me so much, and fascinated me so much. Every time I read it, I would see something else, but I still couldn't really explain why it had the effect on me that it did.

And then I read David Milch's memoir last year (Milch is a TV writer most famous for *Deadwood* and *NYPD Blue*) and he wrote this passage about a class on writing that he used to teach at Yale:

> What I was trying to teach was the idea that the reader or the audience's experience of a work, how they feel as they go through it, is what conveys the work's argument, and that experience is usually different from the actual words. Another way of saying it is that form shapes content. With *Moby-Dick,* your faculties of understanding are exhausted by the work itself, and it's by having your faculties totally and utterly exhausted that you can feel Ahab's obession with the whale and Ishmael's obsession with the story. ""I'm taking it all in and I'm overwhelmed and I'm still not sure exactly what it means."" That's what it means. Henry James uses a different tactic--he introduces a new character to the world and then through that character's misapprehension the reader comes to apprehend the world more clearly.
>
> This was a writing class, but I went into it through reading. It's too much for a young student to constantly be looking at their or their classmates' work. If you bring something already taken for granted as literature and you workshop that, then we can have some fun. To suggest that our greatest writers might have been struggling with our same feelings, which we know for a fact they were, is a good thing for a writer to live into. There are ways to turn problems of spirit into problems of technique--that's another kind of indirection. Kafka was just a miserable, miserable human being. Pathologically shy and physically ill, but he wanted to tell stories. So Gregor Samsa woke up and discovered he was a bug. All of his misery is now a problem of technique. How does a bug live in a family where the rest are human beings?

And I get it. I understand the structure and impact of Catch 22 so much better than before.

Catch-22 is one of the main reasons I have trouble reading books today. Not so much trouble as that I never read books—I still read books. But I grew up only reading the great books. At home and in school, every book we read was a classic, something spectacular. 

Well, most books aren't spectacular, aren't classics, obviously. Many of them are very good, and very entertaining, but once I'd gone through many of the classics and was trying to find other books to read, I was let down a lot. Every book I pick up, I expect to be The Hobbit, or Catch-22, or One Hundred Years of Solitude, or All Quiet on the Western Front. Of course they can't all be that, but I am always disappointed. 

Not every movie I see has to be Breaker Morant or Fitzcarraldo. Not every TV show has to be The Prisoner or Faulty Towers. Maybe because I grew up watching good and bad movies, serious and silly movies and shows, mediocre ones as well. My expectations are realistic. But with books, they were all amazing. And my expectations were set very high. I didn't read a ""bad"" book until after college.

1alsfo2_24,1alsfo2,"More like the book allows us to see the humour that we wouldn't see in real life. 

That saying goes ""Comedy is tragedy that happens to other people"" , and that's true. We hardly see the humour in daily life, because daily life directly affects us. Catch-22 (and Yossarian) is great at putting a buffer between the reader and the awfulness until it all comes to a  head in the penultimate chapter (which is when Yossarian actually takes stock), and gets somewhat resolved in the last one.",BeerEater1,2024-02-08T15:55:48Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,24

1alsfo2_30,1alsfo2,"I mean, a portion of the second part is true, except for (for example) the part about ""pouring money into pride parades"" which is where it veers off the rails into bigoted delusions, but the ostensible anti-elitist ""right"" wants to solve that issue with the wealthy and corporations having too much power by ... uh, giving them enormous tax cuts and protecting the Citizens United decision that grants them unlimited political influence?

The supposed ""anti-elitism"" on the right is a complete lie. It's just a reaction to a society where they're not allowed to call their coworkers a ""faggot"" anymore, as evidenced by how their greatest ""anti-elite"" champion is a billionaire New Yorker who shits in a gold toilet and spent a lifetime deeply ensconced in the world of celebrity cults ... just because he says outrageous transgressive bullshit that makes weak people feel briefly powerful. They're not anti-elitist, they're anti-decency. Their overriding concern is that society should validate their cruelty, and when it doesn't, it's a grand conspiracy by the ""elites.""

1alsfo2_32,1alsfo2,"There are moments of sheer gold in *Closing Time*, but very few of them are of the standard you consistently find in *Catch-22*. There's definitely some disappointment in it being so inferior ... But it's still hard to say no. You might be best reading a few of Heller's other books - *God Knows* and *Portrait of the Artist as an Old Man* will help - to get a better feel for what to expect.

Really disliked *Good As Gold* the first time I read it, but ended up reading it another couple of times afterwards. Expect I've remember the positives and forgetten the negatives. 

And I'll put my hand up for rating *Something Happened* as highly as *Catch-22* - but inexplicably different from it. If it's darkness and brutality you want, you'll find it there, but again, in a completely different form. The ending is unforgettable.

188tsot_3,188tsot,"Catch-22 is probably my favorite book, but I will fully admit that it is not for everyone. There is not any sort of great narrative shift where it turns into a linear story, so, if you are waiting for that, temper your expectations :) (and maybe it just isn't the book for you. Nothing wrong with that).

But!!!

While the style remains the same, it is kind of like puzzle pieces that are randomly dropping into place. After 12% of the pieces fall, you look at it and say ""WTF is this, it makes no sense"". But as more and more of the puzzle pieces fall, they are still random, but they begin to fill in the picture, and you see more and more of the whole. And as you get to the end it all comes together and you see all these interconnected parts that were randomly dropped in.

This is how it happened to me, at least, and I loved it, and it was a hilarious ride getting there. But as I said, not everyone has the same experience. If you are only 12% of the way in, I would recommend giving it another little bit until you are at least 20% or 30%. If you still think it is terrible, drop it. Like I said, it isn't for everyone.

The other advice I would give is to not view it as a ""running joke about how crazy everyone is"". The characters aren't crazy; they are living in a crazy situation, and it affects all of them differently. A good example that comes to mind is Yossarian's argument with Clevinger about how ""Everyone is trying to kill him"". Depending on your point of view, either Yossarian or Clevinger (or both) seem crazy. But actually neither of them say anything that isn't true.

wr2kpx_1,wr2kpx,"I think may be reading *just* a bit too far into it.  But I also don't think Heller would be upset about your conclusions.  I believe he was interested in writing a book that had broad themes and satire and could be used as small spotlight on any absurd issue.

Just a note on Sweden.  It was not socialist at the time, nor is it socialist today.  It is a social democracy which is based on capitalism.  The role Sweden plays in the book is more general and mainly that Sweden is *neutral* and wants no part of the war, which is how Yossarian himself feels.  

The book itself is a broad satire and in general is about the extreme absurd-ism that is the military and bureaucracy.  It points out the concept of promoting problems up (ie it is easier to promote someone to get rid of them, then it is to actually remove them), miscommunication, ego, greed, etc.  

Then the ultimatum theme is personal integrity vs institution.  Yossarian tries to follow personal integrity and he looks for it in others, but he keeps coming up against the institution with it's ""Catch-22"".  Only the institution really gets to use Catch-22 though, individuals are always at the whim of the institution and are not able to use Catch-22.  The is really the main point and the book goes out of its way to keep selling that point.  The other points are just added on fun for the book.",No0ther0ne,2022-08-18T00:15:11Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1

The Sellout, My Year of Rest and Relaxation, Lightning Rods, Then We Came to the End, Money, Portnoy's Complaint, American Psycho... I think all of these are very funny books.

The problem is: humor is subjective. I'm sure lots of people don't think the books I've listed are funny. That doesn't mean they *aren't* funny.

I thought so too when I first read Catch-22, but now, having read it a second time just recently, I have to disagree. That Catch-22 feels arbitrary and not coherent is really a testament to how well-structured it is. 

It can seem convoluted at first read, but really it isn't all that confusing. The first sequence of chapters takes place in the present, then the book flashes back to the big bombing of Bologna, then it jumps forward back to the narrative present, then flashes back, then flashes forward, climaxing with another flashback back to the death of Snowden, which haunts Yossarian throughout. 

This sequence of events allows Heller to keep Catch-22 light and absurd, all while consistently ramping up the darkness at the heart of the book. By the time of the sudden murder of the sex worker in Italy, it's almost like getting a bucket of cold water thrown in your face

I honestly can't get over this book. What hooked me was the wild way each chapter seemingly connects to the following one. Everything feels connected, not arbitrary at all",chiroozu,2022-10-24T00:12:51Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,5

tx68jt_3,tx68jt,"""Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane *if* he didn't \[...\]""

A clever detail about the writing here is that Heller has hidden the fact that this is a conditional statement by burying the ""if"" until later sentences. 

Notice how the end of the paragraph is littered with the word ""if"", as if snowballing:

""...but *if* he was sane he had to fly them. *If* he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but *if* he didn't want to he was sane and had to.""

It builds wonderful tension because we get more frustrated with each condition!

""Orr was crazy and could be grounded."" really isn't being *asserted* as a statement of fact, but Heller's gone out of his way to make it *appear* so in order to create an element of surprise. 

If the statement ""Orr was crazy and could be grounded"" were true then Orr would also have to be able to be grounded, which the book makes clear he isn't because of Catch-22. 

Orr *might* be crazy given that statement *if* it weren't for the paradoxical nature of the Catch-22.

Because the Catch-22 has no resolution, it's always resolved in the favor of those in power, so Orr factually is never grounded, and therefore the conjunction that ""Orr was crazy and could be grounded"" is false.

Therefore, we can't make any inference about the atomic statement ""Orr is crazy"".

jomuc0_1,jomuc0,"I read it in college and while I definitely didn't ""hate"" it, I wasn't taken by it. Much of what people in this thread have noted about repetitiveness has been said, but I'll agree with it. Being intentionally tedious isn't much better than unintentionally tedious. And the same joke premise gets stale no matter how funny it is.

I also think I don't connect to the style/themes of the book very strongly. Absurdism rarely works for me as a reader; it makes it hard for me to care. I found it similarly frustrating to read Slaughterhouse 5, another Reddit favorite. Absurdist lit just feels cynical in a very unlikable way. It asks the reader to do work in parsing the story, but ultimately the reward for the work is a middle finger, because the story will never really make total sense. I understand that this is a sort of meta-commentary on the painful needlessness of war, but it's not a ride I feel like signing myself up on.

To be clear, I don't think Catch-22 is a ""bad book"". It has real humor and intelligence and ideas, and even I enjoyed moments of it. I just find it difficult to connect to on the whole. I'm more than willing to read a bleak war novel, but the hyper-jaded, sardonic narrator felt too unlikable for me to connect with emotionally and too repetitive for me to invest in intellectually.",Jamarcus_Hustle,2020-11-05T20:33:49Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1

I think most people read the first chapter or two and assume that this is a flaw in the writing, not an intentional technique and give up too early.

There was an animated movie in the early 2000s (Hoodwinked) that used a similar storytelling technique and I thought it was great but no matter who I loaned the DVD to, they invariably said they just couldn't get into it. I think they watched the first part and when it went back to the beginning of the story to tell it from another character's point of view, they somehow felt like it had tricked them or wasted their time.

I loved the satirical story and anti-war theme, but I also remember being blown away by how Heller was poking fun at me the reader, just like Yossarian was messing with the officers above him.  


Without giving it away for anyone who hasn't read it yet, there was a point I pulled out my dictionary after seeing the same word I didn't really understand for like ... the 5th time. When I saw the definition of the word I realized that both I and the character in the book Yossarian had been using it on were both being mocked by not actually knowing what the word meant but going forward as if we did.   


I put the book down, and audibly said ""Wow ... "".

jqs8gk_13,jqs8gk,"Catch-22 is definitely one of my favourite books of all time. It's just my kind of humour, although it's the juxtaposition of the funny and the tragic is what does it for me. I'm laughing so hard one minute, the next I'm wondering why is the death of these man (who pretty much die one by one) and the monstrosities of war so funny for me.

However I'm wondering about one thing. Is Snowden's >!death!< widely considered the climax of the book? Because I don't think it really is. It's just there to put the actual emotional climax of the book, the >!raping and killing of prostitute!< by the good old Aarfy in Rome is the actual climax of the book. The Snowden bit is there to put it all into perspective. The sheer absurdity of considering one being innocent or guilty in the time of war, human life having no value (they're all pretty much there to go through the moves), it all comes to a climax during that one last trip to Rome.

And I believe the reason people tend to miss this on their first reading is because it's IMMEDIATELY undercut by the military police taking Yossarian into custody due to him being AWOL.

Anyone else has similar thoughts about this?",glootech,2020-11-09T15:28:10Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,13

If you love Catch-22 then you'll enjoy it for sure. It's much darker, sadder and realistic than its prequel. It's sad to see the humorous, energetic characters that I loved from Catch-22 ageing and dealing with late life but that's also the challenge of this book. It forces you to deal with the pattern of life and it uncompromisingly compares the harshness of war with the harshness of banal domestic life. 

I would say Catch-22 captures the chaotic, bizarre, weirdly humorous world of war where nothing makes sense once you start questioning and you just don't understand it. But Closing Time describes the strange, confusing world of growing up and ageing where nothing makes sense and no one understands you anymore.

However, I had a similar experience reading Catch-22. I tried to read it several times and never made it past ~100 pages. When I had to try again for a class, I made it just beyond my previous stopping points and something just clicked. I finished the next few hundred pages in a day. 

The characters are completely absurd but they all have different motives. Some want to profit from the war. Some want promotions. Some are just horny kids. Some are so convinced that they will die that they'll do anything to go home, while some don't fear death at all.

Like you said, the book is funny. Heller's writing style is such that you get lulled into the hilarious chaos the wild cast of characters keep getting into and you wonder what's the point... and then thebadshit happens and you are struck by how real the violence and terror is that they all suddenly find themselves in.

o6zf61_38,o6zf61,"Well, it's boot camp, which can be considered 8 weeks of engineered hazing. That's just how it is. It's all about being uncomfortable, doing only what you've been told to do, and purposeful chaos. The training isn't designed to make you happy, it's to get you ready for life in the military, which means the possibility of being in war, which is uncomfortable and chaotic. To be fair, we did get to occasionally wear the raincoats, but it had to be a heavy rain, and we had to be outside in it for quite a while before they'd tell us to put them on.   


The blanket situation really was a Catch-22 deal. It really wasn't a blanket (they called it that), it was an extra sheet. And it had to be rolled into something like a plank of wood, very precisely, and kept it a very specific manner at the foot of the bed when not in use. We found out quickly that there just wasn't enough time to perform this exercise in origami every morning. From the time reveille sounded, we had exactly 12 minutes to get up, use the toilet, shave, brush our teeth, get dressed (including lacing up canvas WW2 style leggings-this was in the '80s), make our rack (bunk), and be outside in formation, ready to march to breakfast. This is 80 guys all doing this and trying to use 2 toilets and 2 sinks (we had more of both, but didn't use them so that we didn't have to clean all of them). So, taking the 2 or 3 minutes to get that damn sheet just right wasn't in the cards. It was better to shiver all night than to not make it to muster. At sea, you have 12 minutes to make it to your battle station from the moment the general quarters alarm sounds. At 12 minutes, all the watertight doors are sealed, and if you didn't make it through that last door and to your station, it's...a big deal. So, this 12 minute time frame is something the Navy is serious as shit about, and it was practiced every morning in boot camp.",tomcat_tweaker,2021-06-24T23:40:35Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,38

There are a few books I return to over the years and reread, and Catch-22 is one of them. It’s still just as funny the fifth time through, enough to make you laugh out loud on the metro. The cover is quite recognizable so when people notice the book, there is often a smile of complicity in the hilarity of it all.

Secondly, the book is propaganda for living life.  Over and over, you see the value of a humans life and how military situations can manipulate its value.  Yossarian basically says, it doesn't matter whose life we're talking about or how important that person is, a life is a life and it has an inherent amount of value. 

If you've ever worked anywhere that has a lot of management, you'll understand this book immediately.  He shows how military and large governmental bodies have asinine rules and basically get nothing done.  Often he's damned if he does one thing and damned if he does another (hence Catch-22).

>""You're wasting your time,"" Doc Daneeka was forced to tell him.
""Can't you ground someone who's crazy?""
""Oh, sure. I have to. There's a rule saying I have to ground anyone who's crazy.""

""Clevinger? Where is Clevinger? You find Clevinger and I'll ask him.""
""Then ask any of the others. They'll tell you how crazy I am.""
""They're crazy.""
""Then why don't you ground them?""
""Why don't they ask me to ground them?""
""Because they're crazy, that's why.""
""Of course they're crazy,"" Doc Daneeka replied. ""I just told you they're crazy, didn't I? And you can't let crazy people decide whether you're crazy or not, can you?""
Yossarian looked at him soberly and tried another approach. ""Is Orr crazy?""
""He sure is,"" Doc Daneeka said.
""Can you ground him?""
""I sure can. But first he has to ask me to. That's part of the rule.""
""Then why doesn't he ask you to?""
""Because he's crazy,"" Doc Daneeka said. ""He has to be crazy to keep flying combat missions after all the close calls he's had. Sure, I can ground Orr. But first he has to ask me to.
""That's all he has to do to be grounded?""
""That's all. Let him ask me.""
""And then you can ground him?"" Yossarian asked.
""No. Then I can't ground him.""

I'll cautiously suggest other books by Heller might make *Catch-22* more accessible. *Portrait of the Artist As An Old Man* might be the best place to start. It actually repeats and slowly builds on certain passages as it tells the story. In other words, the repetition is kind of built in.

*God Knows* and *Good As Gold* are definitely more accessible than *Catch-22*, while *Something Happened* and, for me at least, *Picture This* is in many ways even more difficult.

I would keep going a little longer. There may be certain things you need to understand about the book in order to 'get' it. Think about how all the characters and situations represent aspects of life that are absurd: see if you can apply them to situations in your own life. It's a funny book, but think carefully about the serious messages about society and war that lie underneath all the silliness.

That said, if and when you do give up, I'd recommend returning to it later in life. There are so many wonderful ideas within it just waiting for you to discover, but perhaps you're not at quite the right time to fully appreciate them. If you haven't read The Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy yet, I'd recommend reading that: it's got a similar style of humour to Catch-22 (though is more philosophical and less political) as well as a similar episodic structure, but is far more accessible.",FaerieStories,2015-08-07T17:48:04Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1

Catch-22 isn't a traditional ""hero's journey"" narrative so much as an attempt to convey the terror and idiocy of war, and Yossarian's a relatively passive protagonist without much agency who's mainly just there to act as a relatable and sane(ish) POV character that we follow along as he stumbles through a broken system full of broken people producing broken results.

So just sit back, enjoy the ride, and rest assured that Yossarian's fate is utterly meaningless.

Oh and also the big lesson here is that if you don't want spoilers you should never read the preface to a classic novel. They're always written on the assumption that everyone already knows how the book ends.",Fistocracy,2019-06-29T14:49:43Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1
hxfug_1,hxfug,"Hey man, yeah I actually read it earlier this year. I had mixed feelings.

In terms of style, it is about the most brilliant, original and intricately crafted thing I've ever come across. About a third of the way in I found myself regretting not having drawn a map as I went of everyone's relationship to everyone else.
While most narratives have a strictly linear feeling, Catch-22 is more like a *web*. That's the best way I can describe it, both in terms of plot and characters. Events and personalities are gradually strung together into a grand interconnected network to reveal the final picture. It's rather amazing.

The dark humour was mostly very effective, and the negative take on war moved me far more than Slaughterhouse 5 did.

One gripe was that the Milo Minderbinder side plot unexpectedly drags what is a plausible story (up to that point) into complete absurdity. *SPOILER ALERT* I'm talking about the part where Yossarian finds out Milo is the emperor and mayor etc of all these places. Milo's airstrike on the base also annoyed me in that he suffered no repercussions. I know it's in line with Heller's portrayal of war as insane, but it begged too great a suspension of disbelief.

We even find out that Milo is responsible for the dead man in Yossarian's tent. *He is killing his own people*, and they are okay with it because it's business. We have Minderbinder bombers in Catch-22, in real life we have GE torpedoes.

It belies the amorality of the whole enterprise. The power that Milo amasses is also similar to the power that corporations amass. They have control far beyond anything they should, and that is Milo in spades.

These are not easy things to pick up on, necessarily. I might recommend putting it down until you have a greater understanding of the language. But don't give up on it just yet! Sometimes it just takes time.

I don't believe there would be much of a cultural contextual issue. I think, actually, much of the references might pertain more to Italian culture than anything else. But I may be mistaken here, it has certainly been a while since I've read the book.

Chuckle and outrage with the main character, Yossarian.   Stewed with it's dark humor.  Listen to it's poetry.  Jump in to it's chaos mayhem.",alontree,2019-10-22T04:58:37Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1
dl6skn_2,dl6skn,"It took me 20 years to finish Catch-22. I kept picking it up and starting over and then seting it down. The plots were too disjointed, the jokes were too weird. I kept getting confused by the timeline and frustrated by how stupid everyone seemed.

This summer I finally finished it. Chalk it up to the patience that comes with age, but I did it. When you get through the last few chapters, the absurdity, chaos and confusion of the first part of the book comes into crystal clear focus for one of the biggest emotional payoffs that I've ever gotten out of a book.

I'm glad I didn't give up on it.",Pickels-,2019-10-21T22:58:44Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,2
dl6skn_3,dl6skn,"I thought Catch-22 was really funny, but a fair bit of the humor in it relies on cultural knowledge of the U.S. in the 1940s, and might just seem .... odd to somebody that isn't familiar with it.

I've tried reading Catch-22 along with a non-native speaker, and they were downright confused by huge swathes of it (despite generally excellent English skills).",snogglethorpe,2019-10-22T02:12:06Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,3
dl6skn_4,dl6skn,"Fully understand what you mean! I've heard Ian McEwan say Catch-22 shocked him by how unfunny it was once he reread it as an adult - having loved it years before.

It's whether you feel yourself into a novel or not. I enjoyed Catch-22 but wasn't impressed by it.

I, for instance, find that I can't read anything that's magical realism. I dropped Hundred Years of Solitude a few chapters from the end and gave up on Midnight's Children half way.

I understand why people like books I don't like but I also know precisely why I hate them. This exchange of impressions can be very interesting with serious people but completely pointless with others who don't accept the concept of taste.",Idiosincrasy,2019-10-22T11:44:12Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,4

dl6skn_7,dl6skn,"I agree. Sometimes you just need to be in the right mindset to enjoy something, and the feel of the story is sometimes more important than the actual plot (especially in the case of ""Catch-22"" where chaos and confusion are some of the main themes).

""Easily Deluded Reader: Look at all the subtext. This must be one of the greatest anti-war pieces of our time.""

On a more serious note...

My interpretation is that the ending is not supposed to be some grand revelation.  Catch-22 is emblematic of the system and circumstances that created it.  The ""game"" is rigged.  The only way for Yossarian to win is to not play (hence, desertion). ",mctoasterson,2014-06-30T16:46:47Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1

4mj991_1,4mj991,"In Catch-22 there is a background of idiot bureaucratic aggression, meant to mirror an existence that is mindless yet determined to destroy.

The nameless, faceless person is probably talking about 'Dunbar' who they 'disappeared'. There is no real reason for it. As Yossarian says, it isn't even good English. 

""Nately's Whore"" is less symbolic. She is meant to be a person, not a faceless figure. Someone who lost her love; and as Yossarian supposes, needs someone to hate about it. 
 
The key to Catch-22 is the return again and again to Snowden, dying, and what Yossarian realized staring at the ripped open body:  ""The spirit dead, man is garbage.""

Nately's Whore saved Yossarian by almost killing him, making him face the fact that selling out to Korn and Cathcart would destroy his spirit. He'd be dead, in the only sense that justifies being alive.

4mj991_2,4mj991,"By 'saving' I mean it in a Catch-22 way.

Yossarian realizes that if he sells out, he loses his soul. He becomes just so much pounds of clay. 

This is Heller's real catch-22: the final one he presents to Yossarian and the reader. **To save yourself, you must be willing to give up your life.**

In the hospital after the stabbing, he gets a last chance to affirm it. He has that great conversation with Danby and the Chaplain, basically recapitulating the theme.

>""You must do whatever you think is right, then.""<

>""Don't worry,"" Yossarian said with a sorrowful laugh after several moments has passed. ""I'm not going to do it.""<


It is significant that the last sentence in the novel is Yossarian leaping away from Natalie's Whore's knife again. She is become the threat to life, that makes a man realize the value of his soul. ",AQUIETDAY,2016-06-04T22:34:20Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,2

With the exception of Picture This and God Knows, his other novels also won critical plaudits, especially Closing Time, which was a bold step. Yet Heller claims to be resigned to the fact that people are forever pointing out that he hasn't written anything like Catch-22 since and has a stock response. 'I always say, ""Neither has anyone else.""'

It's a nice mix of great comedy and sad, dark war, and not as zany and ridiculous as Vonnegut's mix of absurdity and reality.

Almost everyone stops somewhere in the middle, because the repetitiveness gets to be laborious, even if the constant joking is amusing. But those who pick it up again and finish it are almost universally glad they did. It's an amazing literary achievement, a very funny book about both death and bureaucracy.

j6x4a_1,j6x4a,"That was pretty well written, and Rosenbaum's esteem for the novel is palpable, but I disagree with his point. Primarily I feel that this deconstruction, which claims to basically reclassify the novel thematically, is a little weak. I mean, Rosenbaum would have us believe that the book is primary about a theme which only appears explicitly in one chapter, with no other exposition the author can find? I guess you could say that Heller had to set the mood in order for his message to be received but that is a stretch that I would hasten to call 'intellectually bankrupt'. Sure, the whole theistic argument is in the book and it may be a small theme but I think it is connected to a larger issue that Ron as well as most people miss about the book. 

Catch-22 isn't so much about the war, or about morality, as it is about (as Rosenbaum even eludes to) authority, an hierarchies. Even if you want to discuss the theme of morality that is definitely still in the novel you have to understand that Yossarian isn't supposed to be a paragon in the classic sense. Yossarian is a hero not because he does what is morally right, but because he is the person who is deciding, from his point of view, what is right. Not anyone else, Yossarian. Not only that, but once he makes the determination he acts on it. ",camwinter,2011-08-03T02:40:02Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1
j6x4a_2,j6x4a,"It's interesting, but this is generally what I felt like was the core of the book when I first read it. Yes, it's a condemnation of all wars through the ""good war"". But a denunciation of war would never have the power that *Catch-22* has, no matter how delightfully dark and absurd. More importantly, it is the ultimate sardonic take on power and authority–and the ultimate power and authority is God. It's what makes the build-up to Snowden's ""terrible secret"" that spills all over the floor so meaningful. ""Man is matter."" 

I'm actually surprised the author of the linked article doesn't explore this essentially materialist undercurrent to the entire novel more than the more overt denunciations of God. ",willbb,2011-08-04T02:55:39Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,2
24cy6z_1,24cy6z,"CATCH-22 is masterful in so many ways. It begins as comic farce, proceeds to the increasingly surreal, and then transforms into a nightmarish tragedy before ending triumphantly. No novel that I know so successfully blends all these disparate moods. I believe it was Hugh Walpole who wrote, ""Life is a comedy to those who think, and a tragedy to those who feel."" No book illustrates that better than this novel. This truly is one of the funniest books I have ever read. It is also one of the most tragic.

CATCH-22 also introduces one of the most insane collection of great characters in fiction: Yossarian, the Chaplain, Orr, ex-P.F.C Wintergreen, Milo Minderbender, Maj. Major Major Major, Nately, Doc Daneeka, Danby, General Dreedle, Nately's girl (not the description in the book, but Amazon's software will bleep it), Cathcart, Nurse Duckett, The Texan, Major ----- de Coverley, The Soldier in White, and a host of other characters. It is one of the most gloriously populated novels of the past half century.

This is a novel I can almost not discuss except through superlatives: greatest war novel I have read, funniest novel I have ever read, greatest English language novel of the past 60 years. But the best thing is that it is, on top of being a superb book, an exceedingly fun book to read. Even at its nightmarish, this is a fun, delightful book. And few novels contain as many unforgetable moments as this one.",builder_,2014-04-30T13:18:21Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1
24cy6z_2,24cy6z,"""There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane, he had to fly them. If he flew them, he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to, he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.

""That's some catch, that Catch-22,"" he observed.

""It's the best there is,"" Doc Daneeka agreed.""

They told him never to put off until the next day what he could do the day before, and he never did. He was told to honor his father and his mother, and he honored his father and his mother. He was told that he should not kill, and he did not kill, until he got into the Army. Then he was told to kill, and he killed. He turned the other cheek on every occasion and always did unto others exactly as he would have had others do unto him. When he gave to charity, his left hand never knew what his right hand was doing. He never once took the name of the Lord his God in vain, committed adultery or coveted his neighbor's ass. In fact, he loved his neighbor and never even bore false witness against him.

24cy6z_25,24cy6z,"At the risk of committing the grave sin of Explaining The Joke, the dialog is actually about a very profound difference in world views.

Yossarian's view is simple: people are shooting at me, ergo they are trying to kill me.

His adversary (don't remember his name) is trying to explain that it's not murder but war, and that they're not trying to kill Yossarian specifically, but any US soldier.

To Yossarian, this distinction is immaterial: call it war or murder, call him Yossarian or ""any US soldier"", he's still ending up dead.

Yossarian is right of course, but the army (and society at large) doesn't want him to think that way and tries to present his risk of getting killed in some formal and rephrased way, to make it sound OK. The other guy completely buys into this view and gets exasperated by Yossarian's straightforward and undeniable logic.

In high school, my English teacher gave me a good grade for pointing out that Catch-22 is not just about war, the military and death; it's about society in general and about conformism. I think you can apply Yossarian's logic to lots of things in your daily life (and drive the non-Yossarians of this world to despair while doing so).",zeptimius,2014-05-02T09:39:27Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,25

I would also posit that part of the brilliance of Catch-22 is that unlike most of those listed above, the surrealism is almost entirely grounded in a sense of real possibility. That's the pathos.

215dbd_1,215dbd,"Sorry for the thread crap, but I think Catch-22 is unfilmable. The Mike Nichols Movie proves this for me. It does a great job capturing the atmosphere of claustrophobia and terror, but the humor falls almost completly flat. At first, I wondered why that is, I thought the funny dialogues were already in the book. But now I think the rythm of the dialogues can't be reproduced on film. Much of the humor depends on ""catch"" phrases beeing repeated verbatim, but changing their meaning everytime. Sometimes the same phrases are repeated right back several times in one conversation.

A reader needs less time each repetition to read the words of the text; he already knows the sentence. He has more time to ponder the changing of tone or meaning. This makes the reading of the dialogues fast and funny. But when said aloud, each repetition takes the same time as before. As the Mike Nichols movie shows, this makes the dialogues extremely slow. The humour loses its rythm, that is to say, the humour is lost. The Nichols movie tried to compensate this by a frantic, overwinded delivery. Needless to say, it doesn't work. So an adaption would have to change what is imo the most important stylistic device of the book to have a chance at being funny. ",gromolko,2014-03-23T18:49:47Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1

The eternal city chapter at the end is the holocaust and yossarian watches it happen unable to prevent it (representing outside world watching holocaust)

A lot of times when I am reading a difficult or dense book, I'll have dictionary.com or something open. It's immeasurably helpful for fully understanding what's happening. If you come across a word you don't understand, you can usually infer its meaning from the context, but a lot of times it's more ambiguous. This way you get an actual definition, and you're increasing your vocabulary. It can be especially helpful if I'm reading something written even like 50+ years ago. Certain words, especially common vernacular, come in and out of fashion almost as fast as clothes. So it can be difficult to get the full context with something written just a few decades ago. A quick search can clear up a lot of confusion.

If you're reading for the characters and dialogue instead of some big, overarching, unifying narrative, I think you will find the book to be much more enjoyable.

90okad_8,90okad,"Catch-22 was one of the few assigned classics that I fell in love with in high school. That being said, I have two comments on why you may not enjoy it as I did. First, and I saw something similar in an earlier post, the “classic” tag can set many up for failure. Classic seems to indicate a universal love and respect for a work, when honestly I feel that the adjective is bantered about too recklessly. I work at a bookstore and had a discussion about a supposed “classic” with a customer. She said, “...but its a CLASSIC!” To which I replied, “Why is it a classic?” “Because it ENDURED.” And again I questioned, “Yes, but perhaps it has only endured because it was labeled classic and people think that they must read it.” My point is, I think the term classic is subjective. I honestly detest most commonly considered classics. I mean seriously, Hemingway? I’ll fight you over that one. I threw Joseph Conrad across the room in the middle of class. 
Secondly, back to Catch-22, its a comedy, dark, satirical, dry humor. If there is anything in this world more subjective than humor, I’m not sure what it is. If the book doesn’t work for you, there are a few million others to choose from. 
Ona side note- for those who read this and are fans of the book- try Nick Harkaway’s amazing The Goneaway World. You will thank me. Very similar construction and texture. ",RobertKenton,2018-07-21T12:30:02Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,8

Sure, other authors also wrote against its horrors (Remarque, Hemingway, Trumbo,) but most of hollywood and the general population loved to glorify war as dying for your country and bravery, while Keller wrote about just how brutal it really is. 

He wants to say that people should not try to be heroes in war. It's random and pointless and crazy and you're lucky to just be alive for how long you have been. Yossarian finally realizes he can't just not do anything about his situation. He has to get out of this before his luck runs out.

brtuao_1,brtuao,"Spoilers, maybe? - but anybody in this thread must have read the book already, I hope.

  
Catch-22 is my favorite book, and one I was very cautiously optimistic to see adapted by Hulu. I've seen the movie version before and found it low-energy, but mostly faithful to the plot. Hulu's miniseries is kind of the opposite - it's high energy and very well acted, but takes some big liberties with the plot to keep the themes intact. I think our present-day culture has pretty much internalized the whole ""War is Hell"" concept and so the show lands in a very different place socially than the book did, when criticizing the military was far edgier a stand to take. Overall I liked the Hulu series as a stand-alone work, but the differences between the book and the show bothered me more than I hoped they would. I think it gets the broad strokes of Heller's ideas/themes right but does so at the expense of a lot of the nuance that the book contains. Things are just too pat, too cause-and-effect, and you lose the chaotic sense of ambiguity that the book forces you to navigate with its scattered, scrambled chronology. The show makes it seem like there is a clear villain, while the book makes it more like a faceless system that is to blame.

543gso_1,543gso,"Bruh. Keep reading it. I'm no good with labels and themes, but if your looking for a book that questions the absolute insanity that is warfare, you've got in your hands a prime example of it. I always picture dystopian books as depressing caricatures of the future if a lesson isn't learned or listened to (kinda like 1984 and those kinds of books), but the point of Catch-22 is something similar even if it's set in the past. Every single character in that book is warped in their own way, and brings another aspect of the war forward. It's a crazy book, just look at Major (Major Major) Major. My advice is don't give up on it early because the overall meaning of the Catch-22 really becomes a focal point later on, and I think that can count as a dystopian novel.

A man, and the world, is stuck in a war that is constantly offering up horrors that the characters cannot escape no matter what they do. Living in a catch-22.

msicp_1,msicp,"I started to really enjoy Catch-22 (I fell quite in love with the book, actually) once I was able to identify the themes and see (what I thought was) Heller's intention with the novel. Heller wants to show you how increasingly frustrating it is to deal with bureaucracy and those in charge. 

Heller was examining how it is practically impossible for the everyday wo/man to come up against the powers that be and try to get something accomplished, or change something for what he or she deems as the better.  

The book, as enjoyable as it was, was infuriating, and I couldn't help but feel like an awful cynical bastard for a period of time after reading it. It had a similar effect on me as did Kafka's The Trial.

So... no. As you read further, it doesn't get any more serious. Re read it in a few years though, and you'll be stunned to remember that it seemed carefree once.

For example, one of those absurd digressions in the book is the most apt critique of self proclaimed and righteous conservatives I've read to date:

>Major Major’s father was a sober God-fearing man whose idea of a good joke was to lie about his age. He was a longlimbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism. He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn’t earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major’s father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money and was therefore wise. “As ye sow, so shall ye reap,” he counseled one and all, and everyone said, “Amen.”

>Major Major’s father was an outspoken champion of economy in government, provided it did not interfere with the sacred duty of government to pay farmers as much as they could get for all the alfalfa they produced that no one else wanted or for not producing any alfalfa at all. He was a proud and independent man who was opposed to unemployment insurance and never hesitated to whine, whimper, wheedle and extort for as much as he could get from whomever he could.

I've read Catch-22 twice, once in college and once when I was in my 30s, and my view of it was very different. In college, I thought it was hilariously funny. In my 30s, I was stunned to find that it was a depressing statement on the state ofwars and the nations that inflict them. There's a _lot_ more there than the comedy. In my very humble opinion, it's a good book if you read it as a comedy, and it's a very good book if you read through the comedy to the premise Heller starts with.

May I suggest that instead of ""getting it"" we switch frames and ask if the book is speaking to you. Picasso just doesn't speak to me, so I don't ""get"" his works. If Heller's book isn't speaking to you, it's just not meant for you as the reader. No reflection on Heller, no reflection on you. You might wait 10 or 15 years and see if it speaks to you then.

Art is a dialogue, I digress to say. The author ""vests"" his painting, play, novel, whatever, with himself. He speaks to us through his work. But we bring our own train of baggage with us when we view, watch, read the author's work. We fund the work with our own knowledge, history, and experiences. If the author's self and our selves match to some extent, if we can fund the work as he vested it, then through the work of art, the author and we have a conversation. We fund -- fill in the blanks -- the work with ourselves, as the author vested the work with himself. If there's no match ([Picasso and me](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064808/combined)), there's no conversation.

1fa73l_7,1fa73l,"Hi!

I don't mean to intrude, but...

I think Heller means that the novel uses the same characters, but the story itself is not an expansion on Catch-22's story. The events of Catch-22-- Aarfy killing the whore, the founding of Milo & Minderbinder enterpises--still happened in the same universe, but this story hasn't anything to do with these events. Sure, the characters are the same, but their actions are not directly related to the events in Catch-22, which is why Heller has labeled Closng Time as a continuation rather than a sequel.

Could the definition of sequel sill incorporate Heller's continuation? Maybe. However, joshthecynic was not contesting you on that point. Specifically, he said that Heller was not trying to sell Closing Time as a sequel. Whther or not it actually was a sequel is irrelevant to what Josh was saying. What matters is what Heller was trying to sell.

660gmm_1,660gmm,"Welcome to *Catch-22*! It's a book I've read at least a dozen times and I could happily read it again tonight.

The chapters are short, so you're not very far in, but if you're getting a feeling of craziness, you're on the right track. 

I'll try not to spoil anything for you, you haven't even met Catch-22 yet, but I'll give you some tips.

First, the narrative is not necessarily straightforward. It kind of bounces around. There's a line you can sort of follow, and a definite end to the book, but be prepared for jumps in the timeline.

Second, the theme of ""craziness"" is important. What does it mean to be ""crazy?"" Is the concept of war crazy? In a way, yes it is.   

Yossarian lives in a tent on a nice Medeterranean island. Every few days, he has to climb into a bomber and fly off to get shot at and drop bombs on people. Is that ""normal?"" Why? 

Have you ever experienced a moment in your life where you suddenly just stopped and wondered ""*Why* am I doing this?""  
I have to get up at a certain time and go to school and wear certain clothes and follow certain rules and study certain subjects and act like it's all important. Is it really? Everybody else seems to go along with it. Am I crazy? Are they?

Yossarian has the same feelings, but his are compounded by the brutal terror of war. People are dying in horrible bloody ways for some reason. Everybody seems to be going along with it. Is this normal?  Is Yossarian crazy for *not* wanting to fly off and get shot at? 

The characters around Yossarian have various personalities. Some seem truly insane, others seem remarkably well-adjusted to the realities of war. Who are the crazy ones? The ones who seem legitimately mad, or the ones who can treat the horror of war as a normal thing?

It's kind of like the mental exercise of trying to explain the rules of life on this planet to a space alien, or to a newborn baby. We have certain customs which we all follow that are probably there for a good reason, but no one can actually explain the importance of. 

Yossarian is in the place of that that newborn baby. It's no accident that (to us) his story opens in a hospital, and his first feeling is love. Outside the walls of the hospital is a terrifying, deadly world that he must try to make sense of, but maybe that world doesn't make sense at all.

How do you live in a crazy world? Do you go crazy yourself to fit in, or do you try to stay sane and have the world call *you* crazy?  
That's some catch, that Catch-22.",PaulsRedditUsername,2017-04-18T04:50:07Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1
224r01_1,224r01,"What about Yossarian's squadron number, the fighting 256th? 

>'That's two to the fighting eighth power,' Yossarian pointed out, 'if you're thinking of writing a symbolic poem about our squadron.'

edit: *Catch-22* is my favorite book and I would also really like to get a tattoo for it, but I hate text tattoos and haven't found a decent enough image to get. I'd want something more subtle, something that people who've read the book would sort of recognize, but not something like the red Yossarian on the cover.",natelyswhore22,2014-04-04T13:58:19Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1

yexxc_1,yexxc,"I absolutely loved this book. One thing that stuck out to me about it was how it started off fairly light in its absurdity, but slowly progressed toward a much darker/cynical view of life. This progression also reflects our increasing knowledge of the incident with Snowden, and our understanding of how this has affected Yossarian. However, I loved that when things seemed the darkest, and Yossarian is truly trapped in a Catch-22, we discover Orr's success in his flight to Sweden. I thought it was a beautiful thematic arc, developing the theme of ""catch 22,"" our control over our own destiny, and the futility of trying to control it, and then revealing this beautiful triumph. It brings hope to the reader as well as Yossarian. In case you can't tell, I really loved this book :)",,2012-08-18T06:39:51Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,1

3ly0p0_2,3ly0p0,"Here's something I wrote on the Mike Nichols movie a while ago .

>Sorry for the thread crap, but I think Catch-22 is unfilmable. The Mike Nichols Movie proves this for me. It does a great job capturing the atmosphere of claustrophobia and terror, but the humor falls almost completly flat. At first, I wondered why that is, I thought the funny dialogues were already in the book. But now I think the rythm of the dialogues can't be reproduced on film. Much of the humor depends on ""catch"" phrases beeing repeated verbatim, but changing their meaning everytime. Sometimes the same phrases are repeated right back several times in one conversation.

> A reader needs less time each repetition to read the words of the text; he already knows the sentence. He has more time to ponder the changing of tone or meaning. This makes the reading of the dialogues fast and funny. But when said aloud, each repetition takes the same time as before. As the Mike Nichols movie shows, this makes the dialogues extremely slow. The humour loses its rythm, that is to say, the humour is lost. The Nichols movie tried to compensate this by a frantic, overwinded delivery. Needless to say, it doesn't work. So an adaption would have to change what is imo the most important stylistic device of the book to have a chance at being funny.

I still think this is true, but I'm looking forward to be proven wrong.",gromolko,2015-09-22T20:53:45Z,Catch-22,COMMENT,2
