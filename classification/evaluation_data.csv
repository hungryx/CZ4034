If you like Dracula you need to read The Dracula Tapes. BS Dracula written from the POV of Vlad Tepes himself. It's pretty entertaining. He spends a lot.of.the book shit talking Van Helsing.,1.0
"A Dracula thread in 2022 and no one has mentioned the fantastic [Dracula Daily](https://draculadaily.substack.com/about) project yet? I'm shocked!

Dracula is written in letters and diary entries. They're dated. So someone took them all and has turned them into an email newsletter that will send you that day's Dracula text, and it's a *hoot* to read it this way with this many other people at the same pace.

I honestly thought that's what this thread would be about, since it just started in May and it's gone somewhat viral. Tumblr (yes, it still exists) and to a lesser extent Twitter are awash in Dracula memes, since hundreds of thousands of people have signed up for it.",1.0
"*Dracula* was first published 26th May. Last Thursday was the 125th Anniversary of the book being published and English Heritage arranged for an event where people dressed up as vampires congregated at Whitby. Apparently, it was a record breaking gathering too.",0.0
"I love *Dracula,* and I'm not remotely interested in vampires.

I've since discovered that a lot of Redditors found it a slog, which is the opposite of my experience. I couldn't put it down.

But yes, Lucy's mother deserved her fate, may she rest in peace. In fairness though, Van Helsing was very cagey with his information.",1.0
"Vampires in general are foolish, not sure why *Dracula* is more so than modern stories.  

*Dracula* pulled together a lot of folk mythology about vampires. If it had not been written I don’t think we would still be reading books about vampires.",0.0
If you’re still craving some Dracula when you finish you should check out Powers of Darkness. It’s the Icelandic translation which is based on earlier drafts of the final novel. It’s all told through Harker’s diary and takes place almost totally in the castle. Very very cool read.,1.0
"Great book, and recently I've encountered a neat way to enjoy it.

https://draculadaily.substack.com/about

Since the novel has epistolary form, this project e-mails you the parts of the book in 'real time' - on the dates of the journal entries or letters in the book itself. It's a really nice way to enjoy the book in a new way and sort of live through it with the characters.",1.0
"I just finished Dracula for the first time. I thought the beginning was almost comical, with all the peasants crossing themselves and J.H. being like ""Hmm.. I wonder why they are saying ""Satan"" and ""That guys fucked"", no matter off to the castle in the middle of fucking nowhere. I laughed when Dracula was like ""sleep as late as you want bro, I won't be around until late afternoon anyway"".  

I think it's one of my top 5 favorite books now",1.0
There's a pretty entertaining series called the Dresden Files in which Dracula is a primer for killing one type of vampire and to raise awareness of their existence.,0.0
"My pet peeve about the book, or rather, all the other literature it inspired: sunlight mildly inconveniences Dracula. I may have some details wrong, it's been a while, but there are definitely scenes in the book where Dracula walks around and fights in daytime.  He can't shapeshift during daytime, and he needs to rest for various reasons and once he's resting, he can only become active at sunset. 

But that's it! Bursting into flame in sunlight or any other major problem with it was invented by Hollywood, and has somehow become the second biggest part of vampire lore there is, after needing blood. Even works that pretend to be ""getting back to the basics"" of vampires usually include some problem with sun. It's weird, and makes some vampires so weak it's almost hard to take them seriously.",0.0
I just got caught up with Dracula Daily. I’ve never read Dracula before and this is a fun way approach it.,1.0
Bram Stoker's Dracula is *so* popular on Tumblr right now. So many memes from the book.,1.0
"the scene where dracula crawls headfirst down the fucking wall always gives me shivers, what a good book",1.0
"I'm reading it online right now, but as it happens. There is website that sends out an email whenever a character writes something. It's a really cool way to read the book, but only in peices. So it's super easy to digest.

I recommend checking it out. Cheers!",1.0
"Right now you can subscribe to Dracula Daily, which serializes the saga IN REAL TIME",1.0
"Worth reading Paul Barber's *Vampires, Burial and Death* for the folkloric and medical background.  They were quite a bit more widespread than Romania.

Stoker's book would be obscure if it weren't for the movies.  I go to Whitby a lot, where the Dracula tourism industry is huge.  But I got hold of a guidebook from 1926 - no mention of anything related AT ALL.  The whole phenomenon came from Hollywood.

My wife once took over as a cook at a residential school where the previous cook was an Eastern European who'd had to lesve abruptly.  She'd gone bananas and had blown a huge proportion of the catering budget buying ropes of garlic to festoon all the doorways as protection from vampires.  I'm pretty sure that was traditional folklore and didn't come from the book or a movie.",1.0
"Also check out the Dracula Tapes, if you want a twist where he’s the good guy trying to save innocent women from Van Helsing.",1.0
"The Audible version of Dracula is amazing too! They got different VAs to voice all the different narrators in the book, and I love all the VAs’ interpretations of the characters. Also, Tim Curry as Van Helsing!",1.0
"Will share this, it's a newsletter that sends the diary entries on the dates they are made in the books, pretty fun!

"Hey, I'm also reading Dracula! First book I've read all the way through since high school (I'm 29). I've got like 50 pages left. It's been so good! Definitely plan on picking up the books I've half read in the last few years.",1.0
"Now after reading that book, follow it with Fred Saberhagen's ""The Dracula Tapes"" which is a retelling of the story from Dracula's POV. It makes for an interesting contrast and an enjoyable follow up. Saberhagen has several other books in that series worth reading.",1.0
"You should totally check out Dracula's Child by J.S. Barnes!  

Like who has the fucking audacity to write a sequel to a classic novel? Somehow they absolutely nailed the tone of the original and while I would argue it has some pacing issues, so did the original so I guess it checks out lol.",1.0

"I got a story about reading Dracula for the first time. Back in high school, our school's library got a copy. It was sitting on the clerk's table, probably waiting to be ""processed"" (ie be logged into inventory and have that sleeve put in to hold the library card on the back.) I was waiting for it to finally hit the shelf. The problem was, it didn't. It sat on the clerk's table for close to year. At that point, I was a senior, I think it was that time when we basically didn't go to classes anymore so we basically just hung out at the lib in between graduation practice. The clerks were out for lunch, I see the book on the back of their table. I swiped it, put it in my bag, and went home and read it. I still have it to this day and it's one of my favorite possessions. I told my mom this story a couple months ago and she told me to return it.",1.0
"Read it last year, it was great novel! One thing I specially enjoyed was Dracula's character! >!He wasn't some mindless monster, nor some nice gentleman, but a spiteful, prideful and childish creature, on whom his characteristics from when he was alive reflected in his death. Characters had to study his life and work in order to predict his next moves. That kind of good writing is something that most of zillion movie/TV adaptations desperately lacked. No wonder Christopher Lee wanted to play him like in book, but he never got to star in proper adaptation.!<",1.0
"I've heard that Dracula pulled from an older story called Vampyre, which was written during the same time frame as Frankenstein, with the vampire being heavily based on Lord Byron.

Might be worth checking out.",1.0
"Dracula is a lot about... Being organised and analytical.

Knowledge is power and Mina is the link. She compiles all of the data, journals, print outs, into a package, which she then copies and shares with the group.

Why is why there is so much lore.

They are exploring and experimenting with everything.

Oh.. And they are unreliable narrators. Just because someone says Dracula can turn into must it doesnt mean he can.

Ultimately, what truly weakens Dracula is destroying the places he sleeps and he needs to urgently retreat back to Romania.",1.0
If you like Dracula give Carmilla a read. It was one of Bram’s influences. It’s about a lesbian Vampire. There’s a lot of similarities in how the vampire “rules” work. For instance in both books Vampires don’t die from daylight. I loved it.,1.0
I recommend reading Salem’s Lot by Stephen King after Dracula! I got that advice while finishing Dracula for the first time and loved how they complimented each other,1.0
"Dracula is funny in that it can feel so clichéd now because of the vampire tropes that it actually invented!

And I totally agree about the mum.",1.0
"I read Dracula for the first time last year, and I thought it was flipping great!",1.0
"Email daily Dracula started up again in May, they email you as the events occur from May till November

"Dracula is one of my earliest memories of reading a novel that didn't include the secret seven,the famous five or Nancy Drew!
This ""fascination"" with vampires led me to reading a lot more vampire related books like the saga of Darren Shan, twilight (obviously), the vampire diaries etc",1.0
"Dracula is a spectacular novel. And pretty darn scary. That scene where he goes out the window, then down the wall vertically. When the ship crashes into the port unmanned. Understated creepy. Plus, Van Helsing is a hero I can get behind. I know mistakes are made, but he is nothing if not committed. And a moral hero, not many of those anymore.",1.0
Dracula is one of those eternity books to me - I've started it SO many times for like 15 years now and the longest I've gotten so far is like middle. One day....,1.0
"Yeah ""Dracula"" really holds up, in my opinion. Feels a lot more modern than one might think when thinking of a ""classic.""",1.0
"Dracula is probably one of my favourite books, it's very slow but so atmospheric and I love the epistolary format, works really well. I'd also recommend ""Dracul"" by Dacre Stoker and J.D. Barker. It's a prequel to Dracula and it's amazing.",1.0
"Another really good one is [_The Historian_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Historian?wprov=sfla1) by Elizabeth Kostova. It's written in the same epistolic style as Dracula (letters, journal entries, etc.) and is sort of a sequel set 100+ years later.",1.0
Check out Dracula Daily. Dracula is a series of letters. With Dracula daily you get an email on the same date the letters were written. Experience the book as it happens between may and October.,1.0
I read Paradise Lost before Frankenstein and I was curious why Paradise Lost was one of the books he finds near the fire. It turns out Mary Shelly’s husband wrote a famous essay where he argued that Lucifer was the tragic hero of the story. I think this a cool little hit of meta literature that makes the book itself more interesting and alive.,1.0
"Oh god yes, Shelly's Frankenstein is a masterpiece. The prose is beautiful, the characters are so painfully human and the tragedy is heartbreaking. 

As well as being classic horror, it's also arguably the first piece of actual science fiction. Absolutely gorgeous work.",1.0
"Frankenstein and Dracula blew my mind. Been tracking down a lot of old gothic lit since.

None have been as good but still some pretty good stories.",1.0
Would you suggest any of those other ones for someone who also really enjoyed Frankenstein?,0.0
Dr. Frankenstein is so whiny.,0.0
"Well, monster WAS more human than Frankenstein but his rhetoric that he was hurt and wasn’t it just terrible that he had to kill innocents didn’t really do it for me.  Now, the Frankenstein was a complete and utter failure as a human, so there is that.  

But I am really interested to read different opinions about it here!",0.0
"I know everyone says that the doctor's name is Frankenstein and the monster is called ""Frankenstein's Monster"" but I think that the real Frankenstein is the monster we made along the way.",0.0
You should watch Penny Dreadful.  Best depiction of Frankenstein I’ve seen.,1.0
"The Dreamscape Media audiobook for Frankenstein is really good, highly recommend",1.0
"I read Frankenstein as part of a literature class in college a million years ago. Just reading without background, it's good. However, reading with literary/historical/philosophical perspective makes it a deeper, more compelling read.",1.0
I’m reading Frankenstein for the first time right now as well (just getting back into reading) and I love it.,1.0
I fucking love Frankenstein!!,1.0
"I don’t even like horror or science fiction but this is exactly how I felt when I read Frankenstein for the first time. Absolutely mind blowing, heart breaking and gut wrenching.",1.0
"Fun fact: She wrote this inspired by the first experiments years beforehand by Luigi and Lucia Galvani that proved bioelectricity. Galvani’s nephew Giovanni Aldini did public demonstrations with animals and a human corpse. People were astonished that they could be made to twitch and move with zaps of current. People started to wonder whether electricity was the stuff of life. So it seemed like not to much if an intuitive leap that if we could just pipe in enough juice, we could re-animate a corpse.

Frankenstein really was the first science fiction novel.",1.0
Watch the Hammer Horror treatment of Frankenstein. It’s the most true to the book in terms of being sympathetic to the creature and casting Victor as the true villain.,1.0
"You can call the monster Frankenstein. It’s okay, it’s canon. 

You can also at the same time you’re doing that understand primogeniture, women’s rights at the time, Mary Shelly’s personal journey as a woman author, and all the other themes of the book, all the while calling the monster Frankenstein. It’s okay. Don’t listen to the eggheads, follow your heart.",0.0
Frankenstein is a metaphor for woman in her book. It’s a brilliant piece of SciFi-Feminism,1.0
"I read this a while ago. I agree with the director of victor Frankenstein that it was boring. But good for you, that you enjoyed it.",0.0
"Have you ever watched Penny Dreadful? Dr. Frankenstein is a main character and the implication is Shelley then wrote his story but presented it as fiction. It’s a wonderful show, and I love the Creature so much. Quite sympathetic over time, and so tragic.",1.0
"It’s one of my favourite books. I rarely read a book more than once but I’ve read it so many times. 
Though I really enjoy the film adaptations out there (especially Bride of Frankenstein), none really capture the essence of the book. The idea of the creature being a creation rather than some body parts cobbled together. 

There’s a pretty good comic adaptation by Junji Ito that’s worth checking out.",1.0
I also suggest reading Dean Koontz's Frankenstein series! It’s a unique take on this tale set in modern time.,0.0
"I remember reading Frankenstein for my AP Literature class and it was one my favorites I read all year. Has all the elements I like to find in a book (well written, interesting/unique plot, has multiple messages throughout the story). It opened my mind up to reading other classics which I now understand why they’re deemed classic. Glad you also enjoy the story!",1.0
"Lemme guess: Dr. Frankenstein is the real monster?        /s
I do want to read that book someday.",1.0
"The grotesque tragedies that keep snowballing in the wake of his creation, and that Frankenstein is helpless to stop, is truly horrifying.",1.0
"I agree fully. I read many of the old horror classics, and Frankenstein was by far my favorite. Going in, not having seen any movie based on the book,  I thought it would be a simple monster story about a crazy scientist creating a huge, dumb brute for evil purposes.",1.0
"IF you liked Frankenstein, you might like the fictional novel My Imaginary Mary that trails the life of Mary Shelley. Like I said, very fictionalized but I loved it and it gave me some good background on her, her parents, Lord Byron, and Percy Shelley.",1.0
"Frankenstein is my favorite book of all time. I didn’t  fully appreciate it until I read it as an adult, but it’s simply a masterpiece. The characters, themes, imagery, plot. Everything is perfect from start to finish.",1.0
Frankenstein was great! Same with Dracula. Its crazy to see what they have turned into in more moden times. Especially Frankenstein..,1.0
I had to read Frankenstein for my English literature degree this year and I as well regret not reading it sooner.,1.0

"Hi. It is as if nothing new is being said. But, this is actually a great post.

I haven’t read it, Frankenstein, but I think I know why it could be among the greatest and more important stories of our time.

Congratulations and best wishes to all those fortunates who have dive into this book.

Thank you for bringing this title to our attention.

Have a good day.

Thanks.",1.0
"I was impressed with his sequel to The Shining (Doctor Sleep). Danny as a grown-up who manages to use his ability to help others, in spite of his own trauma. Then fighting the energy vampires. Plus some closure for him in there too. Well worth the read coming off the first book.

I'd watch the two movies only after reading both books first. They're good, too, but both do play out a little different from the books",1.0
"What I always liked about *The Shining* in contrast to many of his other novels is how controlled it is. It's very tightly focused and intense. He takes just a couple of characters--and really only one primary character--and isolates them far away from everybody and everything. It's an extremely introspective and ruminative novel which sets it apart from many of his others which suffer from what I always think of as the 'cast of thousands' issue. Some of his other novels seem to depend upon a big, big supporting cast of folks to prop up the main story and there's a certain sameness which obtains after a bit. *The Shining* is really just Jack and his demons and that makes it feel very tightly wound up, and I like that.

As far as the Kubrick adaptation is concerned it is common knowledge that King did not care for it very much and he made his displeasure very clear. But the thing about it is that it is not a Stephen King adaptation as much as it is a Stanley Kubrick film, and Kubrick gives his own interpretation of King's novel which is a re-imagining of King's novel and most certainly not any kind of a mirror image.",1.0
"My advice for watching Kubrick’s *The Shining* for the first time:

- Watch it on the biggest screen possible with a good sound system.

- Accept that it has almost nothing to do with King’s book.

Seriously, besides character names and some basic plot points, the two are completely separate products. King hated Kubrick’s adaptation, which is understandable because the film deviated in almost every way from the book, including character developments and major themes.

That said, the movie is an absolute masterpiece, visually groundbreaking and disturbing and layered. Kubrick was a literal genius (IQ of 200) and operating on a singular creative level. The most famous scenes of the movie are not even in the book. There is a whole subculture of people who do nothing but analyze the movie and come up with thematic conspiracies based on little hints and easter eggs. It’s a trip.

Both book and movie are great for different reasons. If you treat them like separate, unique experiences, you’ll appreciate both for their respective strengths.",1.0
"The Shining was also my first Stephen King book about 30 years ago. About the same time, I was having an issue with a large cyst at the base of my spine and in the weeks leading up to my surgery I had to soak in a tub several times a week for an hour. I can say there were times while soaking and reading the book I was absolutely terrified. I had never had that feeling from a book before in my life. I have not read a ton of King since then, but his ability to do that with words alone has stayed with me all these years.",1.0
"I recently read The Shining after having watched the movie many times throughout my life. I still like the movie, but I understand why so many prefer the book. Doctor Sleep (the sequel) is really good too. 

As far as other Stephen King, I highly recommend The Dark Tower series. The Talisman and The Black House have the same protagonist and tie in with The Dark Tower.",1.0
"I am not a huge Stephen King fan but loved The Shining. It is one of the few books that really creeped me out, and did so without me realizing it right away. Like, I put the book down after reading for a while and realized a significant sense of dread that lasted over the next hour or two. Fun times when I was reading during a lunch break at work or the like. :)",1.0
I read this book after watching the shining for the first time about 3 years ago. I have been hooked on Stephen King since. I have read about 25 of his books now and am always looking for more!,1.0
"I went down the same Stephen King rabbit hole a few years ago by picking up the Shining. I ended up reading over 30 Stephen King books, including the entire Dark Tower series. It was a fantastic ride. 

I would suggest the Stand or Salems lot next!",1.0
The ending of The Shining always makes me cry a lil.,1.0
"The Shining is so good because it's perfect in suspense. We don't see all these paranormal things at the beggining, Stephen King introduce them to us slowly, though a whole book. After every paranormal thing there are some pages without it, so it's scary for the whole time

Love it.",1.0
"Early King is best King. Newer King is good too, but The Shining may be my favorite of his for exactly the reasons you mentioned. The characters, the ambience, the stream of consciousness written so brilliantly creepy.",1.0
"The Shining was my first Stephen King book 20 years ago. I'd always liked Goosebumps and such, but I hadn't been allowed to read real/grown up horror stories. My mom told me I could read some Stephen King books if I finished my summer reading list for school. The Shining is still my favorite book. I love all the stories about all the different ghosts.

EDIT: The Kubrik movie changed a lot of the stuff I liked from the book. I prefer the two part/miniseries version.",1.0
"I don't enjoy violence and horror at all, but the Shining is one I do like. (It's probably because it's not disgusting just creepy.) I thrifted a vhs of The Shining that I want to watch tonight, so I was happy to see this post. I've never experienced The Shining on vhs before.",1.0
"The Shining is one of those books that makes me dislike movie adaptations in general, and I entirely blame Stanley Kubrick for that.

Because the book is indeed phenomenal, and the movie is one of the most overrated movies ever made. The Shining itself is entirely irrelevant to the plot of the movie, Danny is mostly superfluous to his own story, the supernatural elements are scary for the sake of scary with no narrative explanation, and Halloran is a red herring used to deceive the audience into thinking he matters.

I haven’t seen the movie for Doctor Sleep, mostly because I enjoyed the book and don’t want it to be ruined for me like The Shining almost did.",1.0
"If you like the Shining, you should definitely read The Stand.",1.0
The Shining miniseries starring Steven Weber and Rebecca DeMornay was far better than the theatrical movie. Watched it again a few years ago and it holds up.,1.0
"I have yet to read the shining but I do like the movie although I’ve heard it’s very different from the book. Stephen King hates it and said that Kubrick cut out the monotony and repetition of day to day tasks that helped drive the main character made.

Also in regards you liking Stephen King. I usually love reading his stories. I just enjoy is writing style. Even the stories he wrote that I didn’t particularly like I still enjoyed reading them.",1.0
"I’ve only read If It Bleeds, Pet Sematary, and The Shining. I loved them all so much. Seriously- make Pet Sematary your next SK read!!! It’s incredible (better than The Shining in my opinion).",1.0
"The Shining is one of my all time favorite books. If you want other King recommendations, I strongly recommend Pet Semetery and Green Mile. The book Pet Semetery also has much more depth than the movie (didn’t see the re-make, heard it’s awful). It made me pretty emotional, the way it depicts the unhealthy ways a family handles grief and trauma, while being manipulated by a great supernatural force. Green Mile is not horror (if you know about the movie you already know that) but also deals with supernatural phenomena, as well as racism and bias in a flawed justice system. Loved it.",1.0
"Interesting. The shining was my first title i read this year, back in January. I was extremely underwhelmed. However, that might have been because i knew the plot from watching the movie",1.0

Read Doctor Sleep next! It follows The Shining,1.0
"A lot of people will say go read “The Stand,” or “Doctor Sleep,” but personally I’d say go straight into Pet Semetary. There’s something special and down right terryfing about that book. And if you liked the characterization and dramatic build up in the Shining Pet Semtary’s will also make you hold your breath, and feel a cold chill.",1.0
"The Shining was my first too. If you’re looking for the next King book to read I’d read either one of his earlier, shorter books (Salem’s Lot, Pet Sematary, Carrie) or go with one of his best newer ones (IMO) Revival",1.0
"I've read a lot of Stephen King. The Shining is the only book I've ever stopped reading after general creepiness, might terrors, etc.

I straight up woke up one night with my whole room seemingly pulsing in time with my heart, and the bathtub lady standing at the foot of my bed.",1.0
"Dr. Sleep, the sequel to the shining, is really good too! I just finished both.",1.0
"I read this for the first time in the last 70's (when it first came out) and I was in junior high.  It so enjoyably scared the ever loving crap out of me.  I couldn't put it down... as long as I could find a quiet room to read which had at least one other person in it.

The song ""I'm Not In Love"" by 10cc was just becoming popular and I was reading the parts about snow covered topiary.  That ethereal start to ""I'm Not In Love"" will always remind of a cold as hell, snowy wind, blowing across supernatural malevolent hedges bent on Holloran's destruction.

This was my first ""adult"" book and I did get sideways glances from some of my teachers as I read in class.  I'll never forget those days and how intertwined they were with my reading of the Shining.",1.0
Just read Misery and had the same feeling of being uneasy the entire time. Love the movie but the book is even better. Think I might go for The Shining next...,1.0
"I've only read Pet Sematary by Stephen King and am reading The Stand right now. Pet Sematary was such a great read and the audiobook read by Michael C. Hall is PHENOMENAL! But Pet Sematary is also a great, creepy read but it really explores grief and the process of it and how it can consume us and lead us down a path that could ultimately lead to insanity if we let it. It's an amazing book so I'm pretty excited about diving in to other books like The Shining, eventually.",1.0
The Shining is my read once a year book. Jack so sad. When he looking for key in the shed. I felt hope. He felt hope. Then he chucked it. I died inside. He died inside.,1.0
"After reading Pet Sematary and Misery, I read the Shining. I felt like The Shining was a LOT more mild and contained less profundity. I think Pet Sematary is the best book I’ve ever read, it was very powerful and really got under my skin and in my head. Misery was a very fast-paced book and was so interesting and suspenseful. The Shining, for me, had less of an impact",1.0
"I though the book and the movie were both great !

I just saw Doctor Sleep this week and I liked it, has anyone read the book ? If so, would you recommend it ? Is it as strong as the shining?",1.0
"I had heard mixed things about Doctor Sleep, but I ended up really liking it. It's an open-hearted look at addiction and recovery. At first I didn't see a need for a sequel to The Shining, but Doctor Sleep more than justified it's existence.",1.0
"I borderline liked the Doctor Sleep book more than The Shining, I enjoyed the character relationships much more in it. Tried to watch the movies recently as I only finished reading both books within the last two weeks, and couldn't even get half an hour in to either of them.",1.0
"I liked Doctor Sleep too because of how it answered so many questions and gave us closure for Danny but it just didn’t have the intensity of The Shining. I think it had the potential to be as good but didn’t quite get there.

ETA: I liked the movie but again, they had to simplify it to fit into one movie. That always sucks.",1.0
"Yeah. I said this above, but the last time I watched The Shining it struck me that it's a horror movie about domestic abuse. 

It's a lot less fun to watch now.",1.0
"I was a serious King fan for years. I read everything by him, except that I've disliked anything written after about 2002 so read almost any. (So, read everything before 2002.)

The Shining is, by far, his best book. It is his least ""Stephen King"" book, but having taken a long hiatus from reading him, thats a good thing. His lengthy character development can get a bit tedious, and some of his early work is great for the abrupt, direct nature of its horror.

Edited for clarity.",1.0
"I’d like to suggest N0S4A2 as well, written by King’s son. I consider it as part of the Shining books.",1.0
The movie of Doctor Sleep is really good. It definitely differs from the book and fits more as a sequel to the Shining movie but it is very good.,1.0
"I recently saw the Doctor Sleep movie and they managed to remain pretty damn faithful to the book, with a few changes here and there to make it mesh with the film version. My biggest complaints are that they left out most of the Wendy flashbacks, and Abra's grandmother was omitted entirely, which fucking sucked. That said, they did so for a reason, because the climax had to be much different due to the change from the books of the hotel still existing rather than being blown up. What they do with that is actually narratively interesting, and circles back around to give us a meta callback to the ending of the original Shining book, which I found very satisfying. If you dislike the difference between the Shining book and movie, Doctor Sleep the movie actually goes a long way to correcting some of those wrongs and ""fixing"" it a little bit.

Other than the climax and the omission of the grandmother though? The film is almost scene for scene from the book. It's worth a watch, *especially* if you didn't care for the changes in the original film.",1.0
Why do people say jack is a jackass at the beginning of the shining movie? He doesn’t start to lose his temper until the snow comes which is the same way in the book.,1.0
"It’s funny because I always heard how terrible King is at writing women. Having grown up watching The Shining, I was like sure, he must be because she is useless. Then one day I decided to read it (first King book) and I was blown away by Wendy in the book. She’s intelligent, caring, and brave, fighting tooth and nail for her family. To this day, I can’t bring myself to rewatch the film.",1.0

"Maybe so, but the movie features only four characters, and as a character study, it’s just awful.

Danny is a stereotypical young boy, with only stereotypical young boy interests, and no actual personality. The book had the sub plot of his imaginary friend that turned out to be named after Danny’s middle name and was an extension of his own psyche dealing with trauma, all of which is internal conflict, and all of which was absent from the movie.

Danny’s mother (whose name I can’t even recall without looking her up) is a shrill, annoying, horse faced woman that contributes literally nothing towards the movie other than victim hood, completely missing the effects that she had towards her husband and son in the book.

Halloran is a caricature of a black man, introducing concepts to the audience that are never expanded upon, and he dies the moment he tries to be anything more to the story than expository lore. In the book, Halloran took on the role of mentor and was extremely useful towards keeping Danny alive against the forces of evil. In the movie, he was entirely worthless towards any of the other characters or the overarching plot.

The worst, however, is Jack. Jack Torrence in the book is a tragic figure. A man torn between a temper he cannot control, an addiction he cannot overcome, and resentment he has yet to actually address. As a character in the book, Jack Torrence is a message to the reader, a sort of “there but for the grace of god go I”. At the end of the story, because of the temptations of the Overlook and it’s malevolent spirit entity, Jack succumbs to his own inner demons and is cast out of his own body, being used as a puppet to slay his own family. Jack in the book was dead long before the Overlook blew up, and throughout the story that ending was alluded to in references to the faulty boiler. In the movie, Jack goes insane for no real explored reason. He’s just an asshole and a psychopath that decides to torment and terrify because he’s **bored**! His death at the end of the story was pointless, as was his murder of Halloran. In the end, nothing was gained, just a spooky ghost story whose elements never add up to anything more than Cabin Fever hallucinations.

It’s not just that the themes are opposite. The movie is inconsistent in its plot, one dimensional with its characters, and shallow in its morals. It was visually striking, and the sound and set designs were excellent, and that’s about as much positive things I have to say about it.

Like I said before, Stanley Kubrick was a brilliant artist. Several of the scenes from The Shining, like several scenes from most of his movies, in particular 2001: A Space Odyssey, are art in motion. But the script is bad, the acting is sub par, and the story is disappointing. Kubrick may have been a great artist, but he was a shitty storyteller.",0.0
"That’s just my point, though. If The Shining is one of the best examples of a horror movie that is good, that’s a scathing indictment of all the other horror movies, because it is not, objectively, a good movie. It is poorly constructed, poorly written, and poorly acted.

As far as I can tell, the sole reason why The Shining is hailed as a masterpiece of horror movies is because of the (admittedly) fantastic cinematography. That’s it.",0.0
"Honestly, I so dislike King's shift in writing style that I purposely didn't read Dr Sleep because I didn't want it to ruin The Shining.",0.0
"I get that. I'd seen the movie many times and always enjoyed it, but when I picked up the book it was an entirely different experience and I understand exactly why it gets flack for the vast departure. That said, I've learned over the years to appreciate adaptations for what they are and enjoy them as different interpretations of source material, and judge them on their own merits. Game of Thrones departed greatly from source material and was still very good, until it went down the shitter, while The Mist took a King novella and turned it into something even better than the original. In the case of The Shining, yeah, the movie only resembles the book in the broadest of strokes, but I can still appreciate it as an alternate take on the story, albeit the inferior one.

Doctor Sleep feels like a double-duty continuation and band-aid for the original film. It sticks to it's own source material *very* closely, while also throwing in some callbacks to the film version that it's acting as a continuation to, and in adapting to accommodate the changes in the original film, it manages to repair some of the damage, so far as it can. What we missed out on in the climax of the original film we get a taste of in Doctor Sleep's, and those that were fans of the book will greatly appreciate how they cap things off, even if it changes the ending drastically. I still prefer the book, but Doctor Sleep the movie just comes across as a sort of apology to fans of the books for all that they got cheated out of, and for that I genuinely loved it.",1.0
"Except that I am not. I am judging the movie by the standards of a movie. As far as cinematic structure is concerned, The Shining is a terrible movie. It introduces plot elements that are later forgotten or abandoned, it introduces characters that end up not mattering in the way they are set up, it brings up interesting concepts such as the existence of the supernatural and then fails to expound upon them or explore them, and it features characters without any discernible character arc or motivations beyond the surface level.

I am **not** criticizing the movie The Shining for being a bad book. I am criticizing it for being a bad movie.",0.0
"You misunderstand the nature of my criticism of the Shining as a movie. I am not criticizing it because of its differences from the book. In fact, I saw the movie before I read the book, and hated it from the first viewing.

The movie is bad on its own merits, which is why it’s popularity has always been baffling to me. It’s poorly written, featuring red herrings, audience based misdirection, and useless additions. It adds elements it does not explain nor fit together, and has a payoff that is unsatisfying in its pointlessness. It follows four characters, three of whom are portrayed by untalented actors, and the fourth of whom is clearly having the time of his life playing an unrepentant, irredeemable jackass that acts like a cartoonish villain in the third act for reasons that are insufficiently explored.

From a narrative perspective, The Shining is simply a bad movie. It’s great from an atmospheric perspective, but a good atmosphere does not a good movie make.

That the book is so good makes me hate the movie more, but even just judged as a stand-alone movie it isn’t good.",0.0
"In fairness, The Shining is infamous for the fact that Stanley Kubrick outright tortured Shelley Duvall during it's production. He made her do dozens and dozens of takes back to back while screaming at her and not allowing her to rest or take a break. He had a vision of Wendy that was very different from the book version and pushed to ensure it got captured on film. Shelley Duvall herself was a very accomplished and capable actress, so any appearance of her being annoying isn't due to Duvall herself, but rather what Kubrick wanted to portray.

Regardless, even if she was retooled specifically to be annoying in the film version compared to her quiet yet determined nature in the book, that only reinforces the fact that Kubrick pushed for Jack to basically hate his family from the jump, rather than being a good guy with a dark past who is making a monumental effort to be better because he loves them so much. Movie Jack shows no such inclination, and one could easily imagine that in a different set of circumstances, he might have finished his book, got published and instantly dumped Wendy and Danny on a curb somewhere to go do a few lines off of hookers ass because he cared so little for them.",0.0
"I also fully agree the movie was way deeper than the book. Stephen king wrote a story about a haunted hotel. Kubrick was not trying to directly adapt the Shining, but rather use it as a vehicle to explore themes of generational trauma, the atrocities committed by humanity over the decades, genocide and familial abuse. I'm not saying that the book didn't explore those things as well, but it was much less abstract and thought provoking than Kubrick's movie because it wasn't exploring the human condition the way Kubrick was. I feel like you're looking at the movie through the lens of the book and trying to make sense of the movie through that book which I believe is the wrong way of looking at it. Kubrick had no intention of directly adapting the novel and included several specific details to show the audience that that is what he was doing. I think you have to look at the movie and book as two completely different entities that can be valued separately for different reasons. Personally the movie is one of my favorites of all time because of how incredibly well Kubrick uses elements of the book stripped of their original intent to create not only a new story, but as well create allegories and explore themes of historical atrocities that continue over time, way beyond the surface level events of just what happened at the overlook. I think what you are mistaking as shallowness is just trying to view the movie through the lens of the book which is just never going to work. The movie is actually like, super notorious for the amount of deeper meaning that was layered into it and as far as what I understand the book does not inspire even close to the same kind of analysis that the movie does. The book attempted to be more of a character study, the movie never attempted to be that even for a second because that's not the story Kubrick was trying to tell.",1.0
"I don't really want to get into an argument about the Shining because while it's one of my favorite movies, I don't have it on top of my head and it has been a few years since I've seen it.

 Appeals to popularity don't invalidate the argument. You saying that the Shining is objectively bad is counteracted by people who study the movie and say it's objectively good. Perhaps different people look at different things and attribute different value to the same thing. Maybe what you think makes a movie bad is something I do not care about and what you think makes a book good is something that I don't care about. 

Despite not knowing the movie by heart, I'll try to address your points.

The Shining being irrelevant to the movie? Don't think this matters at all, it adds to the mysticism of the universe and lends strength to the supernatural elements of the movie.

 
Danny being superfluous to the story? Couldn't care less, he's a small child dealing with things he doesn't understand and has little control over.

The supernatural elements are scary for the sake of scary? Do not agree at all. When Wendy sees the dog giving a blowjob to the waiter, that is not being scary for the sake of being scary. Narrative explanation doesn't have to be explicit to exist and also does not need to exist at all.

Halloran being a red herring is another thing I don't think matters. It emphasizes the point that it's Wendy and Danny alone that must deal with the monster that is pursuing them.


Have you seen The Shining mini-series directed by Stephen King? Do you think it was better than the movie? The movie being much more open ended and leaving things to be explained make for much more memorable and valuable media, in my opinion.",1.0
"Well you are wrong and that’s okay. Movies don’t have to explain everything, expound on every concept in fact the best movies are rarely the ones that don’t make me think. When the shining credits roll theirs lots of questions and that’s what makes it so compelling.",1.0
"They did a mixture of both, but the hotel sequence in Doctor Sleep is a sequel to the Kubrick movie. The Shining book didn’t have a hedge maze and the hotel blew up at the end.",0.0
"I’m really confused by this argument. You’re like the fifth person to argue that I’m looking at the movie from the perspective of the book. I can assure you, I am not.

Firstly, I saw the movie before reading the book, and I hated it from the first viewing because the cinematic narrative flaws were apparent to me even then.

The Shining itself is entirely irrelevant to the plot of the movie, nor are the ghosts and various supernatural apparitions ever tied to hallucinations or otherwise made to be an exploration of the human condition. That’s why this argument doesn’t hold up. The movie was loaded with scary things there for the sake of being scary, and that detracts from any potential message about the exploration of generational trauma.

This reeks of post hoc rationalization, where rather than judging the content by its own merits, you are judging the content based on the messages **you** have applied to it.

That’s about as far from objective as you can get. I am criticizing the movie for as close to objective reasons as I can manage.

For example, the character of Halloran is, cinematically, a red herring. He is introduced to the audience as another person with the special quality as Danny. Never in the movie is the nature of the Shining explored, it is intentionally kept vague. Through The Shining, Danny is able to receive visions, though these visions fail to change anything about the sequence of events, nor do they explore Danny or his father as individuals. Narratively, they are white noise. Danny is then able to use The Shining to call for help from Halloran in the third act. Halloran comes to the call, demonstrating that there is some truth to the usefulness of the phenomenon. Only this is untrue, as Halloran gets slaughtered ten seconds after entering the hotel. Had the scenes with Danny calling and Halloran answering been cut from the movie, the plot would have been unchanged. That Danny and his mother stole the dead man’s snow speeder to escape is almost irrelevant given that happened in the last seconds of the film and their escape was still ambiguous (prior to the release of Doctor Sleep, anyway).

Cinematically, the movie is poorly constructed. The ideas are muddled and the themes unclear. The idea you can honestly argue that the movie wasn’t about a haunted hotel given the presence of literal ghosts is a little silly. Kubrick just didn’t commit to the supernatural elements and used them purely for atmosphere. Which is bad filmmaking.",0.0
"I mean, I loved the ending of the novel immensely with Danny unleashing the ghosts on everyone and siccing Abra's grandmother in particular on Rose. That was powerful. The Hotel needn't be involved for it to be impactful that Danny finds some measure of closure for his personal (and very real) demons while also paving a path forward to a better life for himself at the place where all of those demons were born.

That said, I give full marks to the film for taking the original ending of The Shining and recasting Danny as the tragic figure who is subsumed by the evil of the Overlook and forced to chase down someone he loves and wants desperately not to hurt before the place goes up in a boiler explosion, exactly like it did in the original. It's a much darker ending, and I'm perfectly okay with that, but both have some great merit on their own. The movie gives it a darker bent, as well as adapting one of the best parts of the original book that got gutted in terms of impact in the original film, while the book tells a tale of a man who's had a rough go of life from the very beginning returning to the place where all his troubles began and *literally* vanquishing his demons so he can move towards a brighter tomorrow. The film version rights a wrong from the original adaptation and delivers some feelings and concepts that should have been in the original, while the book provides a triumphant showdown against evil.

I enjoy both, though for different reasons, and I quite enjoy having two different takes on the same story. I still think one is better than the other, but that doesn't make either of them ""bad"", just different.",1.0
"I’ve admitted on multiple occasions myself that the cinematography and set/sound design for the movie are incredible. I’m not denying that. The entire draw point of the movie over the book is the phenomenal atmosphere Kubrick managers to cultivate.

But it’s poorly written and constructed. That you appeal to how the movie made you feel rather than how it was put together, as well as the fact that you characterize the book’s ending as poor, honestly just tells me you don’t have any appreciation for narrative structure.

And that’s totally fine.

But the problem is when you’re arguing against objective evaluation with an attitude of not caring about objective evaluation. If you don’t care about the things a movie does right and wrong, and you only care about how it makes you feel, then such discussions are entirely pointless. We’re just speaking past each other.

So I’m glad you enjoy the movie, but I insist that there is a meaningful difference between something being enjoyable, and something being well made.

Kubrick was a wonderful artist, and The Shining has several moments that are art in motion. But the story is awful, and the script is poor, and I honestly don’t understand perspectives like yours that choose to dismiss all of that.",0.0
"I can say the objective things that I care about. The technical details are as objective as it can get and you also agree that they're amazing. They cannot be dismissed, they are present in the entire movie and take up center stage in many of the movie's points. You mention the phenomenal atmosphere, and the phenomenal atmosphere was precisely what Kubrick was trying to create and what the majority of people resonate with. In the same way that you say I'm dismissing your objective criticisms, I can also say that you're dismissing the things that make the movie great.

Other things that are good.

Jack Nicolson is incredible. The feeling of isolation is incredible. The portrayal of domestic abuse is incredible. And honestly, seeing the majority of the movie from Jack's perspective makes it much more powerful as well. I do not see Danny as being the main character in the Shining, it is all about Jack. 

I can't speak of the script because, again, I don't have the book on the top of my head, but I find the movie's story to be way more compelling than the book's, I couldn't take it seriously. The changes to the story are a big improvement, in my eyes.



The things you say are badly made, for me, were not badly made at all, but even if they were, they are completely irrelevant to the quality of the movie. King's writing is very simplistic. Does it make his books horrible, for not being Nobel Prize material? I'd argue that it doesn't because it's not King's focus, his writing is good enough to convey what he wants to.",1.0
"I think you have to appreciate them as two separate entities. The Shining is my favorite King novel, but I also love the movie for what it is. The movie excels with giving you that feeling of dread, as well as the  very creepy atmosphere and of course the acting which make this film a classic. With that being said, I can see why King was upset with how it was adapted. I almost don’t even think of them as the same story.",1.0
Alternative take: Great movie adaptions are achieved with wise and confident changes. I'd rather watch the shining as is than any remotely safe 1:1 adaption. Its a wonderful reinvention that I personally find more compelling. There's also nothing generic about the shining.,1.0
"I just finished reading The Shining recently and watched the movie for the first time.
I did not know King disliked the movie but it makes perfect sense as I had the exact same issues. The Shining main character is flawed but clearly loves his family, especially his son. In the movie it never even hints that he loves Danny, the one scene he says how much he loves him is so tense and Danny's actor is clearly uncomfortable.

The movies honestly so different I feel its better as it's own thing. Reading the shining for the first time (and not having seen the movie except the iconic scenes) I kept expecting to see the elevator blood scene or the little girls calling to Danny and none of that exists in the book. The whole last 1/4 is all unique to the film, which personally helped me distance it even more in my head.",1.0
"This is how I felt when I read The Shining. It isn't my favorite King book, but I totally sympathize with him feeling like the movie erased all of Jack's merits and took away a lot of Wendy's agency. 

I think King hates it so much because of that, and that book is also very very personal to him. To see the characters and story portrayed as they were made audiences think that that was the story he had written, and it wasn't. I don't think that adaptations need to be symmetric to their source texts, and The Shining is an excellent piece of art in its own right. 

The main problem I have with the movie is that Stanley Kubrick is a bad person on a human level. The psychological abuse of the cast and crew, particularly Shelley Duvall, is what makes it hard for me to love that movie. I don't care how good his film making was, Kubrick was a major prick and I think that's another reason that King hated it so much. It was a dishonest portrayal of the characters he wrote (regardless of how good their reinvention was) and the environment of the production itself was hostile as hell. 

I totally understand your emotions (and King's) on this, but unfortunately I have to admit that the film was still an excellent piece of cinema. Fuck Kubrick though",0.0
"I'm know that I'm biased; the movie is one of my favorites. And -is- my favorite horror movie, hands down. So, grain of salt.

But i do think it's unfair to call Kubrick's The Shining a generic haunted house movie. The slow burn of the tension, the amazing practical effects, the feeling of being off-kilter for the whole film. Even the subtext, which may or may not have been included,  and what Kubrick may or may not have meant by it, is interesting. 

I do agree that the movie does not reflect the book well. But then, it's hard to translate such a book into a visual medium and not lose something. And we know this, because we have proof. In 1997, Stephen King  wrote and produced a TV mini series based on his own novel. He was involved in pretty much every aspect of the series, and so gave us his version of The Shining as a visual media product.

And it's dull. 

It's not awful. The character development is much better. The woman that plays Wendy is ages better than Shelley Duvall (who, in my opinion,  is the weakest part of Kubrick's version). But it remains drawn out and slightly boring.

And look at Dr. Sleep. It was a decent enough novel, but the movie, i thought, was messy and saccharine. 

Kubrick was notorious for cutting up source material to fit his own ends. Just look at the controversy surrounding A Clockwork Orange. But I don't think that diminishes the merits of his version of the Shining. I like to think his movie is a distillation of King's novel, and goes a long way to doing what King himself recommends when storytelling: show me, don't tell me.",1.0

"Plenty of films have strayed far from their source material, and authors have embraced it. Take Annihilation for example. Sounds like The Shining was a very personal work to King, so he just never took a liking to it being messed with.

Either way it's fascinating to see how filmmakers adapt and interpret other artists works.  In the case of The Shining, Kubrick created a masterpiece.  You may not like it, but it's considered an all time great for many many reasons - funny enough, the source material not really being one of them.",1.0
"I completely understand. I read The Shining for the first time when I was 13 and immediately fell in love. For years that was my number one favorite book, and to this day remains in my top five. So when I finally rented the VHS to witness the controversial masterpiece that is Kubrick's The Shining, I was mad! I could not accept the crude handling of Wendy as a shrieking helpless pixie. The maze wasn't interesting to me. And I didn't care about Jack's thousand yard stare. But I think that the Danny and ghost interactions where what upset me the most. To me they were bland and of little importance while in the book it was so much more. 

I didn't rewatch Kubrick's Shining for another 15 years, but I reread the book countless times. I am better able to appreciate Kubrick's work as a stand alone entity loosely influenced by King's book now as an adult. I can see the art that is that piece of cinema. I like its impact on pop culture overall, the twin girls is always a great meme, but no it isn't as good as the book when it comes to telling a frightening story of madness, ghosts, survival, and a strange little boy.",1.0

Same with Doctor Sleep.

Kubrick's movie is actually one of the best examples I can point to when I say that infidelity to the source material doesn't inherently make an adaptation bad, nor does fidelity to that material make an adaptation good. I like to use The Shining for this because there actually is another adaptation of it released in 1997 which is much more faithful and a whole lot worse than either of the prior works.",1.0
"I think your first sentence is way off the mark to begin with. Stephen King's movie adaptations have almost universally been critically acclaimed. Carrie, The Shining, Green Mile, fucking SHAWSHANK, Children of the Corn is a cult classic, Firestarter, The Mist has arguably one of the most unpredictable and gut-wrenching endings in all of cinema, Misery. I think it is a big stretch to say he has a ""long history of poor adaptations"". In fact, regarding film adaptations of famous books, I would say that King probably has the best record of any author whos books have adaptions at all.

That being said, yes, the Shining film does leave a lot of internal monologuing out of the narration. You don't quite get the same sympathy for Jack in the film as he appears in the book. I also think that Jack Nicholson's portrayal was a significant part of why Jack felt like a psychopath from the beginning. It's his acting style.",1.0

The film is full of mystery in a way the book is not.  

Perhaps the book resonates more with those who have struggled with addiction. But for me, it was a little too obvious and not my favorite of King's.  But I can definitely see why King would take issue with the adaptation. Kubrick obscures the addiction theme and instead focuses on madness and isolation.",1.0

I sincerely hope that Paolini has learned that often less is more. Eragon was an incredible story!

"I absolutely loved the Inheritance Cycle. That said, I can totally see that it wasn't for everyone. Internet culture tends to be very protective if their fandom and having Paolini himself respond to you (in a cool way) speaks more about his character than any book he's ever written.

He's about my age and I was always in awe that he could take on such a ask and write a coherent book.

I'm very intrigued with what this new story/saga. For me, Eragon and the others were great because you can totally follow along the story and not feel lost. It was engaging and entertaining. In fact, I should read it again sometime.

I hope the redditors haven't soured your interest in this author's books going forward.",1.0
"I mean, bits and pieces of the series were really good! Like the Seithr oil subplot from the beginning of book 1:

* Brom tells Eragon about the chemical used to torture Eragon's aunt and uncle before killing them. In its natural form, Seithr oil is used by jewlers to polish gems, but if enchanted with a blood sacrifice, it becomes an incredibly caustic poison sought after by assassins.

* Eragon gets the idea to track down his family's killers by sneaking into the shipping records of a port city to see if any orders for the jewlers' version of the oil seem suspicious, and Brom wonders why he never thought of this before when he'd previously hunted down assassins who'd used the caustic version.

As a **plot** development, this certainly couldn't form the basis for an entire mystery storyline without adding a whole bunch of extra steps, but as a sub-plot in the middle of a book where other things are happening, this is a pretty good one :)

But more importantly, as a **world-building** element, this is astonishing :D The real world has plenty of things like Draino and aluminum foil that are harmless in their intended purpose, yet dangerous – or even deadly – if used differently (deliberately or ignorantly), but how many times has this been used for fleshing out a piece of phlebotinum in a SciFi/Fantasy story?",1.0

"I thought the first two were really good, though I was also 17 when I read them, so I might not have had a mature eye for literature yet. I thought the story got bogged down midway through the third book and didn't recover in the fourth, and I grew increasingly annoyed with how oblivious Eragon was. But I still got through it without much trouble.

The series did have pretty good worldbuilding, and it made a strong impression on me as a medieval-style fantasy written with knowledge of modern science in mind (I don't know if there's a term for that).",1.0
"I definitely enjoyed Eragon but to be fair I was in middle school and couldn’t get enough fantasy. But it’s pretty insane he was 15 when he wrote it. Like, even if it’s not super great fiction, it was still good enough to become quite popular. Like imagine with Tolkien and GRRM were writing when they were 15. Was probably some shitty stuff.",1.0
"That's interesting to know. I didn't like Eragon either. I couldn't finish it, no matter how hard I tried.

Knowing he is cool about the fact that he wrote that very young is refreshing. I'll probably give his new sci-fi novel a go.",0.0

"I was about 13 when i first read Eragon. I'm gonna tell you, I HATED to read. I had tried other books and they all felt boring, massive and i could not stand one single page. To the point i thought reading was for dumb people because it was so boring.

A friend of mine gave to me Eragon. I read it in less than one week. It was just so engaging and made me feel inside the book. I'm not a expert by any means. But i really like Eragon. I have so many good memories of me reading that book, on the places i used to read. I have even read it multiple times when i was waiting the next release.

After Eragon I've read all sort of books. But Eragon is still my favorite book for above reason.",1.0

"Full honestly,   Eragon wasn't impressive.  It was a hodgepodge of tropes from every fantasy novel that was popular with young adults up to the late 90s.  He was just some 16 year old kid who's parents had a home-publishing business.  He was homeschooled in some remote place in montana and lived in his fantasy novels.  I can relate as a kid who grew up in a rural farming community.  In fairness, I bought a copy of his book from HIM at a renaissance faire in the late 90s,  one of the ones his family published and he was walking around selling out of his backpack,  so I've only ever read his home-published version that never saw a professional editor so maybe it was better afterwards.",0.0
"Might I ask at what age did you read his books? I think for someone young say in the 6-8 grade, it's a good starting point with pretty white black characters and easy story.
I read them as my first fantasy novels and it felt like a good introduction to the world of fantasy. I followed Eragon with LoTR and it was a bit easier I guess with the same species and characteristics.",1.0

"Like Harry Potter, Eragon is an amazing book series to read as a middle schooler. I remember me and my friends becoming obsessed with the magic system and dragon eggs, which we assumed (being 11) existed in real life as those polished egg-shaped rocks. This lead to my friend stealing one from the science teacher and getting busted after she searched every locker in the school, but that’s a whole other story. Anyways, the series might not hold up as an adult reading it but damn if it wasn’t perfect for younger me.",1.0
"So I had to look up the timelines so I could be accurate. Eragon came out, self-published, way back in 2001. Then got republished back from in 2003. I remember reading it back when I was in middle school. Say 2007, 2008. I would have been 12 or 13. I remember one of my friends, reading the book, and he told me his older brother read it. And he told me the author wrote it when he was 15. That's what first got me seriously interested. I'd had caught up with Harry Potter by that time. That means I'd had read Goblet of Fire, Order of Phoenix, and Half-Blood Prince. Read more Nancy Drew than I care to admit, and a decent bit of the Hardy Boys, found a few Sherlock Holmes. Anything Rick Riodan were the hot potatoes in my social circles. The Edge Chronical were plentiful, and of a good length to knock out in a weekend. Any Artemis Fowl book was good for the light reading of the day time. Animorphs or Goosebumps also could the lunch break, or study period gap. You get the idea, I spent more time reading, than eating. The Bartimaeus sequence was a recently new find, that had a good chunk to bite into. Something that actually satiated my appetite. Made me slow down a bit when I chewed. A decent book with a texture to the characters. The plotline was driven by more than one desire. Inkheart scratched similar itches. I've read Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Tangerine for English class. I could put in the work to finish something. If I wasn't enjoying what I read. That didn't matter. What mattered was that I finished the story. So I'm I'm sitting there, listening to my friend, tell me about this book, a 15 year old wrote. How it's a fantasy, with dragons, and people who could ride them. There's supernatural enemies too, with magic, elves, and sword fighting. Naturally, I listened politely at his enthusiasm. Inwardly, I was skeptical, cause while I agree, all of those elements were cool; I didn't think I could write a story at 15, I'd want to read at 13. I needed to know more stuff, right? To even just make a story that's worth someone else's time. So I'm eye-ing his book, estimating it might take me a week. Maybe a weekend too, if I was lazy with it, or focusing on other books. When he was done with it, I'd give it a shot. He finishes it, and lets me borrow it. I'm pretty sure I got in on a Tuesday. I gave it back Thursday. Within the next month I had my own copy. Since then I've kept up with the releases of the Inheritance Cycle. I'm ever thankful for Christopher Paolini, for proving me wrong. For showing me with keen imagination that a piece of art, worth spending some time on, can be made by a 15 year old. That it doesn't take an adult, with decades of experience to rely on, to make a book worth reading. I'm super excited to read something of his again. Having grown more into a palate sci-fi with Herbert, Asimov, Stephenson, and ~~His-name-who-shall-ever-be-forgotten~~ ^^orson ^^scott ^^card too; I expect Paolini to bless us with a wonderful read to grace our shelves with. Or add to our e-book collections. Who cares how you do it, its just reading.

I actually did like Eragon but the book after it (Eldest) I couldn't get through.,1.0
"Really?  Bit of a surprise.  I recall back in the day something about his staying away from criticism.  Which, of course, drew a bunch of criticism.

But no, they really weren't good books.  The hype was all in that a 15-year-old wrote them, but somehow at the same time the mass media was forgetting things like fictionpress and fanfiction were big at the time, filled with teenagers writing short stories and enormous epics.  I hope he does acknowledge the criticisms, though.  There's a surprising amount of value in them.  Personally, I've found out about as much in how to become a good writer by deconstructing works like Eragon (among others) as I have in more classically good works such as The Lord of the Rings.  Which means he has all the more tools to correct his deficiencies.",0.0
"Nope, you are not. I'm not a critic, I understand that he didn't invent elves and dwarves and their characteristics etc, but I re-read the books many, many times and every time was a pleasure.

"That always feels like a patronizing angle to me. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein at 18...

"Lmao thats the perfect way to describe it and I agree, I love the concept of warding and mental magical battles that he used.

"I actually learned something really interesting from the books. At first I didn't like Eragon's brother's chapters. I wanted to get back to the magic and elves and shit. 

But the dude ended up being much cooler and more clever. I realized that it was because he was *underpowered* that he had the space to become a more interesting character.

 It's something that Jim Butcher has talked about, that  handicapping your characters means they have to be more creative with their solutions.",1.0
"I could not sit down and read at all until I picked up Eragon in 3rd grade. As an 8 or 9 year old, that book was the culmination of all of my interests (mainly dragons) and put me in the right direction towards all of Rick Riordan's series, Lotr, Harry Potter, etc. 

Haven't reread any of the Paolini books since then so they still stand near the pinnacle of the fantasy genre for me.",1.0
"This. Too many authors are cautious to fully define a magic system, because people will pick it apart and find any and every loophole. It has to make sense to its core if your going to break it way down. Harry Potter doesnt have to explain it further than magic words, make magic spell, and they even show that its not a scientific art for most wizards because they end up hurting/maiming/killing others/themselves while creating new magics.

But Eragon did such a good job of explaining the magic, that it really turned into a science of energy manipulation. Conversion of energy to make one thing into another, to focus light through water to make fire, it was just moving energy around and Paolini did a great job of keeping it mysterious and vague early on, and then expanding upon it across 3 more books til it was a full and robust system, with logic to how stuff was structured and how the magic even came to be. Even down to the telepathy/affecting others minds. Because of their ability to manipulate magic/energy, they just pushed their consciousness outside themselves to touch another mind/energy. Explained down to it, it almost seems plausible.",1.0
"Hard magic systems is not a new thing to fantasy writing. Soft magic systems when executed properly also isn't just 'lol magic'd'.

Farm boy (eragon/luke) living with uncle comes home to find home destroyed and family dead due to agents of the empire. Wise old man (brom/obi wan) who's secretly been keeping watch over farm boy accompanies farm boy on ensuing quest. Wise old man has sword belonging to farm boy's father (anakin's lightsaber/zar'roc) and passes it down to farm boy. Turns out wise old man had connection to farm boy's father (anakin/morzan). Yes i know morzan isn't actually the dad as of book 3 but i'm just talking about the first 2 books. Also turns out wise old man is a member of an ancient but destroyed order (Jedi/Dragon Riders) and teaches farm boy the ways of said order until he tragically dies in front of farm boy. Farm boy rescues princess (arya/leia) and then seeks to join hidden rebel forces (Varden/Rebel Alliance). Farm boy is instrumental in victory at yhe end of first installment (destroying death star/killing durza). It was nice that eragon would have died here had it not been for arya/saphira. After, farm boy travels to secluded tree land (dagobah/du weldenvarden) and finds that an even older hermit of the old order is still alive (yoda/oromis). Proceeds to train with old hermit, but leaves prematurely to join fight, promising to come back and finish training. During fight, farm boy gets rekt and learns the horrible truth about his father (vader/morzan).

Also razac=nazgul in book 1, until he fleshes them out more in later books. There was the whole sequence of the razac/nazgul coming to carvahall/shire because farm boy chanced across egg/ring.

"I was a kid when I read his books and thought they were bad. I knew plenty of teenagers who wrote fantasy too, some of whom were just as good and prolific as Paolini. But he got published because his parents were publishers. Not saying he's a bad guy or deserved anything more than honest criticism, but I understand the frustrated people who see a 15yo getting praise for being in the right place at the right time. It's impressive to write a book. And for most young authors, it takes years or even a lifetime to get published. It's like when a bad director gets a film deal because his parents are in the industry. If they obviously dont put out quality work, they probably didn't earn that opportunity. As a kid, I was confused and frustrated to see his book get published and receive praise until I realized how it happened. Then the world made sense again. I don't have a problem with anyone reading Eragon and enjoying it, but I have no qualms about criticizing it very heavily. There's plenty of well written YA literature out there. And as someone said, Shelley was 18 when she wrote one of the greatest novels ever written. I don't have a problem keeping the bar firmly in place for young people with a golden ticket.",0.0
"Especially the empathy bomb thing Eragon does to make Gabatorix kill himself. That's super fucking clever and despite being heavily foreshadowed it still comes as a surprise. 

I think the people who say his story is unoriginal just haven't finished the series. Only the first one is super derivative. The last 3 are all pretty fucking unique.",1.0
"I liked that the world wasnt fixed by Galbatorix being dethroned and how they acknowledged the very real  threat that Eragon could have crowned himself and it wouldn't really have been controversial to anyone other than the rulers. 

It made sense that someone so revered would need to disappear to allow the rulers to maintain authority. 

Galbatorix losing in a duel would be absolute bullshit. It doesnt matter how powerful Eragon was. Galbatorix at that point was more god than mortal. 

The relationship with the elf woman never made sense to me but it was handled well enough by separating them. 

I'm not pretending this is high art. But a victorious yet ultimately sad ending is exactly what I want from stories like this.

edit: Just remembered this. The appearance of Shuirkan (I think that was the dragons name) genuinely shook me. The description of its size and  mental state was perfect for the story.",1.0
"Eh, I started reading the series while I was in 5th grade, and it really was my first big fantasy series, so I will always be thankful for that. However, even as a teen I knew that the third and last book were deeply disappointing. The green dragon never mattered, the last Drago Rider was the most obvious choice, and the explanation why Eragon had to leave was ridiculous. If I remember correctly, they argued that the new dragons would eat all the sheep and therefor had to go? 

This new book might come a bit too late, since I assume there wasn’t much good will left after that Lord of the Ring spin-off ending and must people probably moved on to better fantasy.",0.0

You can feel, that the author had a great vision of this actually well built world, but not much experience, so the writing was not that good.
I came back to my friend, giving him the book. He asked if I want the second part, but I shaked my head. He looked disappointed, but understood my thoughts.",0.0
I tried rereading recently and was honestly  suprised how much I despised Eragon and his arrogance; followed with how much I liked Murtagh in the early books which was completely opposite of my feelings as a kid. I couldnt get past book two because of how insufferable Eragon actually was and how much of an asshole he was to Murtagh. Maybe this book will help me get back into the universe.,0.0
"I just reread them and they're mostly great. Is it on the same level creatively as the Scholomance trilogy? Nope. But I think they hold up really well, I'm especially glad Eragon and Arya >!don't just wind up shoehorned together, and Eragon gets smacked (figuratively) every time he ignores her clearly stated wishes!<",1.0
"As a kid I absolutely adored the books, but even then I knew it could get really, really clumsy at points, especially when the characters had to make a decision of any kind. Everything needed to be explained and debated - all alternatives needed to be thoroughly debunked before we could proceed.

Let’s take Murtagh and Eragon’s fight at the end of the second book as an example. Before they fight, the two of them have a debate as to why Murtagh doesn’t just surrender or give up. Why are they fighting? Murtagh swore an oath. Why doesn’t he join the rebel cause? Magic oath. Why doesn’t he just let Eragon kill him? He doesn’t want to die. This back-and-forth goes on for upwards of *3 pages!*

It’s almost like Paolini doesn’t trust that, unless the answer was glaringly obvious from the get-go, a reader’s first instinct probably won’t be to pick apart a character’s decision-making process. Having it happen once or twice is one thing, but he does this constantly, as if he’s justifying to the reader why things need to happen the way they do. Why Eragon can’t be with his elven love-interest, why Eragon needs to leave at the end of the series, there’s even a debate as to why he doesn’t just try to use magic to *raise his mentor from the dead.*

Even so, I still hold a great deal of respect what Paolini’s accomplished. He’s a published fantasy author, with a full series of novels under his belt. That’s a hell of a lot farther than I’ve gotten with my own writing. What Eragon is, at the end of the day, is a huge passion project, and I think Paolini’s passion definitely shows.",0.0
"I am 44 and read them all in intended (not chronological by year published) and ""enjoyed"" them. They were a fun, fairly quick read - probably about the same time it would take me to get through Fellowship of the Ring and maybe half of The Two Towers.

This is where I drop the ""but"": I wish I read these books when I was in my early teens. When I read through the Tales of Prydain. After Prydain I discovered Stephen King and (shudder) Clive Cussler. I didn't wind-up reading LoTR until I was in college and, even then, wish I had read THOSE books sooner, too.

Personally, I prefer Tolkein to Lewis but, like I said, I read them first in college and - as an English Lit major - there is SO much depth that LoTR keeps me coming back over and over again. Maybe I was looking too hard for the same thing in the Chronicles of Narnia.

Maybe 40-something is a bit too old but, for all of that, the books did engross me. The story and settings kept me immersed. And, after it all, I went back and re-watched the ""original"" cartoon of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (from 1979) with my daughters.",1.0

I read them all, but I don't see myself likely to re-read any but the first 3.  & as for the religious references, they only started to bother me in the last book (The Last Battle) & that's because Lewis is basically beating the reader over the head w/ the references there.",1.0
The chronicles of Narnia aren't good reads for a child,0.0
"I enjoy the Chronicles of Narnia, but in a similar vein (but more adult, definitely) is the His Dark Materials series, by Phillip Pullman. It has a similar ""otherworldly"" aspect to it, while also plunging further into that, as well as much deeper themes and darker moments, all without the ""childishness"" that seems to peep through Chronicles of Narnia's writing.

There are also religious themes, but rather than being about the substance of the religion itself, it's more about the practice and commentary on organized religion. However, I think it's better incorporated into the story, and is less prominent than in Narnia. 

The first book is the Golden Compass, or Northern Lights in the UK, and it recently got made into an HBO series.",1.0

Each time I read it I come away with a new view of the series and a new appreciation for the writing style. I look forward to visiting Narnia again soon.",1.0
"Once you read them pick up The Magicians books by Lev Grossman, which are a reimagining of The Chronicles of Narnia as a present day sequel through modern eyes, written for adults. Narnia is transparently known as Fillory in these books, and the main characters are essentially responding to The Chronicles of Narnia as historical text in the context of magic being real and underground in our world, requiring people to go to college to learn it. (So there's an element of responding to Harry Potter here too.)

The TV series based upon The  Magicians books is also one of the few book to series adaptations which is even better than the books.

I adored the Dark Materials for all the same reasons I loved the Chronicles of Narnia. They both give us new worlds to explore and to bring to life in our own minds. I think it's entirely possible to enjoy both and to pass the messaging over with a grain of salt.,1.0
"Whole-hearted agreement.  The Chronicles of Narnia might be the only series I have read more than twice.  Every. Single. Time.  I become enamored with the world, the characters and the story.  To this day when I picture the end of all things and the transition I picture the running through fields of green and over hills without tiredness or fatigue.  Freedom and Joy.  I only get sad because the stories are over.  But they'll be there again when I re-read them in a few years.  

P.S. I recommend to others the original reading/written order: Leaving the Magician's Nephew as the 2nd to last book, and not reading it ""chronologically correct"" as the 1st book.  The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is very much meant to be the first book.  Edit in: The stories mostly stand on their own, and so it's not a necessity to read them in *any* specific order.  I like the order in which I originally read them.  If you haven't read them, they're pretty straight forward easy reads, but in a timeless way. ",1.0
"The Chronicles of Narnia will always be special to me. My Mum had the set as a child, and in a house fire lost all but three. I inherited those three, still charred around the edges. I read them, loved them, and wanted the whole series. 

So I saved my pocket money and bought three of the others through the school book club, leaving only one to collect. Then when I was twelve I won a drawing competition at school and as the teacher knew I was missing one more book, he got me a hard cover of The Last Battle as the prize. I was so happy!

Those books, three still charred, three book club soft covers, and one hard cover are safely tucked in the cupboard to this day.

But it definitely is weird reading them now - so many things that wooshed right by me as a kid. The Christian stuff I can mostly ignore, but one thing that stood out to on a recent read was Experiment House! Where the foolish experiment of girls and boys going to school together turned almost everyone into stupid, layabout hooligans!",1.0
"The Chronicles of Narnia are some of my all time favorite books. When I was very young and still learning how to read, my mom read the LWW to me and my brothers, and I listened to the [Focus on the Family Radio Theatre](http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Battle_(Focus_of_the_Family_Radio_Theatre)) version millions of times. I can still remember many of the quotes word for word in the various actor's voices. It really fed my desire to learn how to read and understand the world around me, seen or unseen.

When I got older I read the books, and it sparked my appetite for books and reading for the rest of my life. Once in a while, I'll reread them and notice things that resonate within me in a way they hadn't before or just appreciate how lyrical and smooth Lewis's storytelling is even years later. CS Lewis has a way of putting complex concepts and thoughts into words in a way that easy to understand, yet completely summarizes everything that it is in within the boundary of a few words.

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is my favorite book of the series as it has the atmosphere of adventure and mystery while simultaneously giving the melancholy feeling of reading both an ending and a beginning. Reepicheep's final goodbye and journey into Aslan's Country gets me right in the feels every time I read it. 

The Horse and His Boy is my second favorite as I was an avid horse lover when I was younger, but also because I loved that it how it was the perfect story with a good ending. ",1.0
"The Chronicles of Narnia was the first book set I ever owned.  I got it for Christmas when I was six. At the time my mom was reading them to my sister and I every day while we ate lunch, and I couldn't wait til we got around to finishing the series together, so I spent hours reading ahead and then squealing with anticipation as she read them out loud. Those books hold a lot of happy memories for me.  ",1.0
"Aw, my dad did the same for me when I was in 2nd grade or so. They gave me the first three books for Christmas, and then the last four for my birthday (the following May). To this day, I haven't read a book that's stuck with me like those did. 

I don't know if I'll ever have kids, but if I do, I will absolutely read them the Chronicles of Narnia. ",1.0

My aunt gave The Chronicles of Narnia to me sometime around when I was six. At first I didn't want to read them because they didn't have pictures, so my parents started reading them to me. I quickly became engrossed in the stories and started reading ahead just to see what happened next. 

From there I went on to *The Hobbit* and I was hooked. ",1.0
"I read all of them when I was in 7th grade and they immediately fell under one of my favorite fantasy series of all time. 

""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is definitely my favorite out of the entire series. Maybe it's a bit too cliché to say it but I have to go with my childhood memories haha. ""The Magician's Nephew"" is definitely my second favor the, followed by ""Prince Caspjan"".

These stories to me where so wonderful and illuminating in so many ways. I had gone through a domestic violence situation around the same time I began reading the series. Reading these books really helped me get past these horrible things happening at home and brought me to this magical world where the imagination was infinite. 

I ended up writing a speech about reading ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" for my Academic Decathlon competition and ended up with a Gold medal. 

Needless to say, reading could be quite magical. ",1.0
"I absolutely love the Chronicles of Narnia and I've read all of them several times. The best way to read them is in order, starting with the Magicians Nephew, not with the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. The Horse and his Boy is the best one followed by the Silver Chair. The worst one is the Last Battle. That book never fails to bring me to tears every time I read it, especially because I always related well with Susan. ",1.0
"I love Harry Potter.  I love the Chronicles of Narnia.  They attempt to do different things, and so I treasure each for what they bring.  I think comparing them to each other does each a disservice.

That being said, I love each of them for something different.  I actually thought the Silver Chair was one of my favorites, because I loved imagining the underground-people and their rivers of lava and ""living jewels.""  

As some have said, Lewis was a better academic than he was a writer, but in his writing I find incredible ideas and images, and it's in these settings and possibilities that I love to go back to again and again.  The Magician's Nephew is a lovely creation-story, but it's not my favorite overall, which is probably the Horse and His Boy.  As for the Dawn Treader, I love that because of the characters we meet--specifically the final character, the star who was banished to Narnia for misdeeds and must grow younger everyday by eating berries picked from the high mountains.  And who can forget Reepicheep, one of my favorite characters in all the series?

Just remember, these were written a long time ago.  They were ground-breaking then, and the fact that so many still cherish these stories goes to show that there are many universal ideas presented in a boiled-down way that resonates with a lot of people.  If they don't satisfy you, there's nothing wrong with that.  We are all different people.  But I would call the CON masterpieces in their own right.  Their profound effect on children's literature should speak for itself.",1.0

"In no particular order:

* The Chronicles of Prydain - The series that introduced me to High Fantasy. And until this day, I maintain, has one of the best coming of age stories written. Fantasy is still by far my favorite genre.

* Harry Potter - I grew up on Harry Potter like most 90s kids. At the time like a lot of them, I was obsessed about it. This got me into collecting memorabilia and buying multiple editions of the same book because of the cover. 

* The Chronicles of Narnia - The Horse and His Boy was my favorite title from the series. It didn't really age well. And I felt that the allusions to religion and Christianity got really in your face as the story was ending. I didn't really know it then, but maybe those were already signs pointing towards me being Agnostic.

* Shadow Children - As a kid, I thought this was a pretty dark story. Whereas I was used to knights, monsters and triumphing over evil, this was the most grounded book series I read at the time. Even in the first book, the event near the end was pretty shocking to me. I may not be a ride or die activist but I'm pretty outspoken about topics to push for equality and acceptance. 

* The Count of Monte Cristo - The very first book I ever read by myself. This was the book that started my love affair with reading. I was 9 and confined to bed rest after a head injury with nothing much to do. This book kept me company. 

+Bonus: As an adult -

* Mistborn Trilogy - my first foray into adult fantasy and introduced me to hard magic systems which I adore. Rediscovered my love of reading after several years of being in a rut.",1.0

"The Magician's Nephew and The Horse and His Boy each have unique flavors from the rest of the series. There's something so infinite about The Magician's Nephew, I always tried to imagine the various worlds beyond the doors. I have memories of reading The Horse and His Boy in a stable while waiting for my sister to be done with her horseback riding lessons.

I see TLTW&TW, Prince Caspian, and Dawn Treader as the meat of the series; they're very actiony with the strongest sense of continuity among them. Dawn Treader, being the 3rd written, makes the transition to exploring the edges of Lewis's world literally and figuratively. I was fascinated by this aspect and especially invested in Reepicheep. I'm glad that Silver Chair is getting a lot of love in this thread, it's one of my favorites. Puddleglum is a great character, and I liked seeing Eustace's character development.

The Last Battle is for me, like many others, the least favorite. Lewis gave in to his worst instincts with the apocalyptic themes here.

I think, looking back, that the Chronicles of Narnia cultivates a sense of transience and nostalgia. Lewis shows us moments of great beauty and great horror, then snatches them away. He taps into the fear of growing up, and he hints at mysteries never solved and tales never told. It makes Narnia feel so much bigger and more alive than what is actually revealed to us.",1.0

LotR was a major challenge given the dialects and world building intricacies. You can read these even when your kids are young. You'll be amazed at how much comprehension 6-8 year olds can handle.


I wouldn't trade doing that for anything. What a great experience for them, as well as my wife and I. If you read to children they will learn to not see it as a chore. When they are old enough, it is almost just as essential that you listen raptly as they start reading back to you. We started reading the Potter series to them, and by Order of the Phoenix they began reading them back to us. I've actually never read HBP and TDH...but I have had them read to me.

TLDR; Even though a real demand, read your children The Hobbit and LotR. You'll be rewarded 10 fold.",1.0
"I think that is why I despised them. The Hobbit is a beautiful lyric story that reads like a lovely warm poem with a great sense of danger and wonder. 

The Hobbit movies, everyone seems snarky and self involved. I will never forgive them for putting CGI before story and to make everything an action hero movie. Michael Bay-ing the Hobbit was an afront to humanty. I hated the dwarves. Radagast with battle sleigh with Rabbits? I noped the fuck out.",1.0
"I'll push back on that a bit. I read both back in the pre cell phone instant gratification days, and I loved the Hobbit to bits, but stalled out and never finished Return of the King. 

It wasn't ADHD, I just didn't enjoy the poems and songs, nor the paragraphs of text describing a mountain or whatever. They didn't add anything for me, and thus felt like just a slog. 

I was happily reading other 500-800 page books at the time, most of that Fantasy, so it wasn't attention span or laziness. 

I went back to The Hobbit long after I was ""too old"" for it, and still enjoyed it immensely. I've never tried Lord of the Rings again. I may one day, but if I do I'll let myself skip over all the songs and skim read any descriptions of topography that go on longer than a paragraph :)",1.0
"You might be right about the ADHD.  I read LOTR when I was 12 and had never been a reader of books, and probably had ADHD but I was blown away.  I remember constantly imagining the world I was in, hearing the sounds, the songs, tasing the lembras bread.  My mind, thanks the Tolkien's words, was fully immersed.  I would even make tapping noises with my feet to simulate the sound of the horse walking (I can't remember what section was from) as I read.  Of course a teacher told me to knock it lol.  The pace wasn't breakneck speed which is good because it allowed me to figure out what the hell was going on.  I have the type of ADHD where I focus on everything at the same time.  I couldn't never get into The Hobbit as a kid because it was pretty overstimulating.  Something about LOTR was cooler too.  As an adult I probably would go back and read The Hobbit before LOTR, strange as it sounds based on what I wrote.  Now my imagination isn't as dense and vivid as it was as a child and I find LOTR harder to get into.",1.0
"I was 12 and stuck at my grandparents back in '85. Tere were no kids close to mine or my brother's age nor was there even a park close. They didn't have cable and I was bored to death in their guest room. I came across a shelf with several green hard covered books. Each had gold writing and were very nondescript. I know now that it was some kind of classics series that my grandmother picked up somewhere as it had books from people like Mark Twain in it.

But one book had a name that made me want to see what it was about. In little gold letters were the words ""The Hobbit"". Out of boredom I began to read. I started mid morning and only stopped due to having to re-read some portions or words because I had a limited vocabulary or because I had to come eat dinner. I finished the book that night somewhere well after midnight and before dawn. 

It started a life long love affair with fantasy novels as well as spawned an immense love of reading. I couldn't even begin to tell you how many books I've read since then or even half the authors but I can tell you I read. A lot. Some of it over and over and some once and done. That one book, written years before I was even born, opened up an entire world for me and then continued to open many more. I will ever love and be grateful to Tolkien for The Hobbit.",1.0

The Hobbit and To Kill A Mockingbird are my two favorite books of all time. Incredible choice for your first full book. ,1.0
"This has been the first r/books thread I could actually give my two cents in as I’m currently reading Return of the King, and am loving every second of it. 

A huge thing I noticed is that it’s about 90% easier to read The Hobbit than it is to read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and for good reason. The Hobbit is the *perfect* introduction to Middle-Earth: you get to see all the races of the world and learn their special talents, you get the classic quest of venturing to slay a dragon (not to imagine the excitement of learning the thing talks), and its language is generally simple enough for even a child to be able to immerse themselves in it. 

Then comes the Lord of the Rings. As you read it you can tell this has been Tolkien’s magnum opus. An artfully worded and masterfully detailed telling of the most crucial times to happen in Middle-Earth. It’s honestly incredible how seriously you take the events that are happening and how easily you can imagine them. This series is one of my biggest recommendations.  

Like a few said this series is a great way to learn and really feel like you know English. It’s written in a way that feels like centuries ago. I actually have a a page in the notes app of my phone for every new word Tolkien teaches me. 

Tolkien’s method of story telling is literally genre-founding material. Of course the fantasy genre has been around for centuries but Tolkien’s world of Middle-Earth set the bar. Hell, it created the bar. 

I’m sorry, I just got excited when I saw I book that I love finally get a thread. My favorite part of The Hobbit has to be “Riddles in the Dark” when we first meet Gollum, and first encounter the One True Ring, with absolutely no idea what is to come.",1.0
It's a great book. I'm actually reading it. I've seen the movies and all of the Lord of the rings. I own all of the books. I want to read them in order. I read somewhere that the Hobbit was actually written AFTER the Lord of the rings due to publishing... Don't quote me on that. ,1.0

"The hobbit is, I think, Tolkien's best work because it was meant as a children's introduction to middle-earth and much of the other works are very involved as far as comprehension and world building. It's a hard formula to get right and I think the movies made a huge mistake by trying to beef up the story to make it more exciting and make more money(more movies). By extending the story over such a long time frame you screw up the overall pacing.",1.0
"The Hobbit still one of my all time favorites. It can be read as a quaint little evolution of a fairy tale, yet it has some heavy hitting moments and it really builds an amazing adventure.

It might be the only perfect Fantasy book. And I've read literally thousands.

To this day, when I play Dungeons and Dragons and am coming up with a new character I always end up thinking ""this character would be better as a halfling"".

And I was lucky enough to spend some time in the English countryside when I graduated high school and every field of bracken, or shady tree ever a backing brook brought me back to the shire.",1.0

It flows so freely and the language that it's written is extremely simple (i guess that fact is understandable since it's considered a children's book?), the characters are all great, etc. I was left extremely surprised and pleased by this book and I can't wait to read the trilogy now.

I had put of reading the Hobbit because I loved the majesty and high stakes of LOTR. But reading it gave me such a new impression of Bilbo (I remembered the rough plot from the old animated movie I had watched as a kid). I feel in LOTR Bilbo comes off as a bit pompous and overblown considering how much Frodo admires him. But after the Hobbit I get it, he did so much! He was brave and clever, and level headed under pressure. It will definitely give me a new perspective him in on my next read through of LOTR.",1.0

Most of the language is fine but there are some words that are dated and hard for kids to connect with.

However, after a number of complete readings it became apparent that she had followed - and grown to love - the story. Since she enjoyed The Hobbit perhaps she would also enjoy LotR, but this was not the case.

I speculate this is because The Hobbit is more linear and, comparitively, faster paced than The Lord of the Rings - as the vocabulary is not that much different between the two.
 
I've struggled to find other novels that appeal to her, e.g. Harry Potter, but to no avail. I wonder if that's because it breaks the formula of The Hobbit: Linear, A to B, and no flashbacks, forwards or parallel narratives.",1.0

I'm fairly certain it was his first foray into middle-earth, so hand holding is also expected to a degree, but Tolkien was a stickler for details.

It's also easy to go go in deep when explaining things, he did go on to create a fictional universe, complete with languages and a litany of backstories explaining the origin of that world with stories that predate the events of the hobbit by several thousand years.

Still a great book.

"It's so interesting at this point because Tolkien wasn't writing the Hobbit to be part of his big mythology. It was just a magical tale with a funny, humble hero.

I mean if you are going to kill a character and deliver a more emotional punch. At least, build up the character and the scenes with that character before killing her/him off.

In the Royal Ranger series, he didn't even do a good job showing the effects her death had on Will. Aside for the fact, that he was just angry and nothing else.  Him having an apprentice was IMO for John to kill off Alyss without expanding the impact her death had on Will.

That being said, if Ranger Apprentice does have a Movie/tv series then they must eventually kill her off ,or else it won't be the same.

I am so glad someone finally made a post about this.  In 7th grade my English teacher had a poster of the book in his classroom and I asked him what the poster is for.  He told me about the book and then I decided to buy it.  I attempted to read it but was unable to do so at first.  Then many years later I decided to give it another shot and then realized my mother decided to give the book away.  I went out to buy another copy and finally managed to get through the whole book.  Tough to get started on reading it but once you're determined enough to read the whole thing you realize it was worth it.

It has the character’s names on the left side and the chapter scenes along the top. Each box that applies to that character has his activity penciled in it.

"I read *Catch-22* multiple times in high school. I was fascinated by it, and liked it, but didn't really *get it.* I kept reading it hoping that I decode it, figure out why it effected me so much, and fascinated me so much. Every time I read it, I would see something else, but I still couldn't really explain why it had the effect on me that it did.

And then I read David Milch's memoir last year (Milch is a TV writer most famous for *Deadwood* and *NYPD Blue*) and he wrote this passage about a class on writing that he used to teach at Yale:

> What I was trying to teach was the idea that the reader or the audience's experience of a work, how they feel as they go through it, is what conveys the work's argument, and that experience is usually different from the actual words. Another way of saying it is that form shapes content. With *Moby-Dick,* your faculties of understanding are exhausted by the work itself, and it's by having your faculties totally and utterly exhausted that you can feel Ahab's obession with the whale and Ishmael's obsession with the story. ""I'm taking it all in and I'm overwhelmed and I'm still not sure exactly what it means."" That's what it means. Henry James uses a different tactic--he introduces a new character to the world and then through that character's misapprehension the reader comes to apprehend the world more clearly.
>
> This was a writing class, but I went into it through reading. It's too much for a young student to constantly be looking at their or their classmates' work. If you bring something already taken for granted as literature and you workshop that, then we can have some fun. To suggest that our greatest writers might have been struggling with our same feelings, which we know for a fact they were, is a good thing for a writer to live into. There are ways to turn problems of spirit into problems of technique--that's another kind of indirection. Kafka was just a miserable, miserable human being. Pathologically shy and physically ill, but he wanted to tell stories. So Gregor Samsa woke up and discovered he was a bug. All of his misery is now a problem of technique. How does a bug live in a family where the rest are human beings?

And I get it. I understand the structure and impact of Catch 22 so much better than before. ""This is stressful and repetitive and I keep reliving the same shit over and over and I'm overwhelmed and I'm not sure exactly what it means."" *That's what it means.*",1.0

That saying goes ""Comedy is tragedy that happens to other people"" , and that's true. We hardly see the humour in daily life, because daily life directly affects us.

The supposed ""anti-elitism"" on the right is a complete lie. It's just a reaction to a society where they're not allowed to call their coworkers a ""faggot"" anymore, as evidenced by how their greatest ""anti-elite"" champion is a billionaire New Yorker who shits in a gold toilet and spent a lifetime deeply ensconced in the world of celebrity cults ... just because he says outrageous transgressive bullshit that makes weak people feel briefly powerful. They're not anti-elitist, they're anti-decency. Their overriding concern is that society should validate their cruelty, and when it doesn't, it's a grand conspiracy by the ""elites.""

There is not any sort of great narrative shift where it turns into a linear story, so, if you are waiting for that, temper your expectations :) (and maybe it just isn't the book for you. Nothing wrong with that).

But!!!

While the style remains the same, it is kind of like puzzle pieces that are randomly dropping into place. After 12% of the pieces fall, you look at it and say ""WTF is this, it makes no sense"". But as more and more of the puzzle pieces fall, they are still random, but they begin to fill in the picture, and you see more and more of the whole. And as you get to the end it all comes together and you see all these interconnected parts that were randomly dropped in.

This is how it happened to me, at least, and I loved it, and it was a hilarious ride getting there. But as I said, not everyone has the same experience. If you are only 12% of the way in, I would recommend giving it another little bit until you are at least 20% or 30%. If you still think it is terrible, drop it. Like I said, it isn't for everyone.

The other advice I would give is to not view it as a ""running joke about how crazy everyone is"". The characters aren't crazy; they are living in a crazy situation, and it affects all of them differently. A good example that comes to mind is Yossarian's argument with Clevinger about how ""Everyone is trying to kill him"". Depending on your point of view, either Yossarian or Clevinger (or both) seem crazy. But actually neither of them say anything that isn't true.

"I think may be reading *just* a bit too far into it.  But I also don't think Heller would be upset about your conclusions.  I believe he was interested in writing a book that had broad themes and satire and could be used as small spotlight on any absurd issue.

Just a note on Sweden.  It was not socialist at the time, nor is it socialist today.  It is a social democracy which is based on capitalism.  The role Sweden plays in the book is more general and mainly that Sweden is *neutral* and wants no part of the war, which is how Yossarian himself feels.  

The book itself is a broad satire and in general is about the extreme absurd-ism that is the military and bureaucracy.  It points out the concept of promoting problems up (ie it is easier to promote someone to get rid of them, then it is to actually remove them), miscommunication, ego, greed, etc.  

Then the ultimatum theme is personal integrity vs institution.  Yossarian tries to follow personal integrity and he looks for it in others, but he keeps coming up against the institution with it's ""Catch-22"".  Only the institution really gets to use Catch-22 though, individuals are always at the whim of the institution and are not able to use Catch-22.  The is really the main point and the book goes out of its way to keep selling that point.  The other points are just added on fun for the book.",1.0

"I've read it a few times. There are some passages that are simply brilliant, possibly beyond anything else Heller ever wrote (Milo Minderbinder negotiating for a military contract left me in pain from laughing so much). However, on the whole, it's not nearly as good as *Catch-22* or a lot of other work by Heller. 

There are a few 'deleted chapters' from *Catch-22* in *Catch as Catch Can* that are well worth reading. 

*Something Happened* \- as someone has noted below - is Heller's next greatest work, albeit so uncommercial it's difficult to say it's better than *Catch-22*. But an incredible, brave and darkly disturbing novel if ever there was one.",1.0

* The first 3/4 of the book is more a disjointed collection of short stories around the same people.  It all comes together in the end.

"I read it in college and while I definitely didn't ""hate"" it, I wasn't taken by it. Much of what people in this thread have noted about repetitiveness has been said, but I'll agree with it. Being intentionally tedious isn't much better than unintentionally tedious. And the same joke premise gets stale no matter how funny it is.

I also think I don't connect to the style/themes of the book very strongly. Absurdism rarely works for me as a reader; it makes it hard for me to care. I found it similarly frustrating to read Slaughterhouse 5, another Reddit favorite. Absurdist lit just feels cynical in a very unlikable way. It asks the reader to do work in parsing the story, but ultimately the reward for the work is a middle finger, because the story will never really make total sense. I understand that this is a sort of meta-commentary on the painful needlessness of war, but it's not a ride I feel like signing myself up on.

To be clear, I don't think Catch-22 is a ""bad book"". It has real humor and intelligence and ideas, and even I enjoyed moments of it. I just find it difficult to connect to on the whole. I'm more than willing to read a bleak war novel, but the hyper-jaded, sardonic narrator felt too unlikable for me to connect with emotionally and too repetitive for me to invest in intellectually.",0.0
"It is a wonderful book, but I think the cyclic nature of the storytelling throws people off early in the book. This is actually the most powerful  aspect of the story iny opinion because it slowly reveals just what a crazy world you have been thrust into by slowly revealing deatials that seemed out of context previously. I think most people read the first chapter or two and assume that this is a flaw in the writing, not an intentional technique and give up too early.

There was an animated movie in the early 2000s (Hoodwinked) that used a similar storytelling technique and I thought it was great but no matter who I loaned the DVD to, they invariably said they just couldn't get into it. I think they watched the first part and when it went back to the beginning of the story to tell it from another character's point of view, they somehow felt like it had tricked them or wasted their time.

Bottom line is, if people would stick with Catch-22 for three or four chapters, I think they would be hooked.",1.0

Highly recommended.

Without giving it away for anyone who hasn't read it yet, there was a point I pulled out my dictionary after seeing the same word I didn't really understand for like ... the 5th time. When I saw the definition of the word I realized that both I and the character in the book Yossarian had been using it on were both being mocked by not actually knowing what the word meant but going forward as if we did.

I'm laughing so hard one minute, the next I'm wondering why is the death of these man (who pretty much die one by one) and the monstrosities of war so funny for me.

However I'm wondering about one thing. Is Snowden's >!death!< widely considered the climax of the book? Because I don't think it really is. It's just there to put the actual emotional climax of the book, the >!raping and killing of prostitute!< by the good old Aarfy in Rome is the actual climax of the book. The Snowden bit is there to put it all into perspective. The sheer absurdity of considering one being innocent or guilty in the time of war, human life having no value (they're all pretty much there to go through the moves), it all comes to a climax during that one last trip to Rome.

And I believe the reason people tend to miss this on their first reading is because it's IMMEDIATELY undercut by the military police taking Yossarian into custody due to him being AWOL.

Anyone else has similar thoughts about this?",1.0
"*Catch-22* was the most un-funny book I ever read. All the ""clever"" back and forth felt like hacky Joss Whedon wannabe stuff.

"Okay check this out. I read this book forever ago and didn't like it. A lot of that was probably because it was 20 years ago and I didn't get it.

But there's something else going on. Catch-22 wasn't enjoyable for me because it was SO EFFECTIVE as a satire that it became too similar to the thing it was satirizing (military bureacracy) and was mostly dry and boring for me. I wasn't grasping the subtleties and the clever prose because I wasn't piercing the surface. 

Satirists need to watch this shit; it's similar to what happened with Stephen Colbert where his portrayal of the other side was so effective that some of them were briefly taken in.

"Catch-22 is my favourite novel. Closing Time is not my second favourite but it's still masterful, put it that way. 

If you love Catch-22 then you'll enjoy it for sure. It's much darker, sadder and realistic than its prequel. It's sad to see the humorous, energetic characters that I loved from Catch-22 ageing and dealing with late life but that's also the challenge of this book. It forces you to deal with the pattern of life and it uncompromisingly compares the harshness of war with the harshness of banal domestic life. 

I would say Catch-22 captures the chaotic, bizarre, weirdly humorous world of war where nothing makes sense once you start questioning and you just don't understand it. But Closing Time describes the strange, confusing world of growing up and ageing where nothing makes sense and no one understands you anymore. 

Closing Time is a heavy come-down after the ""fun"" of Catch-22. But it's real and raw and I can't argue with it.",1.0
Jurassic Park’s one of the few books where I strongly prefer the movie.

"GOD. YES. 
Ok so lemme point out that Jurassic Park is still one of my favorite novels, and one of two I make sure to reread yearly (the other is The Last Unicorn). And I bring that up because Lex is more enraging than Haggard's insufferable rants on objectification and the meanings of happiness. It is quite possibly one of the only times I vastly preferred that the plot was altered for the film (also my favorite movie.) 
Both are wonderful storylines that change hugely based on the portrayal of Hammond, Wu, and the kids - one made very dark and thrilling and menacing, and the other full of hard lessons of idealism and strength through teamwork. Idk, I know at this point I'm definitely rambling, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that I have a lot of love for this story, and the differences (mostly) strengthened that. 
Also, I would give The Lost World a peek. It's pretty awful, and at this point it's basically Darker and Edgier Jurassic Park with Ian Malcolm limping his way in Dr Grant's place. Also the villain is a whiny rich bone-obsessed pissbaby heir to a toy company who's tone is comparable to Dandy Mott or a young Draco Malfoy. ",1.0
"I have read Jurassic Park probably 15 times over the last 20 years and I absolutely love every word. Lex in the book is a younger version of the Lex we see in the movie. I prefer the book version more because she is a more realistic version of a young, spoiled rich girl. The Lex from the movie is whiny and a liability but when Spielberg switched their ages he did a real disservice to the character of Tim.

In the novel Tim is the capable one with all the answers looking after his younger sister. In the movie he is still capable but his abilities seem less real because he is the younger of the two siblings. Don't get me wrong I take any chance I can get to watch the movei and was the only one of my friends or family who saw it when it was re-released in 3D (even though i despise 3D). I was alone in the theater quoting every word... I digress.

Lex is supposed to be whiny and a liability because she is a child and a child, especially at her age, would not understand the consequences of her actions. Spielberg's decision to make her older and less of a liability caters to this delusion in Hollywood that children are just tiny versions of adults. That their brains are fully developed and they can rationalize things and make smart choices. I don't know about you but I have worked with children and even the smartest of kids at that age have trouble rationalizing things.

I went off on that whole thing to finish by saying that they are almost two separate entities for me and each one of them has positives and negatives but in truth I enjoy Lex's character in both for different reasons.",1.0

Memories of some of the death scenes >!in particular, Wu and Hammond!< remain burned into my mind. A book where it's a good toss up as to whether or not the book or the movie is better, and the movie is hella good. I like the themes, and how well Crichton does to have them sort of reinforced by the action, and the procedural puzzle solving moments are very satisfying. Even just typing it out now I'm reminded of how many little things that I remember from it, like Ellen thinking about inappropriate plants.

That said, Ian Malcom.

*Jurassic Park* is the sort of literary equivalent for me of pictures of me as a Juggalo. It's attitude of insufferable intellectual superiority, largely voiced through the patron saint of Redditors everywhere Ian Malcom as he lies on a morphine drip and Author Filibuster on an enormous amount of topics that, now, seem borderline ridiculous, but at the time was the coolest thing ever and who I wanted to be. There's a lot of old science fiction that has bad science in it that feels excusable, but with *Jurassic Park*, it's the worst because of how much it doubles down on that sort of thing as part of a quasi-political but definitely moralistic message. And just Not Okay because it binds it up in sort of rhetoric about science and reason that would come to dominate argumentation, all 'facts don't care about your feelings' and what not. And I feel particularly bummed out about that sort of thing, which makes it hard even as a guilty read.

I feell like Chricton thinks he's smarter than he is. He thinks his twists and turns are hard to predict or understand, so he writes his characters that way.

Here's the closing para:

*Nearly every one of Ready Player One’s faults is a direct result of Cline’s authorial narcissism. The writing process appears to have begun with the question: What if the entire world revolved around me, and the specific video games and movies I like? The rest was assembled around that essential core. Cline is far from the first author to write a self-insert wish fulfillment narrative, but he may be the first to write one this lazy and self-indulgent. To place oneself in the character of Wade Watts, an 18-year-old video game trivia knower, requires no imagined heroism or personal growth. It simply constructs a world around the reader, where his comfort zone, his passively acquired knowledge of retro video games and Star Wars, is enough to effortlessly make him a Great Man of History. A fantasy this mundane is barely a fantasy at all — just a desire to be unjustly rewarded for mediocrity. And, thanks to Steven Spielberg, Cline’s mediocrity has been rewarded beyond his wildest dreams.*",0.0
"It’s weird, I enjoyed Ready Player One for what it was, it’s not a well written book but the references kind of had purpose - they’re all related to the plot, things that can help uncover the secrets of the Easter Egg by  Halliday. It’s written in as his favourite things and it’s a huge part of the world, so naturally everyone is obsessed about solving it and develop obsessions over pop culture as a result. It’s not great writing, but it had purpose and was entertaining for me. I enjoyed the idea of it all.

Ready Player Two, on the other hand, was a steaming pile of shit, that had triple the pop culture references with no purpose or need to them. It was Cline stoking his own ego. It was utterly horse shit, and genuinely painful to read. Every character would hi-five, fist bump, dance randomly and “level a finger” all the time and it was just bad.

"It's books like Ready Player One that make me less upset at the author and story and more upset that we live in a world in which it did well. This book is the kind of self-indulgent hero fantasy that someone would write, putting themselves in the middle of a world completely suited to their interests and have them come out on top as it is designed specifically for them. Where the real problem is is that modern culture has become so obsessed with this consumer-driven era of the past and detached from reality that they will see themselves in this hero worship story. Wade Watts beats a level by knowing every line of the Holy Grail? I know ever line of the Holy Grail! That's why RPO is honestly kind of a perfect book for this modern era, it came out right when we as a society were at the height of this 80s nostalgia and when all of this media was readily made available at everyone's fingertips all of the time. You ask why people in the 2040s would be obsessed with John Hughes instead of fixing the famine problem? Why did we just have a whole generation of people argue that ""they ruined my childhood"" when another money grabbing sequel is made rather than care about climate change or poverty? They are obsessed with the same hero worship that Cline is and that he provided them in this book, giving them a world in which caring about all this stuff actually pays off instead of being a meaningless obsession.",0.0

"I haven't finished the entire trilogy, but I have gotten past the first two books. I'm mostly favorable to the first book, *The Maze Runner* itself , and fairly neutral about the second book, *The Scorch Trials*. As for my review below, I hope I've kept it spoiler free for someone who has seen the movie trailers.



**Review**

I think the concept of the book is fairly brilliant. A group of older kids set up an entire society in this region called the glade,  in the middle of a large and seemingly impossible to solve maze. The way these kids handled everything - from managing food, to sanitation, to the maze runners who hunt for a way out of the maze - was well-established, and had a bit of anti-*Lord of the Flies* flair that I particularly liked.

The book itself was very fast-paced, and was very don't-put-it-down-until-it's-done like Dashner is fond of cliff-hangers that seem important but usually aren't, and while I was occasionally annoyed that almost every chapter seemed to have an almost melodramatic final few words, it did keep me reading the book and finishing it quickly. If I'm motivated to read a book as fast as I did *The Maze Runner*, then I'm more than willing to recommend it.


The issue, and I think this is where the not-so-happy reviews come from, is with the main characters, particularly Thomas the protagonist and the mysterious girl, Theresa. They're a bit boring. Thomas shows up to this glade of dozens of teens, and is abnormal and atypical, and sort of popular, without much explanation why except for the fact that he's that one special hero that we often see in the dystopian teen novel genre (plus a couple spoiler-related reasons that I thought were just entirely silly). I think he was a little too sulky and broody about his circumstances at the start of the novel, but considering he's confused and his memories are screwed up, I mostly glossed over that issue. Theresa didn't do much. At all.

So, I didn't like the heroes much, thought a couple things were just goofy, and was a bit annoyed with how most of the moral dilemma questions were solved by having the wrong/bad guy killed off.

I think, from what I've seen of the trailer, the movie may have the potential to be put together better than the book. Thomas seems potentially more likable, my favorite characters are better than I imagined, and the monster creatures - grievers - look pretty darn cool, much cooler than their descriptions in the books. There are some scenes in the trailer that didn't happen in the book, but they look interesting, so I'm more than willing to accept some deviation.



**TLDR;** The plot was cool, the maze itself was cool, the main characters were boring, and some of the climax was a letdown. But, it's still a fun, action-packed read that I certainly recommend.

If you want me to expand more on a certain... anything, let me know.

"The Maze Runner is my favorite book series for young adults! I personally love The Death Cure the most; I read the entire book in a day which is a huge deal for me (it usually takes me a month to get through a book that size due to schoolwork and other activities). 
The character development was fantastic, I cried whenever a character died (not going to say who in case no one has read them all). I think Newt was my favorite, or Minho. 

The prequel that was just released this summer, The Kill Order, was also very good! The story was so addicting, I could barely put the book down. The way that one ended was pretty rad, although as soon as Dee Dee was introduced I knew what was up. ",1.0
"I agree with the other comments in this thread. Quick and easy reads, plot line is decent. I'm nearly finished with the death cure.

The Testing was recommended to me and I picked up the first book, I just haven't gotten around to it so I can't give much of an opinion on it.

As has probably been mentioned, it's actually not all that uncommon.

I mostly read genre fiction like fantasy, sci fi, and horror, but once in a while when I feel like jumping into a quick read I pick up a YA novel and I can appreciate them.

(lol)

I saw The Maze Runner movie before I read the book & totally loved it. I was coming from having already seen The Hunger Games (I was unimpressed but I read the book series anyway since it was becoming so popular & liked it well enough) & Divergent (the movie was so terrible I didn't bother reading the series) and I was... basically prepared for really bogged-down slow-paced universe-exposition scenes as well as lengthy, rather boring, special fx scope-shot extravaganzas. 

I tend to think all adaptations fall victim to these two things really easily (with the understandable goals of 1) making sure those who haven't read the books still understand what's going on, and 2) capturing & doing justice to the visual imagery in the books)...

At any rate, the director of Maze Runner, in an MTV interview, talked about why certain things in the book were excised & he kept coming back to: will it keep a thrilling pace? will it be visually *exciting*?

For me, someone who hadn't read the books, I was basically on the edge of my seat the whole time throughout the film. The pacing was perfect for me. *Also* - Wes Ball wasn't going for ""visually *stunning*"" - he was going for ""visually *exciting*."" He wanted to keep people immersed & intense about what was going to happen next plotwise (which he succeeded in doing for me) versus showcasing his visual effects team's prowess with unnecessarily long & languishing shots of the Maze.

I also think Maze Runner was such a great film adaptation because, unlike other YA dystopia stories, the way the universe works is actually just as confusing to the main characters (in the beginning) as it is to the audience. TMR didn't require the film adaptation to be slow as hell in the beginning to explain the ""way things are"" before launching into the plot (like The Hunger Games and Divergent) because, in the Maze Runner, figuring out ""the way things are"" *is* a huge part of the actual plot: almost each and every development is another ""clue"" to figuring out what exactly is going on in this fictional universe. So... that was really cool to watch (and read). :)",1.0

"> the Hunger Games sometimes fails at this, the Maze Runner, Divergent and so on. Interestingly enough, the titles that I just mentioned are mostly young adult novels and apparently, dystopian stories are common in YA books.

The reason these fail is because their authors also seem to have failed at understanding the original history and purpose of dystopian fiction. If you look at the origins of dystopian fiction, it's original purpose was literally to serve as a social critique and especially as a critique of real world social oppression and authoritarianism. In The Time Machine, Wells' focus is on class warfare and oppression of the working class. In The Iron Heel, which was perhaps the first modern dystopian novel, the focus was on a capitalist oligarchy that again brutally oppressed the working class. Even in 1909, Jack London's work continues to contain relevant references to electoral control by the capitalist class, the use of warfare to spread nationalist rhetoric and distract the working class, etc.

Whether it's The Time Machine, The Iron Heel, The Trial, Nineteen Eighty-Four, It Can't Happen Here, A Handmaid's Tale, Parable of the Sower and so on and so forth, these novels are drawing on real world oppression and social issues to form the basic premise and driving force of the novel. With books like Maze Runner of Hunger Games, very little of the content is actually rooted in real world social oppression. Honestly, I had a lot of fun reading Maze Runner as an adult, it was an entertaining series for the most part. But as dystopian or apocalyptic fiction, it was not believable because it was not rooted in real world oppression nor real world issues. Even when it came to back to the ""climate catastrophe"" aspect and the reasons behind government actions, it was incredibly outlandish and made little sense. So that's quite possibly what you're picking up on...the contrast between genuine dystopian fiction that stays true to the original purpose of the genre vs the more recent trend (particularly geared towards teenagers) that is basically just telling the story of rebelling against a vaguely oppressive government that doesn't really act in the same way as real world systemic oppression.",0.0

I cared for every single one of the main group and was looking forward to get to know them... at the start. Yeah Richard is an unreliable narrator, but just because he's boring and suffers from a severe lack of personality it doesn't mean that the rest of the group should therefore all be lifeless and copies of one another.

It's like Donna knew how to write one (1) person and just copy pasted a sort of template among the main characters.

But I 100% understand the feeling. I am obsessed with the works of Carlos Ruiz Zafón, and he passed away in 2020, so no more novels. I buy The Shadow of the Wind for friends and family, I am brushing up on my Spanish to attempt to read him in the original language. And I search in vain for books that will hit me on that level again.",1.0
"This book has a special place in my heart too. I thought The People In the Trees by Hanya Yanagihara and Babel by RF Kuang were similar/had a similar energy, but nothing compares to The Secret History because it came first. It's a real classic.",1.0
I read The Secret History last month and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since then. Nothing I've read since then has hit the same. It had been such a long time since I've had such a captivating reading experience. Definitely one of my favorite books of all time now.,1.0
I referred to The Goldfinch as “The book we expected Donna Tartt to write after The Secret History”.  I really liked it.  It was so much better than that awful book that actually followed The Secret History.,1.0
I once chose the Secret History for my book club and half the ppl hated it and it really made me lose respect for them.,1.0
"A thousand times yes.  I wonder if The Secret History is so much better than her other books because a lot of it was based on Bennington College and the characters were modeled after her friends and acquaintances.  If you think the Goldfinch is a slog, I implore you to avoid The Little Friend.  You may want to check out the podcast, Once Upon a Time at Bennington College.  It is a very gossipy look at Donna and the other literary ""brat pack"" that went to school there.  It's super fun.",1.0
"I loved the Secret History when I first read it in college. The book I read not long after that reminded me of it was ""Special Topics in Calamity Physics"" by Marish Pessl. Similar vibe and setting. Not quite as good as The Secret History, but it helped scratch that itch.",1.0
"I wish it didn't take Donna Tartt 10 years to write each of her novels. A masterpiece takes time to craft, I get it. After reading The Secret History, very few books can measure up it.

Maybe that's the point. As Tartt mentioned in interviews, she tends to read the same books again and again.",1.0
The Secret History is my favorite book. I don’t think I will ever experience a book like it ever again.,1.0
I always felt like The Secret History was a rip off of Bret Easton Ellis.,0.0
"Donna Tartt is my celebrity crush. No one writes like her! I remember being so perplexed by my tears at the end of The Secret History. Why in the world was I crying for the destruction of these truly horrible people? While on a personal level I much prefer the optimism of The Goldfinch’s finale and its theming, I will always love The Secret History for introducing me to this incredible writer.",1.0

Yes I feel the same way. And now I reread the secret history every second or third year just to get the fix.,1.0

"I loved them both. However, I am from the area where The Little Friend is set, so the descriptions, especially of the heat and the town/homes really does it for me. I was around the same age as Harriet in the same timeframe. I like it so much better than The Goldfinch. The Secret History is her best, though. I’ve probably read it a dozen times. There’s a sub called /r/darkacademia you might like, sometimes there are book suggestions.",1.0

"I enjoyed The Magicians but wouldn’t put it anywhere at the same level of “literary” as The Secret History. It’s an interesting and engaging take on fantasy if you like that sort of thing, but even if it is someone’s jam, you’re not missing out on anything if you just watch the show. One of the few times I actually think the show was better than the book.",1.0
"The focus of the story being much longer in The Goldfinch could definitely make a difference, also the events in the secret history are arguably more exciting as well.
I can't overlook the characters though. Both of the books had settings I loved and a plot I found fascinating but the people were very different. 
Personally, in The Goldfinch I loved everyone so much beginning to end. I agree, Boris really was amazing!
However in The Secret History as I got further into the book some of their personalities began to grate on my nerves and their actions baffled me at times.

And yes I heard the movie was a huge disappointment! I'm always tempted to watch it but I refuse to let myself for fear it'll taint the book for me lol",1.0
"Tana French, The Likeness 

It is different than the secret history because it's from the perspective of a detective, but the friend group has very similar vibes. I love secret history and the likeness I think gives a little taste of it!",1.0
"I read this only after reading The Goldfinch. After being taken in by the way she writes, I read all of her other books. The Goldfinch is my favorite, but The Secret History is a VERY close second. Such a well told story, and it felt like I was there, watching every page as it happened. Loved it.",1.0

Beautifully written and nearly impossible to put down. I'm currently searching for a signed limited edition as a gift for my wife. I'm horrible at picking gifts, but I think this would be a good one.",1.0
"You should give The Secret History a go. Everyone is loathsome but somehow you still want to be in their secret little club. She creates this wonderful atmosphere of academia. Tartt's prose is amazing (as it was in The Goldfinch, it was the only thing that got me through the Vegas part).",1.0
I centainly preferred the Secret History over the Goldfinch. I enjoyed much of the Goldfinch but in the end I found it incoherent and I was annoyed by being force fed a lesson on how to live life. It's a page turner though.,1.0
The Goldfinch is mind-blowing but now I'm excited to read The Secret History!,1.0
"This is my experience as well. I loved The Goldfinch, and recently listened to The Secret History (narrated by Tartt herself), and I absolutely loathed it. I have to believe that to some degree, the narration impacted that, which is why I mention that I listened to it rather than read it. Tartt is not a good narrator, and this was a poor choice on her part.",0.0

"I loved The Little Friend but, find the Secret History to be her best!",1.0
"To be fair, I think the story of The Secret History is much better than The Goldfinch and would likely make a better, more interesting film for audiences.",1.0
"I really don’t understand that opinion especially since the narrator in the secret history was unreliable and arguably very unlikeable. 100’s of pages of exposition detailing Richard’s every movement got incredibly boring and stale by the end of the book.  

I think some people tend to like flowery and descriptive writing and some prefer a more fleshed out plot. Different stokes for different folks is right",0.0
"I read this book years ago before TikTok was even dreamt of, thank God, and it was a better experience for it. Like, it gets lumped in with ""dark academia"" but all dark academia seems to be is books written for or by people who liked The Secret History. I don't think this ""genre"" (which I don't think it can be called) would exist without TSH. Which is why it rubs me the wrong way to talk about the ""aesthetic"" of TSH. TSH is not about any aesthetic, which I think sets it apart from others it gets compared to. I love it so much and I want to reread it but man I get tired of how it's spoken about these days.",1.0
"If you want a similar vibe of pretentious liberal arts students and murder I really liked “If We Were Villains” it doesn’t have quite the same level of depth as The Secret History but I really enjoyed it.

Bunny and Ninth House are also in university settings. Bunny is a wild ride that I love with all my heart.",1.0
"The podcast is so good. Such a great accompaniment to the Secret History, and now I love to read Ellis and Letham",1.0
"i love your take on Dark Academia. Honestly on tumblr and other places on internet, i mostly see people just romanticize the genre / the aesthetic of it. But Donna Tart not only portrayed the academia endearingly but also criticized its phony harshly. As a poor snob who sometimes feels out of place, i relate to Richard. The secret history a great satire. I will check out the podcast. Thank you!",1.0
"I loved it too!  I'm reading The Goldfinch right now and I'm enjoying that a lot too.

I read The Secret History last year and it's on my list of top 10 favorite books of all time. I used to be a big Bret Easton Ellis fan so no surprise there I guess.",1.0
"Ahh our weekly ‘The Secret History’ post. To be the voice of dissent, the book starts okay then totally falls apart in the second half. Charles character makes absolutely no sense. Richard suddenly describing the urge to rape someone??? Ohh incest too, how very Greek! This is likely the most hyped book on the internet, and outside of Bunny, there is zero character development. They’re all just angsty cigarette puffing weirdos. What I find most hilarious is Tartt’s seeming inability to write women, she makes Saul Bellow and Phillip Roth look like Charlotte Brontë . It’s like Tartt watched a Whit Stillman movie, read Crime and Punishment, then decided to write an adaptation with the surroundings of her adolescence. At least the prose is a delight.",0.0
the secret history is one of my favorite novels for all the reasons you just described. i LOVED the first 2/3s of the goldfinch (the opening is gripping & theo’s hardscrabble life in suburban las vegas fits a lot of the self-loathing awkward notes i love about the secret history). cannot for the life of me get through the first chapter of the little friend! you just convinced me to move it to my donate pile.,1.0

"Yah I’m obsessed with that book too. Kind of funny it’s dedicated to Bret Easton Ellis as I can’t read his stuff and it hasn’t aged well imo, but The Secret History omg is like a fine wine 🤌💖",1.0
So wonderful. The only downside is I've never enjoyed a book by her since cos they're not funny and mysterious like The Secret History.,1.0
"The Secret History is one of my favorite books. So much so, that I cried when my husband gifted me a 1st edition hardcover copy lol.

I reread it every now and then and it is so enthralling every time. Since you liked it, you should check out *If We Were Villains* by M. L. Rio. The writing isn't as strong as Tartt's (she's just one another level, prose-wise), but it's a similar ""me and my group of friends covered up the murder of our friend"" story, but it's theater kids instead of Classics kids.",1.0
Actually studied The Secret History in a modern fiction course when I was in varsity. We looked at it as a reception analysis of Greek mythology. Was not expecting to be as good as it was. Pretty much immediately went and read The Little Friend and The Goldfinch.,1.0

"i have. it's a far cry from the secret history. i loved it nonetheless. it's more in line with tartt's dickensian style of narration. the plot is really bleak and gloomy as most of dicken's are and the pov is a young girl probably resembling donna herself. unfortunately it was marketed the wrong way, that is, the murder mystery label on it wasn't the right choice cause... well, you never get any answer for the murder happening in the first page. it's just a gloomy, dark, gothic sourthern atmosphere where characters and settings are studied with so much care, almost ad nauseam. although it seems the murder is the throughline and steady point of the story, it's just about the disillusionment of a child by her inability to find her brother's murderer. it's a bildungsroman. it's a bleak house. it's an oliver twist.",1.0
"I agree. I just finished reading The Goldfinch and really didn't like it all that well, but on the other hand I completely loved The Secret History.",1.0
I’ve read both the secret history and the goldfinch and I adored them both. How is the little friend?,1.0

If you enjoyed Neil, one of the main characters, there is an audio of him reading the abridged version of the secret history on YouTube. It is quite pleasant",1.0
"My second favourite behind *The Secret History*, is *The Red Word* by Sarah Henestra. It takes on the topics of rape culture in fraternities while still having that dark academia vibe. It's one of the few books I've found to come close to what Donna Tartt does in *The Secret History*.",1.0
"I really enjoy getting to know characters as I read a book. The characters are more important than the plot for me. The Secret History had amazing characters and they were put into situations that really pushed them. For me, it was exciting to see how these people would act in the crazy scenarios.",1.0
"I liked the Goldfinch and didn’t like The Secret History really at all. But yeah, I felt the same way finishing The Secret History.",0.0
The Goldfinch is way better than this one. I was disappointed with The Secret History too.,0.0
"I think that explains it for me! I'm just not able to read books revolving around characters I don't like. I can deal with characters I have complex feelings towards, but none of the characters in TSH were even remotely likable to me, especially though the eyes of the main character. Maybe if it was told by a character who was interesting and had stronger feelings about themselves and the people they're surrounded by... they would've likely tried to make their own actions seem sympathetic regardless of whether or not they actually are... but a boring character idealizing unlikable characters just doesn't really do it for me. 

I read The Goldfinch first and really liked that one, personally. Even the atmospheric vibe of the slow parts in Nevada really appealed to me lmao Have you read The Little Friend? I had grabbed both that one and The Secret History after reading The Goldfinch, but was less eager to read it after not liking TSH.",0.0

You know I've only been able to read 'the secret history' her other books don't particularly appeal to me for some reason... It's just that the book has a certain hazy late summer feel to it...

Update: I finished it and don’t know how to feel. I appreciated the wrap-up aspect of the epilogue, but wow, the ending was so incredibly sad and beautiful. Fitting for the tone of the novel I suppose!",1.0
"I read Goldfinch and The Secret History around the age of 30; and honestly, I'm kind of glad that I did because I think the aesthetic aspects of both novels would have really suckered me as a younger reader.  It's definitely a romanticized recount of college; and I'm sure it would have been incredibly appealing to me while I was in college.  At the very least, it would have encouraged me to smoke more cigarettes.    


As an older reader, I could appreciate the prose and the tale; but ultimately, there were always moments that struck me as rather ridiculous.  I don't think I would have noticed that if I were younger, as I would have been in too much of a rush buying Anne Carson and herringbone skirts.  Now that I'm older, living in almost continuous contact with academics (husband, friends, family--there's a lot of professors in my life), I can clearly see just how fanciful, if not absurd, it all is and appreciate it for what it is:  just another story.",1.0
I read The Secret History after falling in love with The Goldfinch and I loved The Secret History even more. I highly recommend If We Were Villians by M. L. Rio.

So far, i'm loving it! I've read *The Goldfinch* and ended up really liking it, so was looking forward to this one. *The Secret History* seems a little quicker, a little faster paced, more of a page-turner... Still early on, but those're some of my impressions so far!",1.0
"What a good read! I had no idea Tartt and Brett Easton Ellis were alumni of the same college! It's nice to know The Secret History was drawn from her own experiences.

The Secret History is one of my favourite books. Especially, as the OP mentions, how the main characters that we found sympathetic turn out to be, perhaps, the opposite of what they seem.

If you liked The Secret History, I would definitely recommend the Goldfinch. Thought I have to admit that I thought the ending could use some more resolution, I was left unsatisfied.

Her third book, The Little Friend, is also well worth reading. The strong-willed young girl who is the main character is unforgettable. Though there is an unsolved mystery that frustrated me. Unless people that have read it think it's obvious, but it wasn't to me. Of course, the unsolved mystery is realistic, not everything in life has a solution.",1.0

That is what I love about her writing. No one is bland good or bad. They all are on a spectrum of grey somewhere in between.

"Like everyone else here said, although there are similar themes between the two, The Secret History is more developed, more thorough, and overall a denser book. If We Were Villains doesn’t measure up by those metrics, but I personally had more fun reading it.",1.0
"I personally enjoyed both a lot. Upon first reading, I thought I liked IWWV better, but as time passed, I found that I more often think of The Secret History and remember it more fondly, especially when it comes to prose.  


In terms of why people often compare the two- the atmosphere, setting, main themes (obsession, murder...) and even the cast of characters, a tiny bit, are very similar. I wouldn't call IWWV a modernized version of TSH necessarily, but there's no doubt in my mind that it has been heavily inspired by it. The writing is very different, though.  


I definitely would suggest you give IWWV a chance, it was fairly immersive and had a great cast of characters.",1.0

"wow, so opposite. god the first few pages are so dull and drudge. I too love an unreliable narrator, but this one just had the life sucked out of him from the very beginning...

if you want a gripping first few pages, hell, gripping from the very first line with unlikeable characters, read Rebecca.

I'm really starting to wonder what people see in this book (The Secret History) and where they're coming from because atmospheric writing is not enough to keep me engaged for over 500 pages much less five. And with the attention span of today's society, I would venture to say that's probably also the case for most. So I'm deducing there is a deeper underlying reason why people like this book other than the ""atmospheric writing"" that people are purporting is the reason. I read an astute observation somewhere that people who like this book either miss the point entirely, or want to be a part of that lifestyle or both...

which doesn't say much other than: they're basic. no offense or anything. I'm just appalled at how much I find myself thinking: ""wow I literally don't care."" so many times throughout this first chapter. and genuinely wondering what the appeal is other than, other people must be living in such a drudge way as well to find this remotely interesting or fascinating in any way...
