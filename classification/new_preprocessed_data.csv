0,I feel like much much better version Maze Runner premier Ender Game - sending kids elaborate training ground . It helps Card actually explains 're . Dashner made generic post-apocalyptic story . ,0
1,"Totally agree . Ender game one best scifi books kids main characters . They n't put kids type danger The Maze Runner , believable . There actual consequences actions , better character development Ender Game , especially later books . ",1
2,"The Maze Runner trilogy left wholly dissatisfied end . Everything set terrible anticlimactic payoff Death Cure imo . > ! Chuck ’ family , Thomas Teresa ’ relationship , cure Flare , Vince opposition ! < . It also ended confusing moral message > ! destroying Denver , dooming rest humanity die , proving WICKED truly ugly necessary thing trying kill Thomas cure . The writer also failed properly develop Teresa forced nobody Brenda Thomas . ! < It felt rushed didnt payoff anything properly imo . I think Maze Runner truly great one unique storytelling device > ! starting amnesiac Thomas , thrust foreign environment , insane amount tension dealing Grievers learning Griever Hole ! < . However , series progressed , became obvious Thomas plot armor . I think Scorch Trials good mystery atmosphere . They ’ travelling foreign , hostile landscape making events Maze Runner . After payoffs spoiled Death Cure , I ’ enjoy I know literally goes nowhere . ",0
3,"book good I finish hunger game . Their good books , wish The Maze Runner world sound look good head author n't much . ",1
4,"James Dashner idea guy , fails miserably execution . His style writing juvenile ; feels like ’ talking readers way . I powered The Maze Runner series back 2013 I excited Dylan O ’ Brien getting lead role movie series . ",0
5,"I saw movie I read book . My sister opposite . I absolutely hated book felt like movie made characters much relatable book . I decided read next two series say IMO , real step first book . Scorch Trials I think best three . The writing fantastic , I enjoy story line enough I get past . I think adapted Maze Runner book fantastic screenplay I think actors definitely suited characters . I looking forward seeing Scorch Trials goes comes September . I think worth reading next two over-arching plot excellent , writing gets way . Just two cents : ) ",0
6,The Maze Runner Series . Read first book found pretty cool interesting every book felt like collection fever dream video game rolled one . Between random challenges story tangents whole twist ending felt like writer kept changing mind take story never deleted old content . And n't even get started prequels ! Both books couple hundred pages took literal months read get reason even reading main series decided end . I sit force get chapter chapter like child taking medicine . ,0
7,"I read first Hunger Games loved , kind fell Mockingjay . I guess felt like kind started lull I lost interest . I plan go back finish though . The Maze Runner series far snowballing intensity . There n't moment yet I felt like I reading part get back action . For consistently entertaining every single word . And super easy read . Have n't read Divergent . ",1
8,I loved Divergent series Maze Runner series . I feel like Divergent almost ( dare I say ) twilight lot story based young love Maze Runner much less . Maze Runner action & mystery . ,1
13,"To quite honest , I read first three trilogy could n't finish prequel . Without spoiling story , find ending Maze Runner bit might expecting . The rest story , , seemed like layer upon layer plot twists plot twists undoing others actually times I frustrated things unfolded . I would suggest least try original trilogy , especially depending like first 75 % Maze Runner . Though ending may make go lolwut ? The prequel really , really sucked . I read 33 % dumped . ",0
14,I started fourth book today . At point I reading completion . I read The Maze Runner I really enjoyed . The ending leaves cliff hanger I honestly content stopping I heard rest books n't good . Well girlfriend convinced read rest series feels like chore . Sure parts suck keep turning page sudden something else thrown characters I like seriously ? How much longer drag ? ,0
15,I read Maze Runner Wiki read rest . I glad I would massive waste time . ,0

19,"I enjoyed Maze Runner books , ended I n't ready let go I read prequel . It takes place world different characters . I would recommend reading still unanswered questions . ",1
20,I read book The Maze Runner series prequel definitely least favorite . It slow seemingly pointless I could get book skimming . I would n't recommend reading . ,0
24,"http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kill_Order This ? To clear , I n't read books . When I saw trailer The Maze Runner , I suspected going YA bullshit would able get long kept things mysterious never revealed really going . Lo behold , I feel I correct , first book n't really reveal anything larger story . Once get like halfway second book , find really going , IMO , pretty stupid . It seems like kind thing even middle schoolers would read say Dude , really ? ",0
25,"I n't finished entire trilogy , I gotten past first two books . I mostly favorable first book , * The Maze Runner * , fairly neutral second book , * The Scorch Trials * . As review , I hope I kept spoiler free someone seen movie trailers . * * Review * * I think concept book fairly brilliant . A group older kids set entire society region called glade , middle large seemingly impossible solve maze . The way kids handled everything - managing food , sanitation , maze runners hunt way maze - well-established , bit anti- * Lord Flies * flair I particularly liked . The book fast-paced , don't-put-it-down-until-it's-done like Dashner fond cliff-hangers seem important usually n't , I occasionally annoyed almost every chapter seemed almost melodramatic final words , keep reading book finishing quickly . If I motivated read book fast I * The Maze Runner * , I willing recommend . The issue , I think not-so-happy reviews come , main characters , particularly Thomas protagonist mysterious girl , Theresa . They 're bit boring . Thomas shows glade dozens teens , abnormal atypical , sort popular , without much explanation except fact one special hero often see dystopian teen novel genre ( plus couple spoiler-related reasons I thought entirely silly ) . I think little sulky broody circumstances start novel , considering confused memories screwed , I mostly glossed issue . Theresa n't much . At . So , I n't like heroes much , thought couple things goofy , bit annoyed moral dilemma questions solved wrong/bad guy killed . I think , I seen trailer , movie may potential put together better book . Thomas seems potentially likable , favorite characters better I imagined , monster creatures - grievers - look pretty darn cool , much cooler descriptions books . There scenes trailer n't happen book , look interesting , I willing accept deviation . * * TLDR ; * * The plot cool , maze cool , main characters boring , climax letdown . But , still fun , action-packed read I certainly recommend . If want expand certain anything , let know . * * Edit * * spelling grammar errors ",1
26,"The Maze Runner one favorite books . It dystopian book , I love . Not , story n't revolve around romance . It many aspects I enjoyed well , two biggest . ",1
27,"The Maze Runner favorite book series young adults ! I personally love The Death Cure ; I read entire book day huge deal ( usually takes month get book size due schoolwork activities ) . The character development fantastic , I cried whenever character died ( going say case one read ) . I think Newt favorite , Minho . The prequel released summer , The Kill Order , also good ! The story addicting , I could barely put book . The way one ended pretty rad , although soon Dee Dee introduced I knew . ",1
28,"I rarely felt knowing spoilers ruined enjoyment book . It journey matters , destination . Though I suppose something like Maze Runner depends surprise . There much else good otherwise . ( Just read last week I enjoyed , I thought incredibly shallow . ) ",0
29,"I agree comments thread . Quick easy reads , plot line decent . I nearly finished death cure . I n't think I going read kill order , I ready move . The price three ebooks price admission movie theater I entertained longer . I little bored maze runner beginning , halfway I started become interested . I think scorch trials exciting three . Just two cents ",0
32,"Oooh YA Dystopia , really big thing years ago . Hunger Games Harry Potter great , two 're considering go The Maze Runner , absolutely loved first book . I want get rest series probably need re-read . The Testing recommended I picked first book , I n't gotten around I ca n't give much opinion . Also check The Giver Red Rising n't already . As probably mentioned , actually uncommon . I 30 children I book blogging consistently 2 years , I tell book bloggers booktubers read almost exclusively YA , 're anywhere range 20 40 . I mostly read genre fiction like fantasy , sci fi , horror , I feel like jumping quick read I pick YA novel I appreciate . Read enjoy reading n't mind people think ! If fun reading YA better reading ! Glad passion books reignited , hey maybe talk son reading . ",1
34,I struggled finish Maze Runner also twist end like ok gets interesting ? ! way hell I going read 2 books . > . < ,0
38,"THE MAZE RUNNER ! I ’ mad direction Dashner took books . The first one amazing , complex , great world building , later books shattered rushed make ending . The series really dwindled . Big disappointment I LOVED first book . ",0
40,"This random know marketing strategy really gets goat ? Attaching first chapter book sequel onto end first book . Drives absolutely bonkers & I always absolutely refuse read 're . They feel like spoilers teasers also like 're devaluing second book : I got read first portion second book first book , reduce cost second book percent pages I got & read first book , damn ! ( lol ) I saw The Maze Runner movie I read book & totally loved . I coming already seen The Hunger Games ( I unimpressed I read book series anyway since becoming popular & liked well enough ) & Divergent ( movie terrible I n't bother reading series ) I basically prepared really bogged-down slow-paced universe-exposition scenes well lengthy , rather boring , special fx scope-shot extravaganzas . I tend think adaptations fall victim two things really easily ( understandable goals 1 ) making sure n't read books still understand going , 2 ) capturing & justice visual imagery books ) At rate , director Maze Runner , MTV interview , talked certain things book excised & kept coming back : keep thrilling pace ? visually * exciting * ? For , someone n't read books , I basically edge seat whole time throughout film . The pacing perfect . * Also * - Wes Ball n't going visually * stunning * - going visually * exciting * . He wanted keep people immersed & intense going happen next plotwise ( succeeded ) versus showcasing visual effects team prowess unnecessarily long & languishing shots Maze . I also think Maze Runner great film adaptation , unlike YA dystopia stories , way universe works actually confusing main characters ( beginning ) audience . TMR n't require film adaptation slow hell beginning explain way things launching plot ( like The Hunger Games Divergent ) , Maze Runner , figuring way things * * huge part actual plot : almost every development another clue figuring exactly going fictional universe . So really cool watch ( read ) . : ) ",1

50,"The Hunger Games left bitter fucking taste mouth . Like shit - rolled shit - cooked oven made shit . Ok , I really hated The Hunger Games . But I could n't ignore The Uglies . The premise sounded really interesting , many people saying good things . But I never went intention reading first one . A lot books initial idea run , ( The Hunger Games , The Maze The Maze Runner ) idea gets spread thin , next books weaken . Combine distaste The Hunger Games - similar two - belief main character girl feed Katniss Everdeen cake success , I n't interested reading beyond initial concept . And though idea good , parts book OK , execution mostly lacking . Ok , I suppose unfair . I n't go book cynically - I wanted find , explore interesting sounding premise , see worth hype . If really good I would read rest , book meh . ",0
53,"My daughter says Maze Runner trilogy better Hunger Games , I n't read . I thought Hunger Games great book ; trilogy altogether good first book . Have n't heard Chaos Walking , looks like daughter new series start . Thanks : ) ",1
54,You read . The Hunger Games good action filled book . I felt 2 like 1 3 OK . But worth reading . Nice easy reads . But Chaos Walking excellent well thought novels . Each character novel brings something new trilogy . I checking Maze Runner Trilogy . ( btw long time since I YA ! ! ) ,1
56,"I read Dune I 15 ( I almost 50 ) shaped life . It far favorite re-read series books . It taught skeptical religion politics always try understand motives history behind people believe believe . The important life lesson though came quote And always , fought temptation choose clear , safe course , warning 'That path leads ever stagnation ' . I tried hard get complacent life . And always make hard choices lead growth change , instead easy/less effort . ",1

59,"I ’ reading dune messiah first time right . Super good bit different first Dune . It amazes much power plot jammed 300 pages . When example Game Thrones ( I ’ read ) 1000 page books still amazing story , different story telling methods . ",1
60,"Hi ! It great hear book impact . I reading studying 20+ years still find new things every time . The rest series kicks butt fills lot meaning happened Dune . Of points disappoint , funny , Frank went way show Dune story usual flow stories . Paul n't someone leading people freedom ; someone realizes destined , struggles * whether * . And time goes less choice , especially begins adopt mentality ' winner ' , requires acting mourning later . Both death father son given almost time , * ca n't afford take time * . We see POV , effect . And I think sad think Paul ca n't afford sad give things time . The ending also comes close quite quickly without much pomp , although may feel like almost lacks denouement , effect meant show unfinished story ; meant understand one specific turning point came . And I think lacks pomp Paul POV ending story failure , victory . He * fails stop * coming Jihad served purpose much stay path would lead . Viewed failure ending makes sense lack certain 'triumphant happy ending ' feel . Even Chani n't exactly happy ending , learning fate royal concubine . There lot mythology ; story someone knows trapped mythology assesses possible ways avoid , seem even worse . ",1

66,"For anything Dune triumph world building . Not create vast story stretching 40,000 years ( something like ) , makes believable realistic . ",1
69,"In humble opinion Frank Herbert n't great writer ( n't bad means ) , masterful worldbuilder . He created deeply complex thoughtful scifi world really n't ever matched . I think fair say Dune fairly underwhelming prose really , Dune , atleast , story sum parts . It book got thinking ecology , destiny even inherent strangeness far future . There really sci-fi . ",1

This especially apparent scenes The Barron . That writing style appeals first second person even first person limited like Harry Potter . It bound hard readers , jumping characters often , I feel like Dune good job using italics highlight character thoughts . That alone would probably make turning book extremely hard project . How convey movie viewer internal thoughts . There ways definitely present problem director . ",1

493,Do favor stop Children Dune . ,0
495,"The first book hardest , damn incredible . I read God Emperor ( 4th book ) would recommend go least far . Without spoilers : book 2 different pace 1 . It noticeably different feel . To use ASOIAF analogy difference Robert rebellion game thrones ( aka book 1 ) . It bad book comparing messiah children , emperor , Dune , probably weakest . That said , children god emperor almost incredible first book transpires messiah crucial others fair bit world building . Children well done thrilled n't stop earlier . When I finished children , started god emperor , I ended going back rereading Dune , events messiah children , well premise God Emperor , made want check dune foreshadowing etc . And boy It disappoint . ( One last note Messiah : consider different tone Star Wars A New Hope Empire Strikes Back . One ends Luke blowing death star , next ends Han frozen Luke getting proverbial bomb dropped . ) But aside , Dune absolutely incredible , rare case everyone calls classic exaggerating . The amount modern media finds root astounding . Clearly star wars would n't exist without , glaring comparison . A song ice fire ( faceless men medieval face dancers , guys n't detailed book 1 iirc ) , even butlerian jihad likely inspired fair bit matrix . It hard start making connections . But perhaps got series , depiction bene gesserit . They talk seeding planets myths savior coming stars , child weirding woman , something kind emergency survival mechanism anyone need . The BG revealed shrewd , calculating , manipulative . It paint favorable picture organized religion way works fiction accomplish , even Paul worrying duel regardless outcome , worshipped god jihad run name . If wins one stop ! If loses great martyr sacrificed us ! Also , thoughts reading ungodly difficult translate screen ? All visions , hand signals , etc . I n't think impossible good hell people lot plates 😆 look like 're ok casting far ",1
496,"I bought copy Dune couple years ago still sitting shelf . I mean pick year , however . Ca n't wait read ! ",1
497,"First Dune book northing short amazing , one fav books time . The series gets progressively worse - imo ended first book , perfect ending . That said , I enjoyed 2nd book , although nearly much first . The 3rd book disappointing . So I think pre-conceived notions Dune series spot . ",1
498,"I honestly feel like everybody overhypes Dune waay much . I ’ read , frankly ’ tell thing happened main character led jihad universe . Boring , pointlessly convoluted outdated . Feel way lord rings though . Was able slog , tried pick quit . But hey , kudos finding something like ! Hope ’ enjoy rest : ) ",0

501,"I question . I wanted read dune , mostly due weekly I read dune , wow ! Posts , I ca n't get . I love sci-fi fantasy movies/games , every time I try READ sci-fi ( starting dune ) I feel like I absorbing words without real direction . Let try explain .. This non-spoiler , I n't get past 30 pages deep . ___ Sci-fi trope over-complicating things/names/terminology/descriptions reason . Even rereading paragraph multiple times combat inevitable dude ? What ( insert unrelatable sci-fi term ) ? , I still fall short . There dope scene kid ( name I ca n't recall , story made sense ) put hand box thing impossible imagine . I really tried , I could imagine cube Looney tunes hole one side . The kid puts hand .. test ? That random lady showed day administered . It obvious n't actually harming , chosen one something , spent multiple pages talking describing affected hand overly convoluted ways . In short , box simulated pain , handle pain , 're special . Question time : ( really looking answers specifically , I displaying questions get frame reference I n't understand , hopefully I figure I n't understand ) ___ Who lady ? The book says nothing comes mind . Dude I n't remember even got kids place . The first thing I remember scene peaking room talking mom . Again , said , old lady flew spaceship , I remember . So something like happened , I could assume overly complicated scene made concentrated things picturing story whyyyyy . Do I selective reading I remember inessential details ? Because surely useful , dumb brain . Why lady even ? How learn boy ? She knows mom somehow , maybe Facebook idk What hell house look like ? Leaving create entire artificial scene head whilst spending paragraphs describing little cube like tying shoes together starting race . And even I get finish line , shoes still tied took forever get 10 yard line , n't enjoyable . Like .. someone help untie shoes I run freely marathon ? I n't think telling characters motives going fix anything , I looking answer lack comprehensive reading outside read . It like looking art finished forced attempt describe without ever seeing . A book paint picture , use imagine canvas . Oh , cube scene , new characters new chapter unmemorable names unimaginable dialogue scene I could n't picture . I think maybe globe ? Fuck 2 a.m . I wish I could read dune enjoy like everyone else . ",0

554,"I actually feel way LOTR books- I liked writing dragged long I never finished series . Weirdly enough , Dune definitely long-winded early chapters I kept putting book like “ ok .... shit popping ? ” But middle book I dragged world-building political intrigue tension lack action ’ really bother .

Each book series particular theme tone , n't expect go . But , really want Dune universe , try books written Frank son Brian Herbert Kevin J Anderson . Those best read order published - Houses trilogy ( histories main characters book 1 ) , Jihad trilogy ( ancient history world ) , two-part finale main series . There I n't bothered .

It considered likely woman possessed spirits dead ancestors acting willed . Sure , maybe narrative correct , contextual assumption insane . The concept womanly autonomy implicitly refuted many ways IIRC explicitly mentioned twice least . The contrary idea , male savior provide autonomous , truly free , act pure creation achievable true , male god-post-human , literally central theme trilogy . It inescapable . If missed , go reread .

745,"n't finished book yet , Frank herberts criticism audience getting Paul morally gray character rather good guy something Denis trying get across films . In second movie small looks perspectives get Paul mother chani subtle changes yet brings message home regarding Paul character . In interview Denis said trying hardest get Franks message across staying true book honestly I n't think could done better - All say I think I prefer movie ( Dune 2 ) since soooo well made . ",0
746,"The world building book better compared film , I must say Villeneuve great job showcasing Herbert written . Of course like book film adaptation , everything accurate , case I say quite point . In Dune II , Chani character n't compared novel . The importance water n't really depicted either . A lot people might disagree I think watching movie reading book might actually give pass . When I first read Dune , I lost . I watched first movie , re-read book made much easier understand every character , culture , politics history Dune . Edit : I also like mention Jessica portrayed film n't books either . Princess Irulan way better film compared reading excerpts first book Messiah . If read Messiah , see Irulan voice book ( I 70 pages , far great ) . Paul n't meant hero , complete opposite . I curious Denis Villeneuve bring character Chani next film . ",1
747,"For positives , ’ telling erase “ fight spice Dune fight oil Middle East ” parallel 2024 . If nothing else , new films leave bad taste mouth . That cowardly . ",0
748,"I love movies , book much better . So much actual story takes place either characters ' thoughts , scenes director decided omit . The romance also took different turn movie , I assume made based around social reasons , totally ignoring actual reason things happened original book . Also , Dune : Messiah story works based lot things changed/left , I sure plans third part , Villeneuve said wanted . ",1
749,"Dune model adapt books . I still prefer book film , way hell adapt book faithfully film . One thing I like film Harkonnens looking inhuman industrial evil worked itseway DNA . ",1
751,"The book better mainly world-building inner monologues missing movie . But movies excellent , even necessary changes excellent adaptation probably ever see without 10 part mini-series insane studio busting budget production quality movies . Ca n't wait Dune Part 2 home release . Saw theater cost $ 50 ( 2 ) see IMAX . Movie prices stupid anymore . Check /r/dune want depth discussion book ( ) movies . ",1
752,"The book better must treat standalones . But , view , book film significantly better combo either would . I adore Dune book , prose style made hard really picture lot head . The film solves problem - Villeneuve vision artistic style ( soundtrack/sound design ! ) amazingly rich vibrant feel like * match * themes ideas well . When I reread book first film , Villeneuve vision I pictured , wonderful . Meanwhile , film necessity must cut rework lot made book deeply engaging . A lot themes ideas characters get lost wayside . By reading book well , takes may loved movie adds dozen layers depth . That wonderful thing . You really get feast mind soul combining strengths enjoying complementary works . The last series I think I felt applied magical whimsy early Harry Potter books/films ( dont @ , I aware issues Harry Potter/JK Rowling . ) ",1
753,"I love book . The director fantastic job bringing Dune universe alive making intriguing , I think limited medium , film , add creative direction limit certain information slightly change parts story make better film . Fantastic movie , reason I prefer book movie massive immersive book feels feels like imagination working alongside guided Frank Herbert . I ’ sure people also feel way movies , I completely biased I prefer books movies general I also love Dune book double biased lol . ",1
754,"Just finished reading Dune well . I like letting book best , building world characters . Movies best visualizing story , bringing characters life special way . ",1
755,"I one like book I read years ago . So , decided pick next one series decided wait movies . I enjoyed DUNE movies well visually . But something I would go back multiple viewings . I n't connect DUNE story . ",0
757,"I loved ‘ 84 Dune movie , I love Villeneuve Dune movies , I still think end day , Dune unfilmable . ",1
758,The book . Far away . I saw Dune Part 2 yesterday thought sucked taking movie merits even worse adaptation . The best adaptation book still Spicedriver fan edit 1984 movie though could much material . I thankful already good adaptation Dune Messiah Children Dune . ,1
760,"I liked book better . With said , I loved movie thought Villeneuve changes really smart . ( Everything pruning characters plots , giving nuance Freemen via believers skeptics , Chani agency , evil Jessica . ) All things added lot story , IMO , allowed translate screen really beautiful way . I n't think I ever able like movie ( I book person I always soft spot Dune ) . But I think Villeneuve tremendous job . ",1
761,"I ’ reading Dune recently well , I ’ get decided move . While world-building interesting people said , prose boring elementary I would rather challenged something else ",0
763,"Yeah I think right thinking . I watched movies partner filling characters motivations , key themes book , really ’ come movies . Things like Paul locked destiny essentially touching Arrakis , potency predictive ability , Fremen followed ( religious hysteria , almost omniscient , getting weird visions ) etc . I ’ little disappointed ’ focus quite much terraforming aspect book , I really loved well . I guess ’ exciting movies , lengths , sacrifices , wins Fremen slowly transforming Dune paradise beautifully rendered book . I think would needed series introduce harsh planet actually , therefore incredible Fremen . ",1
766,"I agree , I really happy handled Paul Dune 2 I really loved ending film chose . Chani realisation Paul using Fremen brilliant . ",1
768,"Chani solves cinematic problem over-narration , something Lynch struggled first adaptation . In order rid unnecessary inner monologue works well books tedious film , serves dual purpose viewer understands conflict Paul ’ position , decisions , etc . That ’ conflict Chani ’ ’ ultimately matter piece cinema . This one reason I find comparisons books films pointless . They entirely different mediums frankly , “ faithful ” adaptation Dune would never actually work ( although graphic novels come close ) , , ultimately , Lynch film failed , Villeneuve film succeeds — Villeneuve less interested remaking novel interested cinematic experience ( visual sonic ) , attempts ( succeeds imho ) get heart Herbert ’ world .

769,"As others thread said , Bene Gesserit books trained complete control bodies emotions even ability control others . The Lady Jessica got movies ( especially part 1 ) felt incredibly weak powerless compared character book . They may done character arc movies portrayal disappointing . I understand ’ possible include every detail book movie adaptation , especially one detail-heavy Dune ! In post I trying communicate I enjoyed extra details book ’ find cumbersome unnecessary like OP - opinion , I understand may everyone . ",1
770,The costuming abysmal hats version dune . It great - faithful - adaptation story costume design budget really lets . ,0
775,"Yeah I agree . When I read Dune first time clear Paul figure celebrated . Enough people thought otherwise Frank wrote Dune Messiah make message absolutely clear . Denis Villeneuve decided make changes service Herbert original vision . He know would chance adapt Messiah wanted sure message came across movies . Chanis role Dune 2 makes absolutely clear Paul hero . There many changes book I like , I think ruined Kynes Jessicas characters removing certain subplots example . But changes Chani I absolutely get behind , adds element tragedy relationship I think works well universe . ",1
776,I would make argument story fleshed refer sources like appendices indexes know ’ happening . I never finished Dune first time I attempted read seeing Dune Part 1 everything came together part way Children Dune . ,1
777,"One simple reason , eh ? As suddenly adding two hours runtime save mess Lynch created ? “ Nah. ” This argument tale old time . Lynch apologists want good bad ’ make excuse : He forced condense , production problems , etc . None matters ; heart ’ bad movie . Everything bad I ’ * huge David Lynch fan * way . I ’ seen * Dune * many , many times . I used pretend good I * wanted * good : It Lynch ! But ’ bad . The look bad , style , pacing , editing , acting , SFX , costumes , random characters , . It ’ convoluted mess fact everything crammed breaks surface badness . Lynch said never read book approached , six months later script . Well , shows . The script terrible . If ’ read book ’ way ’ know hell going . 1984 incredible year movies ; particularly science fiction .

Taking understanding support anger plot wipe family away away robs part cultural identity . To think Chani needs oppose Paul every turn agency pretty much clueless . But also fits total rewriting one important aspects Dune . Contary perpetrated movie , Paul evil manipulator . But well movie tells another Story . Ofc . ",1
783,"Dune truly amazing work . The way Herbert blends interstellar politics , theology , philosophy metaphysics together intoxicating . His world building sublime well . A common criticism I authors rely heavily world building grandiose ideas sometimes overwhelm plot characters , making seem almost like afterthought comparison , Herbert delivers exciting plot full political intrigue characters feel unique believable even outlandish bizarre things going around .

802,"Wow ! I thought God Emperor sucked donkey balls . In fact , reaction Dune OP , I expecting great things rest series . Herbert left Dune stand-alone . ",0
803,"At least Book 1 , great job breaking drama ideas book three scales : political universe empire great houses , tumult ecology Arrakis , family ( house Atreides ) displaced , pressured , striving right sinking ship . It uses heavy world building fuel plot instead way around , exploring core story different lenses . I understand world plus third person omniscient narration would lead people view much sci-fi artifice ’ really skilled writing Dune , often tucked around , first glance , appears rote exposition .

806,"I really n't like Children Dune , I forced way second time couple years ago , reasoning adult I might get . Still n't like , I find hardcover copy God Emperor local used book store figured hell , ca n't much unpleasant * Children * . Turns much . I freaking * looooooved * God Emperor . I mean , still clunky Herbert exposition plot connects convenient way serves whatever philosophical idea Herbert wanted Leto II lecturing chapter , maaaan I rarely ever read book * weird . * Leto II rich , complex , captivating , terrible worm-man , Herbert goes full Herbert exploring . I still n't like Children Dune , stopping means miss God Emperor , damn shame . ( You * * stop God Emperor , though . Heretics Chapterhouse moments - usually concerning Leto II , long dead - ultimately , I dunno , bit departure came ? ) ",1
813,"I wish Dune 7 , n't get started retcon Daniel Marty . Still book 6 ends open ended manner I ever experienced , maybe n't even intend 7 .

819,"Messiah probably favorite book series . I get people n't like - I really feel like Herbert stamping feet yelling No , missed point first one ! necessarily bad thing . Giving Paul hundred pages really unpack dramatic irony , end , realize * * wrong - I love works . I rare sequels works retroactively makes first story * better , * opinion . Never go without reading Messiah finishing Dune ",1
822,"Yeah , ’ I feel . Dune great focuses characters , lore story . It ’ simple straightforward , part , get past terminology Frank Herbert created world-building purposes . It ’ Dune Messiah Frank starts waxing philosophical things beyond expertise . He intelligent well-read former journalist speechwriter , never real political scientist , philosopher , sociologist , psychologist , linguist , historian folklorist . Anyway , Frank ’ posturing reached height GEoD . To book unreadable . I love little world-building get , novel exists mainly Frank espouse views various topics . “ Horny Old Worm Yells Sky ” called . Frank reigned philosophizing last two books , needed sent horny jail . ",1
824,Terrible book . Not fit mentioned alongside/compared Dune . ,0
826,"Herbert tendency to….deconstruct heros . He even said Dune cautionary tale charismatic leaders . You forgiven picking till Dune : Messiah Children Dune really becomes clear . Just FYI really liked Paul . I feel like I ’ minority also recommend God Emperor Dune , even exposition philosophy AND last two Frank Herbert books , Hertics Chapterhouse . But last two end unfinished Frank . So ’ want open ending stop God Emperor . His sons books ’ nearly good I feel characterization cash grab unfounded . ",1
829,"My experience Dune pretty similar , devoured book loved every moment . I find interesting bring parts problematic I kind agree sentiment disagree example . The position women reflection feudal empire space theme setting . The problematic part Baron depraved homosexual , homozexualoty part evil . Well might getting carried away , still fantastic character great villain I doubt allusion barons sensuality film . ",1
830,"Dune story nation oppressed people exploited foreign powers , lead boy king trying take back throne n't belong first place , basically capitalising plight religious dogma . Dogma mothers ' Church programmed . The way Paul Jessica use Fremen harsh lesson . Twisting BG preprogrammed dogma Fremen want . Literally portraying Paul kind god extremely jingoistic oppressed class people . It cynical view also realistic historically informed . The book says one must feeling kind myth 're , move within self aware fashion sardonically present people want see . It sounds like sociopathic manipulation . It beyond Christian 'be things people ' , feels like barely concealed exploitation . I always got impression Fremen beliefs ultimately inconsequential Paul Jessica . Just means end . If I drink funky water get army I acquire increased psychic powers whatever ! It win/win . The ends simply reacquisition power . To degree essentially guide running populist revolution back religious fervour , least view one easily happen consequence dominant powers interacting . ",0
831,"Yes , definitely need read next book . I would highly recommend least read first 4 books . God Emperor Dune ; 4th book ; far best series . Real mind blower . ",1
833,"Interestingly , I suspect Dunes portrayal Lady Jessica already significantly progressive many contemporary sci-fi novels . I tried reading Stranger Strange Land Heinlein , well Foundation novels Asimov . The casual sexism pervasive , ranging paternalistic indulgence lesser personality best , women enemy worst . ",1
837,All 6 Dune books masterpieces . They get better better every book deepened time I reread . ,1

Our last president wife playboy bunny essentially confirmed harem chicks side . Meanwhile , Lady Jessica one premiere strong female characters fiction . Smart , competent respectable lot agency . The first time I read story I actually astounded compelling character . To honest I think far interesting protagonist Paul actually , kind generic Stu modern writing standards . ",1
843,Dune Messiah peak Dune . ,1
845,"I admit I massive Dune fan . I read book 5 times went following 3 books , though none come close Dune . The world building excellent , various cultures developed book .

846,"What mean terms would n't fly today ? So I suppose A Handmaid Tale offensive women logic ? No , highlighting inequalities , stereotypes , issues world Herbert builds . And little sacred feminine work . Dune much feminist work ",1
850,As progress realize females ( Bene Gesserit ) one main puppet masters . Their long term plan integral entire Dune series . ,1
852,"If want go deep , podcasts youtube channels chapter chapter read alongs really go deep analysis . Particularly , ComicBookGirl19 youtube really digs power structures influence Bene Gesserit delves really power shifts telling story . Personally , I think first four books wrap saga Golden Path Terrible Purpose . They provide complete arc . The last two books Hey , wanted Dune , go . Worth reading time . But first four books complete experience . ",1

855,"Glad hear liked ! I started reading series first time spring , I 4th one . I fell love world characters ideas first one , carried far , I think sequels , I think good conscience recommend Dune Messiah .

It philosophical palace-intrigue thriller , I liked . I loved Dune , end Messiah moved point I literally tears . After highpoint , Children Dune real letdown . I n't care nearly much two characters , middle book , plot seemed become meander , though plot picked end , become clearer . Characters kind things , little way motivation make actions make sense . Plots within plots within plots fun , motives characterizations protagonists within plots , hidden even reader , makes somewhat frustrating read . After , fourth one started refreshing I cared characters happened children dune , others said , much journal philosophical musings novel . I halfway , I less lost interest . The ideas world still neat , needs plot keep excited wanting learn . Things kind happen , characters spend chapter talking sagely happened , repeats . I think momentum goodwill first two books carried far , sustain long . Who knows though , I may wrong . Plenty people love 6 books , may well one . I think children dune probably know . ",1

958,Very much . Personal freedoms dont exist societies strict social hierarchy . Which theme heart dune nesting story closed society free one think makes highlighting line free easier see . You may disagree . Also think Hurbert studied bit history likely knew spouses aristocracy elevated rank . We see British monarchy Prince Philip never raised King Elizabeth II became Queen . He called queens consort . In Dune concubine used way . When talk ancient Chinese Arab courts sometimes use words royal concubine sometimes consort . The roles pretty similar . Not similar .

Chani powerful man universe infatuated . Leto II Hwi Fish Speakers ( literally powerful army universe ) . You argue presentation hierarchy dystopia , read content books series…women play integral supreme roles power design social orchestrations Dune universe . Herbert regularly worked wife series , ahead time ( possibly time traveler ) . He ’ perfect…as voting record stray comments times would suggest , incredibly intelligent .

Without getting spoilery , protagonist first Dune book fits Messiah archetype T later books start deconstruct idea messiahdom shows horrors come giving religious political power small group .

1378,"To Dune fantasy mostly human mind . The actual story , heroes villains , fantastic futuriness ways get brain start talking . There constant allusions special languages used convey certain ideas , different schools interpreting world . The result series conversations people less inadvertently discuss philosophy futuristic languages , reader gets read everything every sentence causes person conversation think . What would normally massive battle another fantasy book chess match conversation Dune , things said way said important thing . Lives turn dime choice bad word , misused body language . There lots descriptions massive cities , buildings big city could fit inside , 100 meter long sandworms , none bigness actually matters , real action takes place intimate level , much description character said thing implied characters inferred role sentence played chess game . So big bad guns blazing kind scifi/fantasy , much thoughtful , adult , people least attempt solve problems words . And cool language rules Herbert sets really make feel like future talking/language , I think cool . And also subverts lots tropes like hero journey paul prescience etc .

Admittedly , much I expecting something .... , I think tropish lot motifs become today . The whole space feudalism thing intrigue setup felt times bit like galactic ( TV ) Game Thrones , helped I thought fairly one-dimensional Baron villain . But different layers started drape together something clicked . The bits lore implied believable rich world history without hitting head exposition , like references Butlerian Jihad abolition artificial computing , convergence ancient religions cultures reflected etymology terms used characters . Some sets narrative themes , others provide explanation world physics like lack projectile weapons limited space travel . Then , although superficial plot action feels little unremarkable today , I think really way reader explore tension interests politics , economics , social engineering , ecology Bene Gesserit , Mentats , Landsraad Emperor , CHOAM , spacing guild , Arrakis . I guess readers turned middle section , really put teeth , learning Dune Fremen culture , planetary ecology themes , I thought incredibly effective description Paul mastering prescience , sort challenged different ways knowing idea agency .

I see supernatural abilities Dune possible outcome human evolution start focusing limits body/minds/spirit surpass self-limiting beliefs .

The way dumps world meandering world explanations relieving genre many books first chapters read like mansplaining encyclopedias . Also , I think action woven throughout book . If mean outright conflict main enemy , correct , mainly end . However , rhythm throughput book building tension area conflict resulting bit action release tension . The relative amount intensity action relative influenced read . For example , read Ender Game would understandably feel Dune little slow . But finished Les Miserables , sequence reading , feels like fast paced action novel . Another reason I love , feels like blend sci-fi , fantasy , historical fiction jumbled together . ",1

As story , Herbert tell story believable setting help feel drawn . Everything , ecology , politics , economics , culture feels real gets . Plus , shows realistic portrayal messiah figure . One loses control people worship . As Frank said Charismatic leaders come label : Might Hazardous health .

Paul white savior , demagogue book warning . The Fremen noble savages , indigenous custodians land rich precious resource . These ideas charismatic leaders , indigenous rights , wealth disparity , using religion tool control , wars natural resources , relevant today time written , messages book ring true .

1435,"It best , good . I think sets apart deep , well defined philosophy . It theories power ( personal political ) self control , factions long arcs . It characters think terms lifetimes , eons . There defined history universe , seeing hinge point long arc . In opinion , many stories compact . Dune feels like conflicts rivalries rises power never see , get occasional glimpses . There much world . It also happens influence lot tropes , seems better seem dated . You get feeling influenced works others unrefined comparison , see story create facsimile missing depth . ",1
1438,"The settings Dune prompt vivid mental pictures . As book , people envision personal worlds . But Dune way stronger mental pull . Everything happens Dune IS setting .

1444,"I read Dune first time last year , I bewildered people say greatest sci-fi time . It certainly granddaddy science fiction . It archetypal , groundbreaking came . But since ? There much better science fiction ( personal favorite Expanse ) . The first Dune book , taken , predictable by-the-numbers messiah tale little way surprises . And constant onslaught barely-explained foreign words concepts institutions passes world building pretty much indecipherable without frequent trips book glossary . That said , I also read second book , I found * much * interesting first .

1445,"I like Dune LotR , ton good complexity , planet social structure extremely interesting , lot tension every moment hostile world many people kill control spice I also kind think LotR kind victim success foresty world orcs dwarves elves became ingrained culture already lost luster even I read first time ",1
1447,"The complexity , depth , sheer totality Dune world makes favorite . Cool sci-fi , expansive worldbuilding , political intrigue , ecology , religion , philosophy thrown pot left stew clear moralizing soften . Dune multifaceted amazing . ",1
1448,I liked . I think prequels add depth worlds . Legends Dune better main series ,1
1449,"I sure I pick best Sci-Fi novel ever dune definitely top opinion . The reason fairly simple : Sci Fi , genre , examines human condition context society . The technology simply tool allow interesting questions . In Dune , Herbert asks us : What happens universe single entity controls vital resource ? Reflecting back us question posed oil world . Dune suffused questions powerful poignant . No sci-fi asks much answers little . It , reader , discover answers . ",1
1450,"One things I particularly enjoyed entire series lack typical good guy beats bad guy end rides sunset happily ever . Usually novel trump penalty incurred failure , common see one attributes penalty success . Usually hero wins , situations circumstances others made better , rewards success normally hero working towards . With Dune , success penalty , grevious one world within novel ( GEoD least ) . That I think missing sense catharsis . It climactic battle missing , sense protagonist making thing subjectively 'better ' sphere influence . It less heroes kill dragon get dragon treasures heroes kill dragon mountain explodes taking entire village nearby sent heroes first place treasure cursed . Narratives build adding sense weight reader , post climax resolution normally weight lifted reader sense relief . Herbert structure though adds weight slight sense dread instead relief . One things I think lot people really like Dune , comparison novels , different structure written . How much intentional Herbert part much readers nitpicking details well beyond author intent certainly speculative discussion . At time published , really n't anything else like , even since n't lot took themes structure series elevated way fantasy authors done Lord Rings . Lord Rings massive depth detail , kind complexity woven themes Herbert managed juggle . That kind depth though difficult authors replicate ( varying degrees success certainly ) . Seamlessly interweaving complex themes time developing narrative constructs deconstructs trope trope something many authors even attempt nevertheless succeed . Still , definitely everyone cup tea , certainly n't perfect free legitimate criticism . I loved LoTR , read twice . They 'fun ' way , I subbed LoTR subreddit reason . There much discuss except plain page ( point quoting books , I find dull ) . Dune though gets brainpan burrows , makes home , lays eggs thoughts ideas speculations ruminations . I dig minute details come away written , spend day discussing others , debating points , arguing , learning , etc . Threads book lead things learn read ponder well outside . I dig . Thanks , Frank . ",1
1451,"I think long form narratives evolution species generational timelines macroscopic scale pinnacle science fiction , small handful authors written compelling , interesting stories within construct . Dune one successful attempt . ",1
1452,"So I n't think Dune best sci-fi novel ever . I believe honor belongs Gene Wolfe _Litany Long Sun_ . But Dune easily top five , thoughtful , slow-paced , flips hero journey inside-out . Paul Atriedes true anti-hero , MCU sense rugged loner plays rules ultimately good , rather , Paul actions may look heroic surface , actually keep pushing path ends brutal galactic war , deaths millions billions , least partially selfish cowardly motivations . IMO , Dune leave one feeling little sad thoughtful .

1459,I liked Dune lot . I would n't say best sci-fi ever . I think right I pick Alastair Reynolds Peter Watts ' Blindsight . What thoughts terraforming Arrakis ? What favorite / best sci-fi read far ? LOTR obviously science fiction . ,1
1460,"( Spoilers ) I ’ big fan Dune potentially even bigger fan God Emperor Dune . The complex world building political drama fantastic , really philosophical ideas around Paul ’ prescience Leto ( Paul ’ ) feels world . ",1
1461,"It took several attempts read Dune seemed ridiculous 80-page appendix . The names ridiculous , I found Paul insufferable . Once I started get , immersive , word I learned added incredible world . The critique hero myth exploitation foreign groups themes also thoughtful . I n't know I would consider Dune best sci-fi book I think sci-fi authors said lot less , I would consider must-read go journey first book . ",1
1462,Herbert spent 5 years designing perfect environment Dune goes without saying setting book near perfection . But I love way almost seamlessly merges science literature . My favourite example Lady Jessica description Paul face . She describes Paul features exquisite distillation random patterns- endless queues happenstance meeting nexus . This almost perfect description meiosis random crossing genes . This description implies Paul perfect mix Lady Jessica Duke . ,1

1472,"I think Dune great reasons ; 1 . So many lessons parallels drawn times probably time 2 . Layer upon layer concepts digest , endless rereading possible learning something new 3 . Virtually continuity errors plot holes 4 . The rest books , god emperor particular expand upon Frank philosophy really interesting 5 . It one first scifi novels proved scifi could taken serious literature brain candy paved way excellent scifi today .

The story cautionary tale greed , political unrest resource control . ",1
1484,"I also finished Dune say I ’ really enjoy . It ’ bummer I super hoping blown away , I ’ even want read sequels . I feel like world building fine nothing exceptional often felt like lot elements shoe horned la ‘ oh yeah thing ’ . Also , almost every major character written insufferably confident clever , like ’ straight /r/iamverysmart .

1486,God Dune nothing like anything else I ever read entire life . ,1
1487,"Well significantly cerebral sci Fi fantasy drama action . Dune political thriller , people trying think things reason things . Or least Herbert put airs trying smart . Some bit leap .

1491,Dune fat kid thinks talking like Ren-Faire reject makes edgy enough hang cool kids . ,0
1492,"I personally think ’ one best novels ever written , sci-fi otherwise . I think important point consider partake story modern age . Whether ’ novel , film , even video game , people seeking entertainment . While entertaining audience nice trick gain attention , I believe people go wrong criticism story adopt lens ’ primary function entertain , I believe hallmark excellent story ’ insight . Dune chock full brilliant insight human condition . Herbert breezes complex insights one sentence books entirety . I ’ avid reader , many . I film analysis day job . I write direct indie films . I shame saying I reread sentences comprehension ’ sake Herbert author . I think ending feels rushed ungratifying way people watched Blade Runner 2049 upset replicant rebellion screen time ; ’ story . Large scale battle scenes ’ necessary , especially since already established beforehand would slaughter Fremen numbers capability severely underestimated Harkonnens . The ending checkmate scene . A boy went hole ground ; house utterly defeated ; father killed , god emperor , cementing fate despised . I ’ think catharsis really right emotion author invoke moment . I think amalgamation triumph dread ‘ present fits story perfectly . ",1
1493,"I thought Dune good ; solid space opera high stakes , interesting mysticism backdrop vast universe deep history . It n't perfect story means political intrigue bog story parts . For best parts book focused Paul relationships mother , wife Fremen . I liked intimacy scenes journey Paul goes become Lisan Al Gaib Kwisats Haderach . ",1
1494,"So , I unabashedly * love * Frank Herbert six Dune Novels . I even like * way * The Lord Rings . I think Frodo walk Mount Doom several orders magnitude less interesting Paul shirking Golden Path , leaving son shatter mankind innate desire follow charismatic leaders . While nothing compares Silmarillion , need start discussing terms . Are comparing four Middle Earth novels vs . The six original Dune novels ? If , 're comparing ? 30 years Bagginses vs 5000 years Dune ? Pro tip ; Dune Dune Messiah read one book . ",1
1495,"Dune good read even know nothing sci-fi genre , becomes apparent learn early sci-fi Dune doubles sort meta-criticism genre . Early sci-fi lot problematic elements way look back Dune today see questionable content . Eugenics decent popular support sci-fi infancy portrayed positively ; idea superior genetics still exists sci-fi day ( look Star Wars ; Disney even calls mainline movies Skywalker saga ) . Another common trope idea lone saviour , intelligent special ones could save humanity ; hardly exclusive sci-fi , certain characteristics staples genre , primarily focus intelligence , well often reclusive shunned strange due said intelligence . These concepts present , flipped head Dune . The eugenics program organized Bene Gesserit produce Messiah ? It contingent generations incest , members genetic lines ( cough cough Baron Harkonnen ) far genetically superior . The lone saviour , case Messiah , rest humanity simply lack ability understand ? Not anything save humanity , simply existing , even needing survive , great tragedies unfold name . This still one layer makes Dune great , already mentioned also convincingly convoluted worldbuilding , stands particularly political intrigue , even reading book many times fresh perspective I would n't found I n't looked genre .

1496,"I think one fairly unique things * Dune * main protagonist n't really protagonist , sufferer inevitable . Yet set cause , . He pawn larger events , like anyone else . The story unfolds without anyone control , makes different heroic stories scifi , particularly point ( 1965 ) .

Without many spoilers , watch mortals grapple hiw actually able see future changes things great . Paul changes lot clear end hero anything . And I DEVOURED God Emperor Dune .

1503,"I ’ say best ever , ’ weird maintains ’ weird mysteriousness throughout . I read sci-fi seems otherworldly . Dune never makes feel like I ’ home , I like . ",1
1505,"Dune favorite . The next two books help . But Dune stand alone . To I tell many people ’ less sci-fi socio-political thriller uses sci-fi properly setup scenario displace preconceived notions otherwise controversial topics . It makes think things like mineral resources ( oil ) , colonialism , conservation differently might Herbert used real world scenarios . While Messiah pick dune left really shows dangers charismatic leader . ",1
1508,"I read Dune absolutely fantastic , blew mind teenager . The politics , intrigues , character depth , locations , drama , everything exquisite spot every level . Enough complexity provide great detail immersion without crossing line heavy overdescribed baroqueness . Nevertheless 15 years later I came across Speaker Dead Orson Scott Card took podium instantly . ",1
1509,"I n't read lot sci-fi , shame I like idea genre , books I tried mostly fallen flat . Dune I enjoyed great depth . It earned place literary world . It entertaining read , took quite get point . Mostly I enjoyed n't issues I find sci-fi , like much high-brow prose , overuse nomenclature , overexplanation science , much action , flat characters , little read lines , sometimes also sexist . Dune contains lot different topics , pretty round , plot eventful executed well . ",1
1511,"I ’ think ’ best sci-fi ever , I think ’ leagues better Legends Dune series . ",1
1512,"If want action , read Book 5 * Heretics Dune * . It ’ actually “ favorite ” series course I ’ know I actually read . It also contains favorite character fiction , The Bashar Miles Teg . I studied politics philosophy college much Dune alley . Frank amazing job world-building note , also way believable . He ’ bog technology specific descriptions would fall prey aging much scifi . His story cultures societies science technology . His adoption current cultures , languages , themes blasting 20,000 years future succeeds blends together cohesive piece brings upon follow-up reads . I ’ even know “ favorite ” science fiction novel , may Neuromancer The Forge God , something one thriller , Dune favorite series whole ’ close . I think ’ important point scifi harder fantasy many ways always core element tied current reality scientific advancement . Fantasy gets make ( I really really ’ mean disrespectfully ) . While Tolkien absolute wizard ( pun intended ) things , I think something said taking real world spinning logical fiction . In end Herbert ’ storytelling epic , treatment characters second none , depth among greatest storytellers I ’ ever encountered . Also , dude handled ecology environmentalism planetary scale decades became thing . ",1
1513,I think best sci fi novel ever entirely subjective . That said . Dune list best books I ’ read genre . I enjoyed politics message trying convey . Paul meant hero . Herbert ’ writing grabbed way unique unforgettable . But opinion . Like I said . The best novel genre entirely subjective . ,1
1514,"Imo , much taste garners attention . I really loved Dune precisely ability grip also spoon-feed action filler I stay engaged . There n't many moments empty tension n't go anywhere . Also young person pretty complex read exciting kids reading readable fiction like YA even poetic fiction like LOTR want something n't talk censor scientific content . I would n't necessarily say fav certainly one best . If one best , assume someone idea best . So hard statement make . When subjective medium kind empty say something best anything form expression much people like . You ca n't competition medium n't series check boxes . Things fluctuate , good bad fluctuates , shouldnt writing story fluctuates . I loved first two books I thought really clever , especially time , use heroes journey tell story less villain . The trope invented words already subverts . I n't read rest I got fill Paul arc first 2 books felt closure . And swap writers felt like taking another franchise I never got around . ",1
1516,"The best part Dune themes political power , selective gene breeding , works , works , overall plot humanity makes masterpiece . Humanity rarely catharsis . It wave highs lows exactly Dune ! The frustrations end , plotline building , characters coming going picture serving plot ( vice versa ) ; Frank Herbert focused plot characters I personally loved . What ride ! ",1
1517,"I sure I fall minority . Dune favorite book , I ca n't get past second book . In full honesty , I know portion I love Dune I read . I found Dune I 15 16 I really identified Paul . It also challenging books I read point . I think Paul really well fleshed character , world building first rate , I feel like Frank Herbert treats reader lot Respect . He n't throw chunks back story allows reader absorbe make connections characters experience world The Second book felt jarring tone subject matter shift . It always felt intended Dune stand alone book , changed mind . ",1
1519,"The Dune series good , Niven Ringworld fun . And everything Known Space . ",0
1520,"The level detail Frank Herbert put world building character motivations extremely compelling . It felt extremely logical . With respect Lord Rings , Herbert sort anti-Tolkien ( obviously masters crafts ) . Tolkien writes literal poetry , spent life creating language , devoted pages descriptions food cultural details . Tolkien deeply religious , work feels mythological . By contrast , Herbert Dune universe firmly rooted access resources power structures . Who controls spice ? Who controls interstellar travel ? Who upper hand fight death , dinner table ? And crux sci-fi genre : imagined resource affect humanity ? I think Dune appeals strongly readers think world similar terms . ",1
1521,"For , lot like reading Tolkien : world extremely well constructed thorough history , mythology , politics , society good fiction , let escape world . While Middle Earth completely shuns tech , Dune mixes high tech , low tech , tech make feel like completely natural . The world feels deep , consistent nuances add cohesive feel whole . It hard balance fictional world well enough willing suspend expectations world looking . ",1
1522,"The plots , world building , different houses , spice main resource/currency people fight , way Dune books related modern politics/society problems . Dune got . Frank Herbert genius . ",1
1523,Shadow Torturer Gene Wolfe way better . Makes Dune seem like sitting bunch undergrad history lectures . ,1
1524,So I definitely ’ think ’ best science fiction novel ’ HUGELY influential . Not emulated science fiction novels notably I believe profoundly influenced George Lucas original Star Wars trilogy . Yes could say Luke ’ typical hero ’ journey ’ also similar Paul ’ . Additionally Tatooine basically Arrakis clone opinion . So mind Dune-lite basically entered analyzed popular discourse 50 years . ,1
1525,"Here ’ quote Frank Herbert ending . You may find helps understand ended intentional . From interview Frank Herbert Willis E. McNelly ( done writing Dune Messiah ) : Herbert : There another thing , pacing story : Very slow beginning . It ’ coital rhythm way story . [ … ] Very slow pace , increasing way , get ending , I chopped non breaking point , person reading story skids story , trailing bits . On I know I successful , people come say want [ … ] McNelly : I said classes , many ways satisfying Dune , I find unsatisfying many unanswered questions ; ’ tie loose ends [ … ] Herbert : The stories remembered ones strike sparks mind , one way another . It ’ like grinding wheel . They touch sparks fly . [ … ] Now , stories go finish reading . As children , remember playing Treasure Island… Or Tom Sawyer… . We remember playing . The story stayed us…the characters conflicts , joys , play stayed us . [ … ] Now , I deliberately Dune purpose . I want person go construct marvelous flights fantasy imagination . I want to… see , ’ Spacing Guild explained completely… enough know existence . Now lots people , ’ got complete . So build minds . [ … ] The sparks flown . ",1
1528,"Dune lot like Lord Rings sense set standard genre massively influential . Personally , I find deconstruction messiah protagonist archetype fascinating , well Frank Herbert portrays prescience fate . It ’ everyone ’ taste though . The characters quite inhuman lack relatable characteristics , ’ also point . They divorced humanity , Paul ’ father compassionate well competent seen highly unusual . Although I think Dune worth Jessica ; one favorite characters ever , anything , ’ favorite female character Frank Herbert ’ write man . It ’ common nowadays see writers think women ought written like men , unique qualities . If female character supposed strong , 9/10 ’ make good fighting , I ’ help think ’ lazy . Jessica fiercely protective family shows everything . She competent fighter , ’ unimportant plot could forgiven forgetting . The fact role mother faithful partner never divorced role political mastermind , makes much intriguing . ",1
1529,"Imagine reading Fellowship Ring thinking entirety n't two books . That like reading Dune reading least first 4 books series , . And let truthful , Tolkien pretty boring times . It read child . As adult I read LOTR 3 4 times . It slog . Can Dune ? Yes , times , I read entire ( expanded universe stuff ) thing 6 7 times I still think best world building sci-fi series . ",1
1530,"Something I always tell people taken reading * Dune * * * This favorite book remember . * * A lot dragging world building lost recollection held detail . When I look back * Dune * I think Action , sinew story , 3 pages describing sandy sand sweaty Paul got visions . The word I found accurately describe reading 6 * Dune * books Slog . They drag drag monotone times looking back I head wonderful series describing galactic-political events around almost occult ideology . I know post n't bring movie , I think might help people understand view-point . A good * Dune * movie strictly faithful books , faithful * dune * movie good movie . ",1
1531,Dune looked sci-fi novel fantasy novel . It best aspects science instilled theme weaved ultimately fantastical world . Dune compared world star wars rather lord rings . ,1
1532,"I feel dune trying teach interpretation meaning life way sci-fi n't , succeeds . Life mystery solved , reality experience . This struck deep chord way I n't experienced sci fi . Also , I love Machiavellian political stories . ",1
1533,"Dune A+ science fiction choice , par Lord rings quality writing ( , I implying one series better . They best class genres ) . I like give shout Author C. Clarke Rendezvous Rama series Issac Asimov Foundation series . ",1
1535,"Mainly world building I love , I like getting lost dunes . ",1
1536,"Comparing DUNE lord rings star wars common thing . Honestly DUNE old tho , much older style novel . It really surprising would fall bit flat used style . Like people fail realize original DUNE old original Star Trek novels . I personally really enjoyed DUNE growing , carries certain gravitas newer novels lack . The authors voice carries really well throughout feels like cohesive whole . ",1

1545,"Dune great escapist Science fiction novel , read first book , find much . My personal favorite The God emperor Dune ",1
1549,You read Dune Messiah . It puts first book place- makes Dune masterpiece . ,1
1554,"I ’ never read perfect way describe Dune wrote . Amazingly done , thank ! ",1
1555,"You sorta hit nail head I liked . It crosses lot ground quite complex without ever becoming unwieldy difficult understand . I think complexity lends well imagination . Our world complex , stands reason worlds may . It sci-fi novel set space ( well , planet somewhere space ) cares little space travel aspect . Its politics , religion , capitalism , oppression , tribalism , legacy , family . You name . If skimmed would seem shallow good Vs bad story much complex ( Paul alludes throughout book , trying avoid catastrophe carried Fremen name ) . You think Paul good guy , kinda root towards end , end actions cause destruction lost . The road hell paved good intentions . As someone else alluded , sort ends Hitler type character ( although need read Messiah reach element story ) Jesus type character rolled one . I terrible job explaining complexities point , many layers impressive n't become unreadable . For record I fan Messiah Children Dune . Messiah I felt failed attempt sort try resolve story * * * * end abruptly Children Dune almost like retelling Dune slight tweak . ",1
1556,"That exactly feeling . Thank expressing well . I read books loved mixture world created . But favourite I astonished someone really thinks comparable works J.R.R . Tolkien . Why ? Because Tolkiens language rich colourful . Just month I heard audio book 'Dune ' amount 'Paul said ' , ' Gurney said ' , ' Jessica said ' really bugging . It n't occur reading books , explained book n't rank higher list . ",1
1557,"This also primary interest - I think aesthetic setting Dune incredibly rich . It combines disparate ideas way , somehow , makes sense . Actually , one book weaknesses , I think , frequently misplaces reader focus - assumes need know complex world building details * yesterday , * understand world invest characters . It fitting Irulan directs reader focus place right story starts . But I wanted whole time emphasis character motivation psychology . For , engagement setting always proportional engagement people live . More I need know * * things happen , I need know * . * Does make sense ? ",1
1558,"It tendency really shoehorn terms despite making sense . Spice pretty much always described hallucinogenic mind-expanding properties , yet referred 'geriatric spice ' ( presumably due extending lifespans ) . Felt constantly awkward . Like would brain-zapping space drugs associated elderly things ? Or entire 'Dune ' aspect feels need force justification Dune common nickname Arakis , despite one person using I tell . Also lots swords yet polearms , despite perhaps perfect weapon dealing slow-shields universe . Anything else pretty much encourages awkward wrestling matches . ",0
1561,"Well said . I often feel consumers desperate need catharsis media , reason many stories bland hell . To girlfriend chagrin I tell , ending , also way every single book movie watch , tuned ending give consumer satisfying catharsis pretty safe bet story . Dune n't kind story reads like actual history , fiction . And live history . ",1
1562,"This great analysis - love GoT meets Star Wars comp ! I loveD politics I guess , related point I suppose well developed characters relationships . Also agree OP abruptness ending completely spoils book prevents full masterpiece . I saw thread Dune sub saw quite folk saying abrupt ending deliberate writing technique reflect Paul experience events speeding . Imo whether deliberate writing technique , happenstance , sucked ! ",1
1564,"This great comment . Dune n't action plot , though I personally enjoy elements story . It people , society , environment . Everyone story , even Padishah Emperor , constrained society live society live constrained environment built upon . Yet individual people influence environment , Fremen try terraform Arrakis . ",1
1565,"The last three series definitely favorite . It ’ series gets interesting time . And I agree ’ sci-fi book ’ really religion , I ’ always found extremely fascinating . Glad see many Dune fans chat ! ",1
1566,"Adding groundbreaking points . It took FH six years research writing complete . That unheard . Typical science fiction quickly produced bit “ Have Ray Gun , Will Travel ” back started ’ work . Apologies Mr Clarke Dr Asimov . IIRC , Frank Herbert ’ agent aghast taking long . Of course produced world building depth compl seen “ SCI-FI “ genre . It also modern way ground breaking . He used words like “ ecology “ “ ecosystem. ” This time Americans hardly heard words understood . “ Ecologist ? Wasn ’ bearded hippie stuff American business ? ” Hippies also Did Drugs ! Remember back , mind altering drugs bad ! Bad bad bad . Jazz cigarettes , Mary-Jane , smack , uppers , downers , . Especially new psychedelics , many taught , made teenagers think could fly jump roof . Now book government ecologist economy ( empire ? ) based mind altering drug . Thus Young Generation latched onto , usual suspects genre readers . If classic Science Fiction Big Band music , Rock Roll ! To carry thick paperback Dune signal others stood things . Having read The Lord Of The Rings trilogy also way show . Other writers examining impact Dune done better . There several articles cover . My take comes observations older sister ’ friends world around I kid late 60s/early 70s . ",1
1567,"I read Dune first time 5 years ago surprised written 60 , thought 'wow , modern sci fi comes ' ; went read starship troopers ( late 50 ) really enjoyed . Now I early stages The Foundation trilogy ( early 50 ) blowing mind . Like , writers able come technology ? I mixing Neuromancer ( mid 80 ) feels like blade runner , I guess ? Also liking far . ",1
1570,"True , I still take one Lotr series first Dune . I think frank herbert genius book well-written , first book series n't enough really pull , I usually wo n't continue . ",1
1574,"I n't really enjoy Messiah much first novel , Children Dune grips . ",1

1578,Messiah much worse book Dune . ,0
1579,"I really idea people like Messiah . I loved Dune , read half Messiah gave . ",0
1581,"This exactly I look stories , might explain I loved Dune much . It feeling vast world 're seeing small part . So many stories miss mark either feel grand empty . It especially sucks feels like whole world tv set empty studio outside walls . ",1
1583,"Your first two complaints nonsense . Geriatric context n't mean associated elderly , means life-extending . You clearly know , level , I idea 're even trying say . The fact barely anyone story uses nickname Dune Arrakis irrelevant meaningless quibble I speculate Herbert would baffled could n't come number justifications . Wasting time typing sentence explaining characters book n't use nickname planet 're discussing would jarring vaguely insulting audience . They use swords swords cooler polearms . ",1
1586,"Personally , I much prefer Dune Hyperion . Not Hyperion bad anything , think n't thing . That said , I probably cliché cyberpunk fans always recommend Neuromancer . ",1
1591,"Yes , much . Dune great subversion white savior heroes journey fantastic world building political commentary petrol politics - ’ taken actual thesis magnum opus God Emperor closes circle becomes actual work philosophy unique meditation whole host issues common humanity civilization really earns title . It ’ got really fantastic things say interplay authoritarianism libertarianism ( like American libertarian parties liberty concept ) , nature vrs nurture , self vrs society , purpose vrs destiny , etc… mostly though kind dialectic ’ resolve synthesis bit like yin yang , necessary constant tension flow , birthing ’ opposite endless cycle whose disruption lead consequences far beyond understanding .

1592,It also lot influence . People read lot genre see dune books set nee standard world building . ,1

Did pull fucking Scrabble bag ? Same goes names number main characters , rubbed wrong way every time I read ( admittedly pretty subjective gripe , ) . I also could n't stand Paul protagonist . Again , rubbed wrong way reason . It years since I read book I ca n't recall many details , I completely underwhelmed book many people tout one sci-fi/fantasy greats .

But I seem see things every day life books . It ’ long littler hover lamps . You already change color lights like thought 1965 . It ’ matter time follow around house like drone . ",1
2056,I really n't like Dune Messiah . The fourth book one came close original . They 're still bad way pass time though . ,0
2058,The first 150 pages Messiah fly well . So much momentum moving parts . There slow areas I started reading hours I half way done . I put side something else I n't burn quarantine wish list week . I ca n't buying dune books . ,1
2059,"I understand lot people finish God Emperor , I think last two definitely worth reading . I n't think I properly understood entire narrative arc series part-way one last two . The original draw series may long gone point , bring thematic arcs completion . Also , Heretics Chapterhouse coolest characters action sequences since Dune , 're much enjoyable reads GEoD . ",1
2063,"While Lynch movie pretty cool , also pretty 'Lynch ' . Did happen wathc 2000 scifi Dune miniseries ? It faithful books , may worth watch ! IIRC , somewhat better Feyd-Rautha backstory . ",1

Dune pushes hard prophecies thingie plus notion individuals simply born superior , fremens much biblical old testament space really .

2074,"If felt like wanted end * Dune * , * Dune Messiah * perfect . It explores implications ending complex relationships characters . I really enjoyed . ",1
2076,I loved every one Frank Dune books ! I read every one course like month half . My dad tried decade get read I said boring . Then I picked one day literally every break work day absorbed books . ,1
2080,"I agree unpopular opinion . I think kind funny Hunter Dune written Frank died Machine books taken extensive notes Frank could put together book well . Outside , I agree writing pretty mediocre . IMO worse Star Wars fan novel something . ",1
2081,"I agree . I probably owe re-read , I n't know . But I really n't like . And I made Blindsight , I liked , currently enjoying Anathem . So I opposed big potentially boring books . Dune n't sit right reason . ",0
2082,"The deconstruction obvious first book . You still read superhero story , even worse , white saviour story . Subsequent books harsher Paul , I n't want spoil . If n't plan read books , search dune deconstruction hero . Some hints already present Dune : Paul seeing friends change worshippers , Jessica creating abomination , Jessica afraid Paul ( monster created ) , Jessica Paul cynically manipulating Fremen Missionaria Protectiva , brutality Fremen troops Paul command , vision future slaughter . Paul prescience calculation make even worse , conscious decisions alternatives even worse . Yes , written really easy reader accept , rationalize . After , Paul greater good , right ? But similar mechanism makes many people venerate Stalin today , despite millions victims , despite Gulag , Holodomor Great Purge . After , defeated Hitler make world better place poor . Now , replace Stalin Paul , Hitler Baron , imperialistic society built exploitation working class terrible future Paul works avoid - get picture . ",1
2083,"I admit , I tried read atleast 4 , maybe 5 times . Furthest I get halfway , I ca n't stand . I love world building , dune universe fascinates . I want badly find book entertaining like many others .... I feel like I missing something I try slog damn bland . The writing nothing gets point I fighting keep reading . All praise book always gets makes feel like I missing something . ",0
2084,"I know unpopular opinion Machine series Frank writing compiled Brian Kevin Anderson Hunter Dune . I think really excellent books provide much information created Dune world Machine crusade , left hanging Chapterhouse Dune , I found Hunter Dune extremely satisfying every bit tight Frank works . ",1
2086,"I share opinion later books much interesting , God Emperor Heretics especially . The first book excellent , reads like fantasy novel times . It exposition , understandable . What makes Dune universe special , though , n't need magic knick knacks story . The writing best pondering nature causality , humanity , civilization . ",1
2087,"I remember thinking young teenager , much I hated God Emperor character . I could fathom concept ill greater good . I also bothered character I fond Children , I presented something completely different . When read 20 I got I enjoyed thoroughly . I think deep , like Dune . Dune I probably read seven times least , God Emperor I think three times . ",1
2089,IDK I much enjoyed Butlerian Jihad The Machine Crusade . I think moreso answered lot questions I regards history Dune universe . ,1
2095,My issue I never give book came bite Dune . From halfway point book became absolute chore . I n't really understand time jumps physics lot critical scenes ( I genuinely n't know happened Sandworm bits ) . ,0
2097,"I feel bad Brian Herbert sometimes . He wants honor Dad legacy clearly , quite frankly , sucks writer . I wonder knows known good among Dune fans . ",0
2100,"I think subtle Dune makes abundantly clear second one . The first one presents something n't . It says hey I fun scifi heroes journey reality subversion . As people liking rest series speak mate . Dune dense , get little everytime read . ",0
2102,"I really disliked conclusions drew last book . It felt like contradicted lot Frank Hebert set shoe horn ideas prequel novels . I wish publish actual Dune 7 notes supposedly found , though I think better chance seeing Snyder Cut . ",0
2104,"All family guild/school books sucked imo started really reaching . It like using little sentences Frank written , context . Frank built huge world like Tolkien . A lot world never made books . I feel Machine series mostly fathers writings . It really read felt like Frank . I also thought conclusion books really tight thought came father writings . I think clear started getting family series common theme running , writing bit disjointed , lot less tight . I think point pulling blurbs different parts Dad work/world putting . I read everything Frank Herbert wrote . The Dune series grabbed , rest books set hook . The Jesus Incident Dosadi series desert . ",1
2105,"Yeah , I feel bad . But , I ca n't stand writing much I trouble making book Frank wrote together ( Man Two Worlds ) . Then I tried Dune prequels , I forced House Atreides gave halfway House Harkonnen . ",0

2114,"There also chance Wiki article written poorly subjectively . I recommended actually looking first 2 pages book , synopsis anonymous person . The book 90 % Frank mostly written died . I believe anyone compares actual writing something like Hunter Dune House Harkonen , House Atriedes , etc would obvious much Hunters like Frank Herbert books , rookie like . ",1

2121,"Herbert n't invent science Dune . That kind thing anyone could get reading Scientific American . The story parable happens vital resource controlled single party . Oil real-life spice .

Star Wars mash-up homage delightful matinee serials folks Lucas ' age saw children storyline straight Joseph Campbell The Hero Thousand Faces , enlightening book comparative mythology .

2128,"Well , first , let ’ address think Frank Herbert ’ writing white savior purpose . He absolutely . Dune Dune Messiah perhaps damning indictment savior figures ever written , Herbert drawing heavily real world colonialism creating relationship Empire , Fremen , especially Paul ’ role chosen one . I see confusion , though , really comes head Dune Messiah . And Star Wars , yes . I ’ argue A New Hope homage every type story George Lucas loved : sci-fi like Dune Flash Gordon , Akira Kurosawa-style samurai epics , , hero ’ journey . Both Dune Star Wars draw heavily hero ’ journey , ’ debatable whether Lucas really “ ripped ” common format writing story millennia . And much named Frank Herbert really invent ? He inspired books George Lucas . Desert dwelling people created irrigation systems long deserts , Dune uninterested actual space travel ’ bear comparing Star Wars prominently features space travel . However , best defense Star Wars really needs tries something fundamentally different Dune . The similarities begin end fact stories conscious stories . Star Wars fun action adventure story farmboy becoming hero , ideally meant uplift kids idea circumstances make difference ( buying Star Wars action figures , course ) . Dune repudiation idea one person change world better , . Cults personality dangerous toxic , treating man anything man going result blind fanaticism .

2140,"So much costume production design actual star wars movies failed production Dune Spanish filmmaker named Alejandro Jodorowsky tried get going . Had mad film , would big Avatar , I think . All pitched ideas concept art movie kept various studios producers Jodorowsky co. pitched Dune found way hands Lucasfilm . ",0

2151,"Read Dune Messiah . The White Savior trope one Frank Herbert personally seemed hate , actively goes way sequels rip rug . It foreshadowed pretty hard Dune well , yes , Paul hailed Messiah manufactured said Messiah , plunging headfirst Terrible Purpose , coincides survival . ",1
2155,"> My major criticism white savior trope pervasive literature And clearly n't read best book ever read carefully . Also , truly appreciate whole story , Dune Messiah pretty much required read .

But I never understand praise actual writing receives . ",1
2259,"I recently re-read Dune , although I could see flaws today would considered rule-breaking , n't bother . I engaged interested story ; I kept turning pages . The head-hopping POV shifts actually worked terms showing complexity issue political machinations . But I found head-hopping also concealed fact apparently complex issues n't really complex . When read character trying figure loyalties , assigning motives , even saying one deep , conceals fact actual events n't really complicated .

Am I supposed surprised happened ? Why ? The second book felt like stripped world building character development .

Dune spans whole galaxy several house governments , overthrow main empire , theocratic empire rising edge , worlds . The scope different . If liked Dune I ca n't plug Sun Eater enough .

2305,"IMO Dune excellent worldbuilding , good plotting , prose mostly n't amazingly poetic anything ( edit : except gom jabbar scene ) , gets job done . Where Dune really falls flat face characterization . It like asoiaf big epic drama filled sympathetic villains , deeply flawed heroes , family relationships ranging heartwarming horrific .

There many options I sure others recommend throw options try Brandon Sanderson Mistborn Series ( complete ) newer Stormlight Archive ( significant body work done , progress ) , many works . The imaginative plots writing quality may I boldly suggest even better Hebert . Peter V. Brett Demon Cycle brisk ride 5+ lengthy novels never slows least- crisp yet super enjoyable I would say . Brent Weeks also completed series I enjoyed tremendously . Lastly- I hesitate- I must tell book I read others , story singlehandedly turned one dismissed fantasy/scifi obsessed fan . I conflicted though series unfinished I sure ever finished . The Name Wind Patrick Rothfuss incredible writing pull world like nothing I ever experienced since . It standalone masterpiece written English professor- well written I question I ever see day I look book think huh , might finely crafted Name Wind .

I awe perceived complexity I felt profound ideas written elegantly . Fast forward 2018 . I decide reread novels movie buzz . While complexity still present , I could n't get past self-consciously wordy prose . Herbert n't say something well sentences could instead fill page .

Paul , like I said , interesting concept - hero powers kind curse inevitably cause terrible atrocities - n't interesting . Everything comes fairly easy even thoughts role coming Jihad come really detached almost academic . A lot side characters could interesting , ultimately n't much book . And Chani . Chani must one boring characters I ever read . Her main defining character trait seems Paul love interest . Not given reason like individually , 're given reason invested relationship Paul . Their relationship develops almost entirely timeskip . IIRC , literally go meeting already kid together ( A kid btw introduced offscreen killed course chapter . I sure readers supposed care happened , I sure reader could ) . Being unable invest Chani way less problem first book second book , entire plot revolves around people trying kill . I know political intrigue n't really type story Herbert trying tell Dune , falls flat . There many plans either work immediately completely dropped . Thufir Hawat spends chapters plotting Harkonens , literally nothing ever comes . Gurney Halleck smuggler , nothing matters either . The Harkonen plot defeat Duke Leto works . No real kinks . No need adjust plan . No real counterstrokes Duke Leto . Same Paul plan retake city . Everything goes according plan .

He spends astonishingly little time worms spends huge chunk book endlessly rehashing Bene Gesserit prophecies , clan family interactions , Paul growing Messiah-hood . All political intrigue could interesting , except characters little dimension - Leto Atreides good , oh-so-good ( Damn profits , save men ! ) Baron bad , oh-so-bad ( Bring drugged slave-boys rape ! ) .

At one point , Lady Jessica says something like We Bene Gesserit saying proceeds rattle paragraph un-rememberable gibberish . It far cry creating real axiom fiction , like Tolkien Not wander lost . And notice nearly characters speak exact way - wordy , overly formal sentences ? In good dialogue , characters use totally different voices , even conveying similar information .

They kind deal existential type questions questions next humanity . * * Douglas Adams * * : The Hitchhiker Guide Galaxy series ( publisher added additional one passing written Eoin Colfer [ Artemis Fowl ] pretty good ) .

I read ones son co-wrote found poor imitations . The stories n't bad , style . If 're classics sci-fi , delve Asimov Foundation series . Arthur Clarke Rama series also pretty good , Dan Simmons ' Hyperion duology . If want something really mind-bending , could check Gene Wolfe , although prose dense . If like PKD , many good books : My personal favorites Flow My Tears , The Policeman Said , We Can Build You , A Scanner Darkly ( short story collections also good—if read enough , begin realize many ideas adapted directly borrowed sci-fi last couple decades ) .

I half way Machine Crusade hard time staying interested . It action oriented lot seems like filler . Previously , I read house series Brian enjoyed . It original means , neat see main characters Dune develop even inconsistencies . The 3 I reading explain origins BG , guild Ginaz mercenaries .

Those found Frank books , loved son books . The main thing makes love Frank writing son Frank books hundreds years pass books . So many things changed reader left trying figure changed via politics undercurrents characters . In many cases , truly never learn changes society . You know things changed , never quite know changed caused mystery made world interesting .

Messiah , Children Dune , God Emperor fun , storyline history important . Heretics Chapterhouse exciting intense .

( I plan reread day see . ) I feel like Mr. Herbert left end story unfinished . And I read reviews , I n't want go dark place extended dune universe find might wanted go . tldr : I would stop book four . On side Note : one great things getting old able go back reread books new eyes away plot years . I read dune late teen years ; I thirty I rereading Dune . The one thing jumps , I older , Frank Herbert bigger ideas writing skills . But still might wrote best Science Fiction novel time . ",1
3908,"I going right started Children Dune . Dune Messiah great , I least engaged Children far , warned : 're stickler continuity , * * start banging head wall certain points ( especially concerns Alia origins , exactly , makes abomination ) .

3909,Dune best one . The rest leave heart ache wanting . ,1
3911,"Dune Messiah excellent ! Children Dune , I think , go . Are reading series parallels geopolitics , sci-fi , vested characters ? Geopolitics ? Stop Dune Messiah . Sci-fi ? Have fun Children Dune . Vested story/characters ? Children Dune may worthwhile may find sailed edge map . After Herbert original trilogy fan-fic imo . Not say bad , means capture complexity Dune/Dune Messiah straight forward sci-fi . ",1

3915,"I might fringe , I thoroughly enjoyed ending saga . The dune books get progressively slower odder throughout series Chapterhouse , books Brian wrote n't good ( really surprise though , Brian Frank thoroughly different calibers author ) , last half Hunters tied whole saga together fantastically I could happier . Of course , canon issues aside , I also really enjoyed Butlerian Jihad trilogy . If willing endure slow books , ending well worth wait , even better read butlerian Jihad get . TL ; DR Great books , gets slow , ending well worth . 9/10 would recommend . Edit : Mixed lesser stories son . Whoops . ",1

Dragon Sea - His first novel set entirely submarine focusing unraveling psyches small crew Dosadi Experiment - Set world designed awful possible characters basically super human since need survive difficult world ( think Fremen . ) Destination Void - A pretty abstract look artificial intelligence human potential . Four scientists basically trained incredibly competent ( Herbert theme ever one ) put situation success statistically impossible . The way basically transcend .

The emphasis entirely political cultural philopsophy , feel compassion pain main character- one I feel interesting Paul first book . You see clash span human life vs thousands years living god .

3977,Some boring beyond belief The Winds Dune No redeeming value . Just stick ones written Frank Herbert enjoy . ,0
3979,"NO ! Save time energy . Dune wonderful novel , ended right .......... It totally worth reading . ",0
3980,"I also absolutely loved Dune . So much I read every book ( 6 total I think ) written Herbert Himself . While I say quite good original , really I worth read , see story goes . I n't read books written frank though , I ca n't say good n't appeal . ",1
3981,"It strange incredibly different Dune rest series . The first book reads like standard SciFi rest read like kind Gothic incantation . As Gormenghast trilogy crossed Ender Game . I enjoyed 2nd book , got 3rd ended . ",1
3982,"All books , especially ones written FH worth reading . I also enjoyed prequels writen son , arent terrible , entertaining , far writers go , I think probably guy access annotations Dune universe ideas gathered father . Feeling certainly divergent among different people . I would suggest , finishing original material , take prequels historical order give try . The best judge . ",1
3984,"I always thought * Hyperion * Dan Simmons book rivals * Dune * scope creativity . I strongly recommend . The * Dune * books Frank Herbert good , I recommend , ( opinion ) n't quite great original . In addition * Hyperion * * Dune * , standard sci-fi recommendations : * * Anathem * * Snow Crash * Neal Stephenson * * A Fire Upon Deep * Vernor Vinge * * Lord Light * Roger Zelazny * * Use Weapons * Ian Banks * * The Demolished Man * Alfred Bester * * A Scanner Darkly * Philip K. Dick I would also add : * * Book New Sun * Gene Wolfe * * Fiasco * Stanislaw Lem bit tougher going ones . ",1
3985,"I liked , even spinoffs - like House Harkonnen/Atreides/Corino Butlerian Jihad trilogy . Not good Dune , still pretty great Sci-Fi . ",1
3986,"I safely recommend finish first four books . Dune Children crown jewels series , good things messiah god emp . Chapterhouse iffy . I like , easy see people n't enjoy terribly much . As anything beyond , house books , jihad books , follow ups written son quite well written , n't capable giving suspense politically charged nuances primary six give . Tl ; dr , read first four , maybe chapterhouse . If still want . You wo n't hate expanded content . ",1
3987,"Here another great series/book check enjoyed Dune : [ The Great Book Amber ] ( http : //www.amazon.com/The-Great-Book-Amber-Chronicles/dp/0380809060 ) , Roger Zelanzy . It actually 10 books combined one Great Book . Really interesting mind-bending mystery sci-fi , plot points keep guessing end , written general time period Dune ( 1970-1991 ) . It wild ride ! Plus , know , philosophical musings humanity love much sci-fi/fantasy : ) ",1
3988,"I love Frank Herbert , mixed feelings second series followed death ( written son & another famous writer . ) In , I read 12 books series , always read come . I kind like reading female characters , learning female responsible method travel used Spacing Guild good thing . In , many books followed gave weight women Dune , actually helped build characters better . Developing good role model characters also female ( instead looking women uninteresting objects ) determines I stick series . I always amazed women continue ignored historically literature . Half population female , yet look literature - still good old boys club . ",1
3989,"Great question ! I would recommend read series way God Emperor Dune . After , really tell Frank longer writing creativity rather need cash another paycheck publisher . The main theme everything lead fully understand Golden Path ( genius strategy long term survival btw ) . That dictator could utterly oppressive , become tyrant extremes entire human race explodes escape . Leto II uses nature repression desire freedom catalyst ensure humanity saved eventual destruction hands future AI . I realized I might shared spoilers , series huge asked question ! ",0
3990,"I read first three Dune books enjoyed immensely . Then I lost interest series . For really classic Science Fiction , read PKD books aside Androids Dream , like VALIS Ubik . You definitely read Foundationb Trilogy Asimov , towering classic science fiction . Heinlein The Moon Harsh Mistress also excellent must read , Starship Troopers Stranger Strange Land . The holy trinity science fiction course Asimov , Heinlein , Clarke . I highly suggest reading Childhood End Rendezvous Rama Clarke . Also read Ringworld Footfall Larry Niven . Niven excellent writer still writing today . My favorite obscure science fiction writer Roger Zelazny . Chronicles Amber , original trilogy , unfortgettable . ",1
3991,"I would definitely recommend Legends Dune trilogy . It Is set 10000 years past basically works way everything got way Dune starts ; like read origins every major piece Dune , sisterhood , mentats , houses , space guild , etc . It epic original Dune , written Franks son ( another dude ) built notes Frank left behind . I loved trilogy , I plan revisit sometime since several years . ",1
3992,"I way late thread , worth please love god , n't read Brian Herbert books . Stick original Frank Herbert ones . The new additions really , really bad . The cash-in son depressing think . It possible may started good intentions , ( and/or Kevin J. Anderson ) talent compare father . At least voice suit Dune universe . ",0
3993,My personal favorites Messiah Children Dune . I finished Chapterhouse ( rounding original Frank Herbert series ) pretty good . ,1
3996,"I would recommend reading first three . Dune , Dune Messiah , Children Dune . Those three take place close . After gets little strange characters ca n't really connect way Atradies . I recommend reading Hyperion series So far I two books four amazing . ",1
3999,"Dune magnum opus , page-turner . drawn completely . follows seems belabored bit tiresome , finally series descends snoratorium ca n't stay awake . many fascinating books available , might want spend time fine works instead ruining Dune experience . expect gone Foundation trilogy everything prolific Isaac Asimov . might like Illearth War , Chronicles Thomas Covenant Unbeliever ( Stephen R. Donaldson ) . Riverworld ( Philip José Farmer ) good . course , would probably enjoy everything written famed science fiction writer , Kilgore Trout , otherwise called Kurt Vonnegut , Jr . ",0
4000,"Herbert sequels good good dune opinion . The books son , well ",0
4002,"All Frank Herbert Dune novels definitely worth reading I think best taken whole ( I n't really favourite/least favourite ) . The execution Hunters Sandworms frustrating disappointing I glad I read understanding Frank Herbert intended story . Also Frank Herbert books I read fantastic n't seem get nearly enough attention : The White Plague , Destination Void series , Dosadi Experiment , Santaroga Barrier tons 're great . ",1
4003,"You read every Dune book get hands I enjoyed . Frank Herbert different level writing son , appreciated way . I glad I read entire series . ",1
4004,"Im currently reading second one . It pretty good , adds onto . I recommend since great books regardless . I kind read pooper otherwise finished . ( Read First Dune toilet , also watched original Dune movie many times , also extended edition 3 part movie series also ) . So I like get I series good imo . ",1
4005,"I found Dune universe amazing , Herbert often tries force literal analogy Earth history cultures n't necessary . If 're unsure books want experience essence , I think may enjoy TV series Dune , sequel . The first one stars William Hurt Duke second one - Children Dune James McAvoy . They 're entertaining good enough letting know want go deeper . Of course also Culture books , Empire-Foundation Novels Asimov . He good job tieing everything together . The early books crime novels evolve politico - universe novels . It worth . ",1
4007,"I major Dune fan , I read books exception recently released Mentats Dune . I wanted say Brian Kevin inferior writers , read ending series I found worth . Frank Herbert incredible vision , ending seriously Epic , ca n't imagine fulfilling one . PS . You also catch Jordorowsky documentary DUNE almost made greatest sci-fi movie ever . Starring Orson Welles , Salvador Dali , original music Pink Floyd . ",1
4008,I like pre-quels build Dune series . Currently working Mentats Dune . Kevin Herbert pretty decent job carrying . ,1
4010,"Having read five six volume series ( six volumes Frank Herbert died , later ones ) I say resoundingly , No . The theme Dune repeated next four books . With changes mind , essentially repeated . The fourth one slightly interesting perspective book different ( almost solely Leto Atriedes ) recipe . On deeper note , entire Dune-universe depressing . It low-technology nightmare innumerable Middle-Eastern overtones . The society primitively feudalistic real structure . Certainly expected sci-fi world . One would expect , least , universe one could ask BeanMachine hot cup coffee . Instead , BeanMachines outlawed ridiculous Butlerian Jihad mode thought . The mere use word Jihad many overtones religion destroys entire framework . It long reading time-wasting . If one standing line DMV , better ways spend one time . ",1
4011,dune messiah great . See without seeing Herbert genius ! ,1
4012,"It sucks , chapterhouse I wondered I even bothered reading past children . The original children Dune ones I liked . ",0
4014,"It late try , I read series I read every book chronologically , I glad I went way . Having never read original , even foggiest idea starting The Butlerian Jihad let actually enjoy books way , I think . By time I actually hit Dune I already invested enjoying series . It n't best I read , pretty good . But I actually started reading original , I blown away much better terms writing style character development . Frank Herberts language seemed much evolved thought provoking . It completely different level everything I already read . The downside Frank Herberts writing , I lost interest books son wrote continued story . I Finished 7th book , like trying go back NyQuil I got used Literary Heroin . I glad I read first , I anything compare . ",1
4015,"I read chapter house ( book 6 , last series Frank Herbert ) . Sadly , , second one Dune Messiah , weakest long way . I found Children Dune ( third ) one best also last two pretty good . It , Dune Messiah much tying loose ends Dune , much plot drags bit . Personally I totally recommend reading six maybe skipping second one . Not sure confusing would probably get away . ",1
4016,"Yes . Yes . I read Dune , Dune Messiah Children Dune yet unimpressed . ",1
4018,"Read . Own . The original series awesome . The expanded series son ghost writer worth read enjoy universe Dune want expand . They well done ones FH , n't think anyone going . ",1
4021,"I read good number , son took helped finish . I thought pretty good . Dune obviously masterpiece series , others would still hold water science fiction . The depth scope books amazing . ",1
4024,"I think pretty good ( please n't hurt ) , even ones Frank Herbert death ( although original one fastest reads I could n't put , others I meandered ) . BUT ( big , I lie ) I really enjoy reading history bene gesserit houses got politcal squabbles ended shifting roles years . Also , thing dad I together , read Dune , watched mini series , movies , TV events , thing , communicate sometimes . ",1
4025,"Bare minimum must read God Emperor Dune miss flavor Dune universe . Thought personally I loved God Emperor Dune , even though may find boring , I think critical understanding series fully appreciating . But books written Frank good worth time opinion . ",1

4029,Children Dune great . The second one meh . ,1
4030,I read order released enjoyed . Later I read chronological order starting The Butlerian Jihad . It awesome . I say however Dune probably best stand alone book series . ,1
4031,"Well , I give go , even though time things hit front page 're done death . Dune masterpiece time even serious prescience ( giggle ) toward times . It speaks single-source dependent economy mixed religion outcast beaten . It speaks people would rather destroy wealth enslaved .

Dissatisfaction economic policies times ? Check . Frustration lot life ? Check . Dreaming unborn greatness ? Check . Feelings hidden talent suppressed knowledge ? This book totally written toward young generation 're engrossed high-school feelings age time goes . The use medieval weapons like knives explained shields let slow moves . What teenage ( male ) n't fascination knives swords point life ? My six-year-old building light-sabers seen Star Wars . Honestly , book many new ideas , I going get lot hate I know I backed several thousand dollars sci-fi literture years spent turning pages : Frank Herbert really n't amazing writer . He amazing thinker . He ideas waaaay beyond time many ways ( many books ) unbalanced writer . Pick random sentence Duncan , Leto , Jessica , Yueh , Paul . Jumble says ? Do whole script dialogue . The man genius , yes , write succinct definite characters . It actually traces books . Amazing ideas manage transcend comes across rather single minded . The best The Green Brain , even masochistic old testament . I big Herbert fan , lets build monuments , needed help . The job The White Plague actually sort offensive I recognized I read 9 . In actual answer question , yes read rest books . Up Chapterhouse exactly expect . As prequels sequels -for Christs ' sake Necronomicon ! Look , read front cover see , guy . This like people offended Brian Sanderson took Robert Jordan . Jesus folks , author DEAD . Quit whining grateful finally understood part going . Brian Herbert access notes Frank thought battle Corrin The Enemy actually . Truth told I always felt like Dune supposed sell script rest books actually Frank way telling story .

I personally would recommend reading Dune : Chapterhouse - even though I personally found Dune Messiah Children Dune painfully dull - start finish Legends Dune trilogy moving onto final two ; Hunters & Sandworms Dune . From perspective reading currently released novels , I would n't fault Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson , going even far saying I prefer writing style . TLDR : The original series Legends Dune far best books . However , like universe Dune read additional novels fill gaps . ",1

The heroes spent time dialog emotions actually emoting . Well , I n't care world building . The sand worms mission protectiva kinda cool , believable things . None setting elements really captured imagination . A lot felt extremely artificial ( e.g . I want write sword fighting , shields require attack slow , defend quickly ) , many elements introduced really relevant one two scenes ( whole gladiator fight , antigravity suspenders ) .

The fourth book heavy philosophical monologues fast-forwards story 3500 years makes Dune universe truly epic scope see evolved . It provides good conclusion story Atreides .

The technology society strange mishmash anachronisms . Spaceships , force fields ornithopters , swords words power . I see Herbert trying , I believe makes . We get hints vast , ancient society . We get political intrigue feudal ruling class , anthropology desert people , mix middle eastern western cultures languages , weird aliens unsatisfactory climax battle .

It n't translate sexual practices , though . ",1
4442,"I mean , first book setup downfall second book ( really , imo one book split two parts rise fall Paul ) , stuff complained seems like 're missing point . Who gives shit fascist super soldiers losing screen already made clear Fremen better top peak environment . The Fremen supersoldiers produced environment intentionally powers ( ( super fucked ) ) produce army overrun existing power paradigm entrapping people however , lacked necessary goals constructive next step movement destructive . To destroy evil without concept better world produce evil cycle ( case , worse ) . Nobody , least , wants sit fight scene inevitable fact know comes true . The Fremen , oppressed , know become oppressors throughout book find Paul visions coming true without agency everything put place moment occur knowledge care inevitably lead fascistic genocide control person charge . The Benni Gesserit spent HUNDREDS ( maybe millenia ? ) years preparing Fremen Paul Paul represents intentions control , really Benni Gesserit ? His precients throughout book built knowledge world exists inevitable downfall position unwilling/unable fight . In sense , , novel part horror novel finding monster . So Paul maintains protagonist also monster stop . And general I think accurately reflects realities thing Herbert writing actually comes together . The person needs catharsis n't get , tools used take threat double edged , end even win know reality come win obtained generations manipulation cohersion far dire . In time , Dune scathing criticism types fantasy books world built around ways people bleeding type narrative reality ( fantasy like still gets made people still treat individuals infallible guides sign violent desires I mean , look Trump ) . Cults personality allowing people terrible things without real intention people charge . The ending n't much victory Paul beginning era suffering destruction likes galaxy ever seen . It horror sequence , Paul trapped destiny inevitable outcome destiny Paul already shown us know follows worse systems fighting . ( book series fairly pessimistic taken philosophy , I n't think . I think critique time ways fantasy written ) For personally , reading first book without reading second book like cutting movie halfway thought mid-point twist n't fantasy wanted midpoint . And I would n't really call spoilers Paul tells us happen middle book visions . ",1
4443,"Yeah first part criticism fair , Frank Herbert ’ exactly best entertaining writing . He could explored battles politics , I agree . BUT part Paul Mary Sue ’ less true .

But journey Fremen progresses , simply ’ stop . All step back nope , would prevent genocide entire myth around Paul ’ developed yet . But fundamentally Paul weak-willed character , remains path destruction . Eventually myth around builds Paul ’ visions confirm genocide . So mental sanity , Paul convinces future set stone nothing could done would change outcome . In next book , Paul ’ empire collapsed around , realises future NOT fact set stone , could molded one ’ actions . But peering much future ( Paul ) basically collapses universe , makes future possible outcome . Paul sees one outcome ( I wont spoil ) - apocalyptic event triggered Jihad . To stop , two options : abdicate leave problems children certain ritual severely hinted since book 1 become God-Emperor ( tyrannical ruler ) tens thousands years . The God Emperor path living hell Paul , weak-willed character , chooses easy way abdicates . Much later books basically children cleaning shit . ",1

4522,"I love LOTR Dune . Herbert sparser writing style serves bleak physical emotional landscape story . It feels jarring almost alien terse , I found unsettling manner emphasized tone paranoia tension especially early book . Tolkien writing much richer deeper , conveying depth understanding world people within . The setting n't bleak alien , feels vibrant nostalgic . Both writers excelled came dialogue conveying genuine emotion character interaction . For Dune , moments sincere emotional expression stood bleak backdrop Arrakis political struggles .

They completely change way think Paul Dune universe . Herbert books usually excellent well , well worth time . Try The Whipping Star . I love Lynch movie , people n't . The visuals great , misses point book . Some find confusing , read books n't issues . Enjoy spectacle , ignore rest . The two mini-series relatively low budget , shows .

4549,Welcome Universe Dune ! Enjoy journey . Definitely watch 1984 version ( nearly bad lot people would believe ) 2021 version ( much better 1984 version sure ! ) . Please favor NEVER watch Sci-Fi Channel miniseries ( one Dune one Children Dune ) . They utter crap . And n't listen others say stay away Brian prequels sequels . They obviously written different style Frank original 6 books ( How could written differently ? They 're written decades later originals ) . They still good stories part ( maybe little long winded parts/books ) . But nice job telling back story humanity different Houses original books . ,1

Whenever example science fiction fantasy truly great , disclaimed ( often convoluted , distorted , revealingly insistent arguments ) sci-fi even sci-fi . That SUCKS . It really . It like unconscious conspiracy among literati , bend definition so-called genre fiction make sure contains trite , inconsequential pulp . Once work recognized great , almost automatic effort begins : 're going discuss something * great work * , must start coming ways elevate beyond lowly genre trash . EDIT : This disclaiming sometimes completely transparent , along lines X SO GOOD even sci-fi anymore ! It , like , real * literature ! * As accepted certain level quality compels work ( , importantly , work author ) graduated adolescent pit genre fiction , shining light literary fiction .

After , may tempted read Hunters Sandworms ( books Brian Herbert Kevin J Anderson wrap Frank story lines ; essentially would Dune book 7 Frank ) . Do n't yet . Go back prequels Herbert Anderson , read 3 Prelude books ( House Atreides , House Harkonnen , House Corrino ) 3 Legends books ( The Butlerian Jihad , The Machine Crusade , The Battle Corrin ) .

Many claim world building scope make book epic , I personally find worldbuilding lacks coherence ( eg .

At first I thought I n't comprehending extent I would liked , I read classical philosophy like aristotle xenophon classes , read Steven Erikson Pynchon fun , I realized comprehension n't problem . Things extremely surface level exposition , worldbuilding terms n't bear immediate importance , never referenced , require glossary back book understand . Other series I read , sci-fi fantasy , explained unique concepts lore established worlds within given context make feel natural without exposition , Old Nan use ASOIAF . There two caveats criticisms though : 1 . I read first book . I get things may RAFO , people saying first book best , second third slogs , way would worth reading I thought first slog . 2 . * At time release * I would love book .

I think sequels powerful stories elemental , Herbert tell narrative instinctive mastery . It like lightning bottle moment literature .

He master prose stylist able harness drama inherent Macbeth Hamlet 're devotees book . And larger sense , 're paying buy big powerful books .

IMO tell books Brian Herbert Kevin Anderson wrote using mostly Frank writing started creating books Frank writings . The whole story Butlerian Jihad Sandworms Dune incredible primarily Frank writing . The House books School books seem pulled rough notes lacking Frank flow cohesiveness . That said , books challenge get times . The level detail environment may much interest , political details may turn others , details make books re-readable . I read dozen times get new details time , appreciate time . But like LOTR , I kind speed read sections . As I said many times , I highly recommend reading Frank works outside Dune .

5145,"Dune one all-time favorite series ( yes , whole original series ) I reread regularly , finding something new catches every read . So I would disagree overhyped , though I suppose might better labelled today science fantasy space opera . Those part SciFi though . Is perfect ? No . I think many times Herbert trouble putting words strange concepts trying describe . And sometimes get wordy things like ecology . Still , I feel managed convey sweeping political epic drama intimate personal consequences Paul Team Atreides endure . There nothing typical style Dune series ( n't people copied ) , entire narrative incredible twists turns , often goes directions could predict , overall scope future deep detailed - really get mind blown end much time passed ideas comes future . Everything comes original - Mentats , Bene Gesserit , Tleilaxu , FTL travel , Spice , sandworm life cycle , AI apocalypse , total rejection advanced computers .... Herbert genius . He might get paper exciting entertaining fashion , damn . ",1

Did like book standalone read aside popular ? I . I liked machinations plotting houses one another , liked well developed ecology depth characters . I n't love religion visions felt bit boring overwrought . I n't actually like act reading due sheer amount characters invented words , made getting going tough . The storyline powerful nonetheless .

I really liked story managed interweave science fiction , space travel , diplomacy politics sociology brilliantly . I convinced going best science fiction I ever read , better Foundation series .

5163,"Dune traditional action oriented coming age book one sense . In another , seminal , intrigue , religion , mythology ecology intertwined . A deep strange world building , indeed . Dune Messiah Children Dune take things different direction , less traditional story archetypes . The pacing quite bit different , possibly even slower . Analyze , book liked disliked . That help figure might like succeeding books . The 2nd 3rd go deeper examining myth , destiny , religion politics , worlds behind first etc . It really takes saga different place altogether . Also remember , dune decades change imitators , might fresh wonderful published . FWIW , I started book 2 & 3 came back 1 . And loved .

5176,"No , n't . If n't like * Dune * , n't read others , wo n't like either . What think book often depends large part expected . If hear greatest science fiction novel ever , probably idea means , book n't match idea , fall short . That OK , n't mean 're missing something .

5183,"So I writing someone read original six books multiple times different points life . That said , I definitely get , nothing wrong . The problem definitely book , structured anything like modern fantasy ( dune fantasy , albeit cool ecological tilt ) . I also writing ( joke ) chapter chapter breakdown first book ( interested examine worked book ) First , noticeable book act 1 1/3 book . And full amazing writing , full tension , foreshadowing , character development , worldbuilding . It clear Herbert editor put huge amount effort love part book . Every chapter full gold , promises waiting paid , little nuggets complex relationships characters . It written third person omniscient , nobody uses anymore hard use , top characters geniuses , prompt disbelief issues , works around skillfully believe . But still , 1/3 book , act 1 basically nothing happens ( I defining end act 1 metaphoric bomb goes everything changes ) The stage still set . Then hit I call act 2 ( book 2 internal markings , I think kindof confusing ) point tension built previous 160 pages explodes crazy madcap escape sequence takes next 200 pages protagonist running life something like 2 days finally makes new home fremen . There still decent amount worldbuilding going , first act almost action , part nonstop action , relying foreshadowing development act 1 run full speed without stopping explain anything . Herbert toss sequences POVs give reader break , section focused . It also 40 percent book . But noticeable good number characters act 1 dead sidelined almost second act , time get act 3 fun relationships humanized story mostly irrelevant . Now , could interpret authorial decision mirror growing dehumanization protagonist , either way , two acts feel different . But get act 3 , easily weakest part book I guessing readers . By time get , longer real tension left story . The protagonist entered transformation superbeing . The villains , already executed plan ( successfully ) longer really present much threat mostly sit stationary target waiting defeated inevitable ( entire book foreshadowed within first 20 percent ) . So impotent large time gap years passing n't seem change anything . And really left protagonist take 130 pages wrap loose ends point feel almost hollow , final scene actually bit tense blends everything book built fairly decent emotionally riveting conclusion . If book written today , would n't surprise editor would require third act rewritten . It clear Herbert wrote corner sorts creating protagonist superbeing leading unstoppable army kindof makes hard real stakes tension point . By time reader gets 'book 3 ' seen almost best parts book result , feel kindof like letdown end . ( Arguably Tolkien problem , except reversed . I still gotten rivendell fellowship boring ) ",1
5184,"I loved Dune . My first time reading I stop part way God Emperor Dune , years later I went back reread whole series ( Frank Herbert ) . So opinion differs , believe I say I get . Those books challenging read get downright weird , works brain , completely reasonable everyone cup tea . Out curiosity , read Ender series Orson Scott Card ?

5512,"It well worth checking article : [ https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_science\_fiction ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_fiction ) Between thirties fifties Fiction-Magazines reigned supreme especially Science Fiction . Many novels today remember classics first publication . There 3 important sub-genres science fiction : 1 . Technology obsessed Fiction . Asimov big one course Robot Foundation series . But many science fiction staples like ring worlds example find origin . What share common interested exploring interesting idea tell actual story . 2 . Action Adventure . ( See Flash Gordon ) On high brow side probably count H.G . Wells early days name modern example something like fifth element stories . They indiana jones space , action oriented , technology works - n't think . These stories essentially modern Telepaths tropes see star wars come . In lot basically unreadable guff produced especially fifties reads like coming bad writing prompts . In world everyone mind reader . These bad , Asimov started Robot series robot-stories n't robot uprising ! Not many withstood test time . 3 . The Red Scare - fifties , shapeshifters , mind-control , deep-sleep agents , etc . rise well highly militarized fiction like starship troopers . & # x200B ; But late fifties magazines decline market slowly consolidated . Dune revolutionary , hard time getting published , lot new things , Science Fiction DELETED lot tropes genre . The Butlerian Jihad n't grand invention makes Dune super unique . It almost clunky way Frank Herbert stick line sand say : This technology story ! The entire reason shield - lasgun effect say : This Action Adventure Story ! And politics regressing back feudalism also strictly says : This also Red Scare story . Herbert aggressively replaced many Science Fiction tropes kind biological / evolutionary version one man possibly could . Then took tropes classic colonialist Fiction , shoved far future wrote big allegory oil wars terrible attempts overcoming nature saw governments . With stream consciusness style used describe spice ecstasy struck nerve authors time began use science fiction differently typical magazine fiction . More backdrop , less focus technology grand adventure , put sociological topics spirituality ( gender ) identity embrace surrealism . ( Coinciding similar push film . - > see french new wave ) & # x200B ; Dune - first , forefront dramatic shift genre death science fiction magazine . When comes Themes , Dune heavily influenced media , influence bit aesthetic side . You probably say Star Wars directly stole Jedi Bene Gesserit . Telepaths appeared Dune BG Bio/evolution version , combined whole religious aspect , ease making others obey - influence definitely strong . The following Books : Messiah , Children God Emperor however definitely lasting impact many modern science fiction stories know today . Central Themes Warhammer 40k 1to1 lofted God Emperor . ",1
5514,"My opinion . Before Dune , books would run one two major ideas . 'Foundation ' psychohistory n't branch robots much later . The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress combined two big ideas , AI revolution Moon . He could written entire novel Empire , Fremen , ecology planet . Heck , Sardauker music/drug semutta would enough writers . ",1
5515,"1- Ecology . This ( idea natural world one giant system chemical energy exchange , messing one component unexpected effects another one ) new unfamiliar concept time , new enough I n't even think Herbert used word . To judge contemporaries said , book lot popularize concept though , hippies back-to-nature advocates really latched vision . 2- Society . At time , sci-fi pedestrian scope , best , put together little scenarios 1950s America one thing changed discussion , new coat paint ( eg , housewives get robot helpers , somehow never anything newfound time like go school get job ) . Herbert went way making weird unfamiliar society , even words unknown , still held due internal logic . This rang true things really n't stay long , additionally , lot counterculture already loudly proclaiming needed imagine new ways living , free past , example . 3- Free mind , man . This part maybe n't age well others , mystical lot mind-altering drugs unlock hidden potential concept seriously big 60s ( may heard ) . This actually also goes hand hand item 2 , since one things supposed freeing mind re-imagine society ( although admittedly lot people forgot part ) . * Dune * therefore really nailed zeitgeist respect , possibly even went beyond cautionary note , since lot Paul reshapes society maybe positive ? 4- Post-colonialism , already grasped . The easy gloss spice = oil Arrakis = Middle-East , lot elements baked , since apparently one Herbert big influences actually book Caucasian princes rebelling Russian imperialists 1800s ( Fremen jargon actually lifted straight ) . This , , major shift lot ( , lot ) SF time , stuck 1950s outlook n't take resources lying around ? The natives n't using , besides , thank us civilizing ! I sure people thoughts well , top head . ",1
5516,"The scope Dune world-building largely unknown . While variety science universes considerable development , development largely presented fait accompli . If ray guns universe , story demanded ray guns rather underlying reason technology emerge thrive . Herbert went considerable detail * * institutions formed result history universe . Where science fiction authors traditionally comfortable tinkering boundaries hard science stories , Herbert really tinkering economics sociology physics chemistry . ",1
5517,"Lots good answers . Particularly like note Dune demonstrated SF could exist beyond focus solely interactions humans , society future , technology ( many would tempted argue definition SF ! ) Also worth noting Dune entered scene transition SF predominantly short stories/serials published magazines predominantly full-fledged novels novel series . Partially due , thematic literary depth Dune somewhat new SF . To clear , many complex nuanced ideas previously explored SF , individual work necessity length often limited scope , focusing subset ideas could self-contained degree . Dune able explore complex literary ideas topics tandem , different thematic elements influenced one another - Herbert could plan character arcs plot development tens hundreds thousands words future support . This partly allows Dune overall complexity vibrant , eons- galaxy-spanning worldbuilding . The aspect simply influence . Dune important SF strongly influenced next generation writers . Even ignore everything else , even think rubbish , Dune important reason . ",1
5520,"As late father said Dune Foundation series transcended alot technological gimmicks focused society , politics people . Most sci-fi started lone ranger strange planet stories , always flying car , wanted guess future held . Herbert made clear regardless weapon tech space travel , people politics always problem hand ",1
5523,"I agree lot points brought I like add , since I n't see mentioned , lot popular pre-Dune sci-fi aimed primarily children young adults ( exceptions ) . Dune decidedly adult novel .

Worst case scenario , ends bit much right , OK . Shelf 're ready take another crack , start .

I struck recent reading , . The book front heavy plotting rushes last section book breakneck pace . I think due fact Herbert realized book getting large , especially sci-fi book published 1960s , decided lop final act * Dune * put * Dune Messiah * . Having read series couple times I tend think * Dune Dune Messiah * one story , primary tension Paul moral struggle using prescience avenge family danger becoming tyrant . In opinion , direct commentary themes * Foundation * series , idea grand societal planning prescient forecasting almost fetishized . The ending * Dune * , Paul ascending throne , seen grand event like final plot point second act ( think * Empire Strikes Back * * A New Hope * ) . The final act Paul breaking bonds prescience put upon walking away desert . The precipitating event > ! death Chani , also completes one major plot points original book ! < . * Children Dune * * God Emperor Dune * continue story pick plot points begun * Messiah * really part Paul story ( although play major role ) . The final duology * Heretics Dune * * Chapterhouse : Dune * almost completely ancillary original story ( matter hard Brian Herbert tries create concrete connections ) great fun . I would definitely say continue found first part * Dune * interesting . ",1

These themes forces n't exist vacuum , pull push story powerful interesting ways . One things bugs hero journey books hero triumphs end , obvious , unresolved issues remaining .

5824,I literally picked Dune first time today 300 pages ! Gon na power tonight immediately listen . Thanks much sharing ! ,1
5835,"So , I loved Dune start , I recommended friends none liked one say around page 175 got maybe give till point ? I really liked I could see many sci fi books I ’ read reference Dune . ",1
5836,"The otherness - dropped totally alien culture civilization big selling point . I like working things go Dune great job building goes without much handfeeding lore . I also enjoy feels like synthesis classic Golden Age science fiction rising New Wave SF . It one first perhaps best example blending space opera , environmental concerns , religion , politics human condition . ",1
5841,"I hard time first couple chapters first time I read book , ( mostly I read garbage forced school point ) I could n't tell Herby making words universe potentially referencing objects cultures I personal background knowledge . A prime example talks Reverend Mother Mohiam using knife called ` kindjel ' , poisoned tip . I like wtf 'kind gel ' ? I first read part , I looked I surprised learn real weapon dating back 3rd century BC . As turns several similar sorts real world references almost certainly meant force reader go look actual historic cultures western near eastern history . Once I realized references , became integral understanding world building set first half book . A good article one books significant sources influence found : https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_ ( franchise ) # Middle-Eastern_and_Islamic_influences For , exploring metaphors parallels dune universe made first half book enjoyable part story subsequent rereads . Having said , kind reflection story everyone ideal . My S.O . found chapters focused political intrigue boring , loved exploration Fremen culture struggle survival desert introduced ladder half book enjoyable . Oh And sandworms ",1
5842,"Personally I feel first 3 Dune books seen one book , much like lord rings . The thing really drew Dune much writing first , first book feel clichéd times . Once second book starts though subverts everything thought happening . I think Dune Messiah favourite series . It also accurate descriptions psychedelic experiences I ever read . I always love Dune scope ideas . It philosophy fiction . I think mistake people make 're looking straightforward Sci Fi , Dune . ",1
5843,"I read Dune recently felt way . The world-building impressive definitely slog 're . I also hated Paul found boring , help . I sure I agree commenters gets better . I felt like I waited long plot start soon comes , ends . I heard second book worse action/plot driven ( I plan read yet ) , maybe get Dune , like better . ",0
5844,Reading Dune like drinking tea . People coming book expecting Pepsi energy drink . ,1
5845,"I finished Dune # 1 . I read partner favourite book , I wanted see kept raving However , n't . I ca n't say really badly written , people seem claim . I found writing average sci-fi/fantasy novel . If 're someone prioritises 'world-building ' , quite good . I guess subjective , seems category novels written male authors I never find particularly engaging , including books Hemingway , Dickens , Balzac , Kerouac . They seem share kind 'male gaze ' despite really different books , makes texts impenetrable . It something I feel books written men , example , Stanislaw Lem sci-fi ( author 'Solaris ' ) , writers including Thomas Mann , Flaubert , Camus , make feel way . I come theocratic country women basically rights main value based ability feel intuitively , reproduce bear sons , strategists logicians , I found elements kind worldview 'Dune ' , probably I subjectively distaste . I know time author writing taken account , even looking mid-twentieth century books , books written men seem strongly macho others . I could n't really stand tribute Abrahamic faith book , I vision women holy 'mothers ' bearing messiah sons values politics . ",0
5846,"I guess relatively uncommon opinion , I fan Dune . I would say Herbert best book/writing ( least half dozen I read ) , saying much best pretty middling . I thought setting/universe interesting epic , characters quite boring . I would say Dune n't working n't feel obligated slog - put move something better . ",0
5848,"OP . Dune one overrated books I ever read . subtlety brick , subtlety extremely important comes fiction , especially sci-fi imo ",0
5850,"I love sci-fi I gave Dune 200 pages . Just lot people love n't mean ! Edit add : I issues . Bad writing , flat characters . This plagues lot classic sci-fi . ",0
5853,"I found Dune fascinating . Part fun dropped world understanding language social constructions first . It takes time start understanding , reminds A Clockwork Orange way . Dune starts 100 ’ give much explanation . Paul , mother really , read fairly flat characters training upbringing . Anyways , thoughts . Like others mentioned , get book speeds considerably . ",1
5856,"I n't read much I picked Dune , beginning tough . Every time I lend copy Dune someone , I always warn tempting give lose interest . But book absolutely worth finishing , gets lot rewarding read get exposition . ",1
5859,"I going say thing . I found beginning Dune challenging . I kept comparing game thrones , throwing characters politics proper names . Once scope narrows back Paul Mother , gets good easier wrangle importance already read . I would imagine second read-through would much easier understand role different characters instead getting thrown deep end pool , speak . ",1
5861,"I agree . I would say Dune enjoyed hindsight . Haha . And re-read . I remember forcing way first book I younger eating books . It takes bit get . But yes re-read I start , I enjoy parts probably weird kind boring first time . ",1
5863,"> Dune : The Graphic Novel adapted legendary science fiction author ’ son — Brian Herbert — alongside long-time collaborator , Kevin J. Anderson . Nope , touching anything written two . They stick poorly written fanfiction leave original material fuck alone . ",0
5866,"Right man . It good reputation would believe . It really good points , world building terrible ( seriously , entire galaxy inhabited get three lousy Houses named active ? There less factions Dune Lannister family alone ) , factions neatly black white virtually nuance . ",0
5869,"Ok , I agree Dune overrated , come , Bene Gesserit female Jedi ? Did even read book ? Since Jedi ruthless group eugenicists manipulate world religions get want ? Why I think Dune overrated : world building great , characters cardboard cutouts . Everyone either amazingly noble altruistic gay-coded Evil McEvilface . ( And yes , I know Paul supposed deconstruction chosen one , since hear POV regular people whose lives upended , POV nothing noble intentions humanity , point still stands . ) ",0
5870,"Dune paced well . Its faster towards end detailed seemingly nuanced details start book , drop place assimilate plot threads underpin whole mythos . The history factional in-fighting Landsraad , dynamic C.H.O.A.M Spacer Guild , threads firmly attached first chapters reason . The book primarily focused feud Houses Harkonnen Atreides , subjective context layered subplots political religious intrigue , market forces , eugenics , ecology ethical considerations , subtly meshed together scope magnitude beggars belief . And bizarre Bene Gesserit , female Jedi crack , seriously saying B.G ripped Jedis ? And origin Fremen , Zensunni fanatics , violently opposed Orange Catholic Bible , even important . The whole premise Fremen Arrakis mirror Imperial Prison Planet , Salus secundi . The Emperor crack troops , Sarduakar taken artificially planted population imprisoned harsh , toxic World produce tough , obedient super soldier . The Fremen conditioned harshest environments , whole culture adapted maximise planet valuable resource . Oh , happens known source Spice , without would interplanetary travel . C.H.O.A.M control every planet Landsraad , Imperial Padishah House Corrino rules Landsraad Houses , even access whatever Spice mined Arrakis . And Fremen key everything . And Herbert use Arabic sourced words n't racist . What stayed English ? Nah , English n't prosper deserts . So yeah , course use Arab Bedouin tribes model Fremen , DO thrive deserts . If IS racism Dune , directed towards filthy fucking Bene Tleilax creepy ass Facedancers Gholas . Dune one books I read time time time , I say major stumbling block much details minutiae tie plots together n't even thing first read . The second time I read , year later , almost like I reading completely different book . By third time , I read couple sequels , sheer scope starting sink . All I saying , Dune bitch commit find n't grab immediately . But one Books well worth second read . The extra effort pays pretty big time . ",1
5871,"While I greatly enjoyed Dune ( currently reading one sequels ) I agree points . I specifically agree issue pacing , I found ending bit rushed , could fleshed quite bit . ( get much better 'Dune Messiah ' I currently reading , still quite big leaps forward time ) . I also noticed borrowing 'Arab ' terms aesthetics Fremen , I sure chalking racism correct though ; I read ( maybe kinda cheap ) way underlining desert themes , really evoking desert imagery reader . I disagree points world building characters . > There little context exposition terms supposed mean . Would n't suck fun exploring world every single element makes world unique explained last little detail ? At least fun reading Sci-Fi ( Fantasy matter ) precisely discovering odd elements , trying understand context story . > Ask : could describe Paul personality without describing chosen one , son Duke ? I think point ( one points ) Pauls character human normal psyche ( many characters ) . Paul mentat , human computer , trained birth conduct fully logical conclusions 'input ' ( knowledge , experiences ) . He literally trained factor emotions actions , thus little opportunity emotional growth could manifest actions . Yet still strong emotions concerning future ( ) sees visions struggles greatly ( emotionally logically ) seen . ",1
5873,"> There actually little world-building within first book . It reason first book might held long comparison sci-fi novels , also sequels . The first book really seems focus characters , whereas sequel ( I read * Dune Messiah * started * Children Dune * ) seems ( over- ) invest expanding universe . A similar strength Herbert n't spend lot time combing little detail . The reader really use imagination , I think appeal . We n't spoon-fed minute details , therefore attracted wide audience . > almost none characters character arc . Character arcs compass . The compass help guide character ( ) journey . Sometimes compass n't needed journey . What Patrick Bateman arc * American Psycho * ? What Ned Stark arc * A Game Thrones * ? Does Indiana Jones arc ? Criticizing lack character arcs basically complaining story n't follow strict set rules . The better stories ones break conventional rules . Character arcs cliché , predictable pandering . ",1
5875,"The first Dune pretty cool , context technically grand daddy star wars sci-fi fantasy like warhammer 40k , yeah I agree best story . What always irritated Dune Frank Herbert felt like exaggerated politically socially relevant story . It really n't much commentary anything . So people argue Paul supposed deconstruction chosen one trope really ? Is actually story ? It pretty two dimensional story spread space Islam later n't even bad ( Dune Messiah ) . ",0
5876,"I read five books recently quit 100 pages sixth . The first book actually favorite series ( I think action depth sequels ) books drop pretty quickly . My biggest problem boring , wordy writing style . Massive internal monologues dominate book ; ideas could conveyed sentences sometimes take whole pages meandering thought . There really events Dune , much godlike , practically all-knowing , ultra-intelligent , superhero characters thinking planning events . By time get climax story book , forgotten first place . ",0
5877,"What bugs Dune highly regarded , really good book , people brand new Sci-Fi read think Sci-Fi like , think . How many readers book scare away genre I wonder . The reason bad book distance writing . Everything book feels like 're hovering high everything , like bird satellite . When really characters . The reason , I feel , characters n't fully developed . They archetypes actual living , breathing characters . That also rather dull read . People like book , like environment world building seem cool . So project cool stuff going , somewhere outside actual lines written . ",0

5880,"Dune one pop cultural touchstones one almost afraid say n't like lest seen judged philistine . People worship book almost religious text . I tried reading 3 times life could finish third attempt . Yes , I understand themes . Yes , I understand importance . But end day poorly paced frustratingly structured . Herbert seems love skipping actual interesting things story . It felt like reading dry historical recounting events immersive narrative . ",0

When Paul taken fremen , already white savior ( Kynes ) . He original white savior able implant idea way desert . I guess could call John Baptist-type character . Without Kynes , implied fremen would actually still ignorant savages . Kynes also helped implant idea coming messiah . 2 . The hyper-competency portrayed fremen smells like fetishization culture . Everything fremen portrayed superior city-dwellers . I feel like almost bad portraying ignorant . > What left ambiguous Herbert ( masterful stroke storytelling ) Paul really god-like figure prophecy . The angst character feels taking mantle leads incalculable bloodshed carnage palpable one feels character even one roots accomplish goals lead conflagration . I n't get . The book makes clear repetitive visions future Paul destined jihad . At end story , Paul decides going happen anyway despite attempts stop progression . The decisions Paul makes throughout book n't make sense actually trying stop inevitable jihad , however . I feel Paul end , future-seeing abilities pretty terrible deliberately guided one direction . > critiquing book done understanding comes - yet another ' like must bad ' without understood book .

That 1976 I think . A year later , little movie came called Star Wars I watching , I realized , THIS IS DUNE ! ! In many ways , Star Wars I imagined characters Dune would act look . So , honest , I think discovered Dune way back , would understand much groundbreaking original would picking reading , post-Star Wars movies . For , sci fi book movie characters real , vulnerable human beings could lose eyesight lose limb combat . Dune groundbreaking , original . In way , Star Wars spoiled later generations . Not anything bad Star Wars , I like , I still think Dune progenitor many modern sci fi concepts . ",1

All really need know House Atreides House Harkonnen hate , atomics bad , everyone usually shields order make fighting look cool , Arakkis hard , Spice = cash money .

I tend gravitate dark dense stories without cheesy fluff . Dune story telling heavy beautiful neutral tone . I like , unique . A lot sci-fi literature general fast food approach story telling . Immediate gratification . Dune similar books require bit work reader part . ",1
6128,"Honestly , Messiah favorite three . The ending gave satisfying conclusion Paul . Messiah really stapled back every copy Dune . ",1

I fence Dune I read Dune Messiah , I thought , Alright , Frank Herbert guy serious business ",1
6130,"Well , I inclined say pretty sophisticated son ! I found Dune Messiah far cerebral . The first Dune novel masterpiece storytelling world-building . Dune Messiah , hand , seems kind meditation sacrifice consequences . A different reading experience , although much shorter , requires great deal contemplation reflection . Children Dune , I think , return traditional form narrative story-telling action set-pieces . At least , I remember . ",1

6139,"It dated . The book old I ; however , I think scope world building still hold , themes imperialism/colonialism , religious fanatacism , politics ecology . The book influence almost every sci fi ( even fantasy writers ) writer entire generation inestimable . It virtually created space opera mega-epic .

6141,"I think depends like book . Dune incredibly unique due world building , remarks human nature , discussions politics developed nations rely upon less developed nation ’ land , etc . done gripping prose . That said , slog due needing appendix back understand anything lot monologuing either love like I hate . What ’ deny unique experience find anywhere else IMHO . If looking good plot though , right Dune ’ plot much either secondary tertiary stuff going . Personally , I really love Dune , I generally like books philosophy comes first character arcs come second ala Foundation style . ( Also , fact past 20 years America become oil independent also makes clear oil politics seem archaic front minds . In 60s 70s much relevant much sway readers ’ consciousness . As see I go forever Dune . ) ",1

6154,"Let keep talking Dune . I also want discuss ! I understand whole spice/oil parallel , well real-world parallels Paul religious prophets ( namely Muhammed ) , I n't think handled well could .

6155,"Thanks recommendation . The sequel definitely list . You say Dune stage great drama , full complex interesting characters . THAT something I disagree readily . I n't need characters internally monologuing I , reader , existential crisis every page , though perhaps Dune needs ; Rather , characters Dune n't behave actual human ways . For instance , end whole story , > ! Paul infant son dies offscreen really sloppy uncaring manner authors part , added last minute . Paul shows grief . His wife shows grief . His mother shows grief . The main character feels nothing child died , also feels nothing Freman people child massacred also . The thing almost happened Paul father , whose death Paul expressed greater grief ( save end final line chapters later , simply says Paul cried ) . Paul displays disdainful attitude toward mother giving birth disdainful attitude toward Harkonens ruining life . ! < Again , author n't holding readers hand writes something potentially dramatic . Herbert n't even choose let readers interpret characters grieving secret , behave nothing really important occurred . Frank Herbert decides dedicate couple pages chapter Paul mother fishing survival pack desert dune , character > ! mourning loss loved one ? ! < Nah , important . ",0
6160,"world building n't mean lore dumping information , funny levy Dune Lord Rings Tolkien explains almost nothing setting , record I think better decision almost nothing worse piece fiction author derails narrative talk length toilets work whatever . The increasing videogamification fiction rotted reader brains , imo , reached point people reading dune , sit waiting book tell everything everything world leapt middle . ",0
6161,"As said , point Dune philosophical political positions plot . When think major fantasy/sci-fi novels focus plot character arcs little say human nature political philosophy . In LOTR Harry Potter differences good bad characters obvious stark thus really catch character arcs heroes journey . Dune different kind novel n't heroes journey really kind character arc . It goal say philosophical political idea character arc . ",1

There slow introduction introduces main themes story , quicker introduction characters situation , counterpoint sub-plots , etc . The sonata form : Introduction Exposition ( Usually 2 themes unification theme ) Development Recapitulation The Novel tempo pacing much structured seems first glance . This one reasons Dune great . Herbert sets pace , slower passages give time absorb understand quick passages read . The pace effect way draws world , letting become part mythos . He controls spice , controls universe . ",1

6448,"Dude I . I think dune overrated story I ever read . I disliked reasons , would add : - prose poor - I like authors allow see perspective bad guys hear thoughts , case give away bad guy planning therefore ruined potential twists surprises ( like person betrayed house atreides , cant remember name ) - skipped could coolest part book , part paul integrates fremen culture becomes one . - also thought characters saying/doing things author wanted say/do , characters would say/do , eliminating individual voices ",0
6450,"Dune definitely general audiences sci-fi I think challenging aspects Herbert writing draws certain people . Not liking especially first time engage weird . Dune , book , unlike Dwarf Fortress Crusader Kings videogames . It going appeal everyone , appeal specific hardcore crowd like little else . ",1
6451,"I loved * Dune * I read many years ago . I could hardly put . But n't mean experience . I agree u/BroodingDecepticon , n't like first one n't bother rest . ",1
6452,Dune ’ favorite book I understand someone ’ like . It ’ book everyone I ’ think Frank Herbert intended . ,1
6453,"I read 'Dune ' twice , book 5 , 'Heretics Dune ' bogged . I agree easy read , n't get easier go , I think design . I Frank Herbert scholar long stretch , I felt like first book , maybe even subsequent ones , sci-fi/religious/political allegory . He n't make easy read always writer job make easy , make reader think great thing . I feel like I like books , I revisit years apart , still make think search meaning stories , world I live . ",1
6454,"I agree - I feel like first * Dune * revolutionary * time * , way HG Wells ' * War Worlds * amazing context time written . The supporting characters Dune 2D . The setting interesting analogies Fremen = Bedouin tribes , Paul = prophet/Messiah , Spice = oil , CHOAM = OPEC , encroaching Jihad n't translate well context modern geopolitics . I actually find middle books series interesting ( Children God Emperor ) Herbert explores concepts prescience whether tyranny justified . ",1
6455,"I read book four first . Was confused . Very confused . Thought reading book 1 would help understand 4 . Nope . But . Dune one top 7 books , read year . ",1
6456,"Makes sense - I found Asimov much Herbert opposite style . I personally trouble getting books , I huge Dune fan . Maybe try Hyperion series want give sci-fi another shot . Both buddy huge Asimov fan enjoyed quite bit , maybe kinda treads middle-ground Herbert Asimov . ",1
6458,"That problem dune , I ’ care characters . ",0
6461,"When say Dune , mean 6 books Frank Herbert , right ? In case , yeah , probably find prequels/sequels written son KJ Anderson disappointing . If mean finished first book , got 5 go . The entire story trippy , books better others , I loved overall ideas presented . I read son books , n't * terrible * , n't compare writing style Frank , still missing magic . ",1
6462,"Paul losing humanity one underlying points trying achieve . It makes sense read everything . A lot people n't like Brian Herbert stuff read everything greatest sci fi story ever told . Dune introduction Arrakis , story actually two bloodlines fighting thousands years something trying achieve since left earth . ",1
6463,"Dune , Dune Messiah Children Dune pretty sensible trilogy . God Emperor totally weird awesome , Heretics Chapterhouse also different , enjoyable , especially like God Emperor . I found Chapterhouse disappointing though ends bit cliffhanger never resolved . ",1
6464,"They 're way complex difficult process Dune . So , 're looking simple fun read , stop Dune . If want actually THINK deal fact things complex appear , I think love sequels ",1
6465,"Absolutely ! At least give Dune Messiah shot . In ways I liked first book . Plus nearly long Dune . Also 're cautious commit whole series , stopping end Messiah still makes complete series . But probably wo n't want stop read . ",1
6466,I read three Children Dune favourite . ,1
6467,I think Dune Messiah best book series . ,1
6470,"Dune remember well despite reading decades ago . Dune ? I read promptly forgot . In word , 're forgettable . ",0
6472,"Personally I loved Butlarian Jihad . It Dune prequel written son Brian Herbert . The purists hate I love . I listen audio book least every years . For baseline , Ender Game favorite book . ",1

6481,"I never read Dune , Orthodox Jew totally froze shock I realized someone called thing sci fi book Kwisatz Haderach . It funny circumstances mention , I find using Hebrew terms lot regular conversation usually speaking someone n't Orthodox I would self-censor say sort thing , guy done would never happened : ) It generally lot fun discover people put research comes Jewish/Biblical allusions . One fun one I like Going Postal Terry Pratchett , Moist apparently mentions pep talk post office staff angel another word messenger Mr Pump says many people know . I able feel kind smug I know : ) . ( In Hebrew , word malach means angel messenger . ) Feet Clay Going Postal also really fantastic allusions Golem legends I much appreciated . Then , sometimes annoying . In Life Pi , ship called Tzimtzum , given writer already discussed main character thesis Lurianic kabbalah , fact ship coincidentally called Tzimtzum , key point Lurianic kabbalah , kind took story . ( Tzimtzum contracting ein sof , limitless God , order create room mankind universe . Do n't worry , I n't get either lol . ) ",1
6483,"I loved picking apart religious references Dune . I ’ claim expert I know others . The Bene Gesserit study * pranabindu * . That likely reference Hindu/yoga concepts prana , physically internal energy , bindu multiple meanings including one chakra points . Makes sense intense yoga practice might evolve martial arts practice focused control every muscle fiber body . ",1
6485,You 're really going lot fun God Emperor Dune . ,1
6486,It n't really mean anything . The moral philosophy Dune nonsense . ,0
6487,"I think read books series Messiah God Emperor Dune , ’ glad remembered quotes . Just themes explored even more.You ’ already pretty spot I think though . Truth basis morality . Well I think ’ really talking human beings derive values . Think Fremen operate . To someone another world , fremen may seem like vile uncivilized savages . That people morals . But see evolutionary perspective , Fremen evolved entirely different environment . Their harsh environment means Fremen live different reality , different truth . The things survive shaped morality . This makes think something emerge nothing . Morality emerge nothing , rather reality truth . Thanks posting way . Stimulated new waves thinking one favorite books . ",1

6497,Each wonderful series . Each book giving reader something unique rich . I personally loved heretics chapterhouse much original dune . ,1
6498,"I read Chapterhouse Dune I fifteen ( ~10 years ago ) time I definitely thought God Emperor , Heretics , Chapterhouse trash . Still , actually . I also flabbergasted 're still writing new ones . Like , reading ? ? ? I n't comprehend . I want reread point * * * SPOILER * * * Leto becomes sandworm , series ends . ",0
6500,Never understood hype Dune . Never could get series . ,0
6501,I LOVED Heretics Dune . I feel like Dune incredibly rich series full political intrigue religious critique god I absolutely love flithy kinky series gotten . The fact Heretics Dune felt like arms race create better sex god Duncan Idaho got sex fight Murbella ridiculously magical . And section Lucilla goes details sex techniques . This series become ridiculous insane world painted still brilliant tapestry political economical intrigue . I n't think books got insane God Emperor Dune . That 300 pages Leto II telling everybody smart religion scam . And finally 300 pages plot finally started . God I loved . ,1
6502,Ditto . I ’ read Dune multiple times . I ’ never bothered reread others . ,1
6503,"You keep going . Once start Dune , keep going . I tried couple times make Children , keep going . ",1
6504,"I realize little late moment recommending sci-fi past ever ask read 'Anathem ' Neal Stephenson . The reason I say much like 'Dune ' depth world building simultaneously re-purposing concepts world . However , n't use confrontational manner 'Dune ' ( using charged language like 'jihad ' 'messiah ' rubs many people wrong way ) fact re-contextualizes finer points philosophy theology way allows people re-examine preconceived notions regarding concepts . I honestly think could help friend book club get emotions injected ultimately symbols . When people world hear sounds 'Plato ' 'Aristotle ' 'Kant ' 'Christ ' 'Allah ' whole system pre-configured circuitry lights essentially like trying pull jackpot slot machine already spun came loser . You yell slot machine want already lost moment pulled arm . ",1
6510,"As someone broken 100 audible books , also disappointed Dune . They n't make unabridged cut ton description text . I also read book hard copy . ",0
6511,"This true . I ’ finishing I think twelfth Dune book tape . After half first one tinkly sounds go away voices done narrator . Personally I find work fine , distracting , ’ like started grand plans weeks decided “ naw , ’ good ” ",1
6512,"Maybe Dune maybe n't like personally , also combo different voices strange off-putting music added randomly , honestly I like fuck listening . After reading book shame bad audio version considering epic book . ",0
6514,"Yeah audio hot mess , 're sci-fi I \ * really\ * recommend Dune , honestly one books ca n't wait get back reading get sad 're nearing end haha ",1
6515,"To points - * So Bene Gesserit working many generations breed Kwisatz Haderach 're finally close . They think Jessica daughter combined Harkonnen male final mix . But Jessica son Duke Leto - mainly loves wants son , also hope boy turn KH . The Bene Gesserit mad planned , including complete control KW birth raising certain way . But Paul , control , feels loyalty - screwed plans . * The Missionaria Protectiva Bene Gesserit secret thing , send women influence local legends create similar prophecy kinds worlds - case Bene Gesserit woman ever finds stranded and/or trouble , take advantage status mythology would give . And allows Fremen accept Jessica Paul - though goes whack turns really Messiah Fremen waiting , understanding use advantage . * The gom jabbar test see much control person baser/animal instincts physical reactions . A true human someone strong mental control understanding use reason instinct . * I think Harkonnens made corrupt contrast honor Atreides , demonstrate advanced powerful culture - ca n't much decadence corruption without uprising unless structure supports . Also Baron cunning , wise - Duke wise cunning enough . And Paul gets nth degree ends Emperor . * Paul breaks lot unspoken rules end . Atomics supposed used everyone - blow someone atomics , get blown next point - cancel . But Paul uses make hole shield wall worms get - since n't use people bit loophole exploits . * At beginning book , Paul training Gurney , explain little shields - person force fields major players wear times . The shields repulse object moving quickly - bullets useless . And hand-to-hand combat actually time hits certain speed connect . This part Paul much trouble fight Jamis - n't shields Paul timing . Paul visions future , vague first , lead terrifying ultimate end get glimpses book three ( Children Dune ) explained finally much clearly . He realizes walk incredibly fine line make sure horrifying outcome one creates . The jihad , even though knows terrible thing , really lesser evil choices , leaves open small window hopeful future outcome . You wo n't get unless read God Emperor beyond though . I sure much worked Herbert wrote first book - I suspect much . I think jihad meant book 1 commentary power religion become out-of-control wildfire used like - manipulation politics . I hope might clarify things go read sequels eventually re-read Dune truly amazing universe Herbert created books . ",1
6516,"Continue journey . There many books trek fully understand story begun . Paul neither beginning end intriguing mid point start . The sequels prequels dealing origin Butlerian jihad amazing . Read prequels last though , explain abhorrence machines , Genesis bene gesserit , fremen , mentats much . The dune universe one revisited digested sections . Happy journey ! ",1
6518,"Try remember Dune series , much plot characters secondary philosophy . I would argue ratio philosophical treatise plot higher Dune books even Battlefield Earth series ( helped start entire quack real-world religion , Scientology ) . Start simple concept : small segment population ( Bene Gesserit ) able pass memories one generation next ? Time becomes meaningless . They begin think far grander ways typical humans , make plans involve centuries carefully breeding perfect individuals . They learn control every muscle bodies , realize sexual power gives men , foolish fall love . What power would people ? How would plans evolve millenia ? Would betterment society , keep lineage control ? If , mind , could see results actions 4000 years hence , would act ? Would others every able understand actions , could even attempt explain mere mortals ? I think surprised next book . And yes , worth keep reading . ",1
6519,"I think Dune greatest work Human literature , past , present , future . And doubt anyone outside alien species , could possible forge something surpassing wrought Dune The Religions , Planetology , Philosophy , Prophecy ; amazing . As question Jessica bearing son bad , , yes , kind unfinished , importantly meant girl could wed Harkonnen heir bring peace two long standing rival families Landsraad ; instead , son , union possible led downfall Houses ..

6520,"Big fan , read series times , read Dune . I would encourage continue reading series , lots come . Lots things get rounded continue . If get chance want re-read Dune completing series , I think enjoy even . ",1
6523,Curious see I one - I got Children Dune stopped Leto realizes golden path . That ridiculous . ,0
6524,"Personally I loved God Emperor , seems love/hate-book ? ( Chapterhouse Dune favs tho ) ",1
6525,I loved children dune . The golden path felt like hokey name first represents many things . It shows us Leto hubris immaturity also prescience . God emperor dune gave issues first go around . I felt * infinity readers head explodes . * But fair I rather young first time I read . ,1
6527,"They anywhere level master like father , huge strays away direction Herbert taking huge extrapolations I personally feel like highly dumbed beauty Dune complex shifting landscape . ",0
6528,"I read three prequels first , starting old Paulus young Leto caladan , I currently reading children dune . I regret nothing . People talk lot shit , I think part character development adds lot depth books . Some I n't fan . Fenring . Rhombur . Some things Leto . But duncan , gurney , harkonnens , jessica , shaddam , etc lot momentum going first book . Dune masterpiece . But honest I book three I n't think prequels complete trash compared Frank books . They obvious childish , I liked . People act like Frank son literally whoring legacy , I think unfair . ",1
6529,"I loved GE . Hated Dune Messiah though . I n't know happened , always felt like Herbert published draft outline . All books fully fleshed except one . ",0
6531,"Oh man , favorite . Dune , Dune Messiah , God Emperor Dune greatest . It interesting see different people feel books loved series . ",1
6533,"The intricacies characters motivations , political intrigue , moral dilemmas ( specifically Paul ) makes Dune great . By time get conventional big battle climax almost unnecessary . The ending I think want comes climax final book series . ",1
6534,I fucking love Dune . ,1
6536,Dune much meditation politics religion ; read read story action adventure completely misses point . It would like reading Starship Troopers simple war story . ,1
6537,"I agree ending feel rushed . If read lines atomics storm . First massive storm second natives sandworms . Beyond though water life ( changed water ) posed makers . If drop would destroy entire ecosystem point would longer spice , stranding every planet guild . Now said yes story ends entirely quickly . But already eight hundred pages adding another one hundred two hundred seal would bit disappointing especially Paul completely . The side could almost nothing point . A hundred pages victory lap would worse quick account settlings . The thing I wish went country fenring ( forgive wrong name I phone ) . They drop failed quizera hadrack ( sorry definitely wrong ) n't say failed , really define , even says failed still alive . To I love dune . The end good entire book fantastic , least Frank Herbert parts series continue greatness . Though I say third book went bit long way made appreciate brevity first book . To made great instead inept enemies enemies heroes fully understand dune produces groups factions proven competent , skilled , dangerous feel like could win , even predictions well made plans . In fact consider first fifty pages Baron Harkonnen practically lays entire plan book . So books daring enough even well enough honestly believe solid chance winning . Even though sides good ideas opponents plans see back forth full scale combat . ",1
6538,I always thought Dune sci fi retelling Lawrence Arabia . I liked book overall thought books great job tying first . It n't feel rushed context series whole . My favorite one God Emperor . ,1
6539,"I loved original Dune series , though I found God Emperor little dry taste . I also enjoyed two books Herbert son wrote finish series , I read understanding Brian n't father . I n't read prequels , though I . Hmmm It time another read I think . ",1
6540,I enjoyed first Dune Then eagerly read second utterly disappointed . It horrible . I third n't bothered read . ,0
6542,"I would recommend research publication book . I read Messiah Dune initially supposed supplement later editions Dune . If read whole makes sense . It also deliberately skips massive battles flashy details . Also I amazed complain certain things without seeing biased film deals narrative ! Dune n't film , even less summer blockbuster knows climactic battle n't forced publisher expectations . When Dune published * * 1965 * * little terms sci-fi know today . There absolutely nothing series resembles grandiose scale seem expect . It story politics , religion characters involved grand events . Not huge space battles . Besides read ending obvious nukes tear wall let storm . The storm neutralizes shield static electricity shields Fremen warriors riding Sandworms short work Sardaukars . While somewhat cliche makes perfect sense book . After - earlier book - assault Imperial Sardaukars repelled Fremen * women children * . ",1
6544,A lot criticism Dune responded read second book . That say n't real criticism series . It ca n't take Dune . It relies rest books heavily . I tell everyone read first 3 books judge . You would n't want judge Star Wars Episode 1 . ,1
6545,"> A lot criticism Dune responded read second book . I agree , I actually think part problem series . I wish first book slightly self-contained . Herbert writes everything hidden last minute , frustrating times reader feels completely lost misled unsure going payoff patience . When people tell wait third book I immediately suspicious , I told I invest lot time I even tell worth effort . I guess I fear reading bad book series I could reading good one instead . edit : formatting ",0
6547,"I get totally . I okay reading 2 books I know payoff coming . 3 makes weary . Thankfully , second one really gets series going . I always tell people Dune trilogy extra novels hardcore fans . ",1
6549,"Thanks mentioning Comic Book Girl 19 , I never heard knew Dune guide/chapter analysis like YT . This exactly I looking I begin Journey Dune Messiah . ",1
6550,"You absolutely need read * Dune Messiah * soon . It intimately connected * Dune * forms part story . * Children Dune * list soon , well . The Frank Herbert-only books also worth reading , * God Emperor Dune * read separately . * Heretics * * Chapterhouse * form single story , read two together , . ",1
6552,Definitely read Frank Herbert Dune books . I would read prequels sequels son Brian Kevin J Anderson . They add quite bit story round things . People say read I say . Their writing style different ( course ) lot ways better ( opinion ) . I found writing somewhat easier understand . Frank stories LOT dense subject matter sometimes difficult ( ) get . ,1
6555,The spice must flow ! I ’ definitely going venture deeper Dune books ! I want know happens next ! ,1
6556,"Personally I ’ audiobook would pain stop audiobook look words . I ’ best audiobooks either , I ’ listened I usually find mind wandering . Personally I read , googled word I ’ know I ’ keep going appendix helped lot . Also Dune Club Comic Book Girl 19 YouTube literally saved . Her enthusiasm palpable makes love able break section ( 50-60 pages ) makes much easier I CANT recommend channel enough . It vital personally . Also things start getting way cooler chapter 3 ! I also ’ get hardly spoilers googling term like Bene Gesserit takes dune wiki page type odd words I believe gives definition I understand wanting spoilers ! ",1
6558,"That ’ awesome ! I ’ glad I could convince . I stopped last month 45 % I picked back days ago stayed 5am today finishing ( watching dune clubs videos YouTube helped tremendously , like I CAN NOT recommend enough get better idea ’ happening amazing breakdown every chapters .

6559,"The political plot gets much deeper series goes imo . The first book , great stand alone , really sets whole series . And I understand deathly bored . Dune n't everyone , book . If n't grab chances next five wo n't either . ",1
6561,"Man , series moved list . After I finish Dresden series I sure I fall massive hole Dune ",1
6562,"Reading post gave serious flashback I first discovered * Dune * back early days high school . I always fan science fiction , devouring classics contemporary work mad rush familiar * everything * . And people telling book called * Dune * . It different , insisted . How ? I would ask . They would nod say I would get I read . I watched Lynch movie enamored visuals epic-ness Toto soundtrack . Interesting , I thought . The voice-overs curious cultural cues ( Jihad ? Mahdi ? Bindu ? Zen ? ) . I n't know I understood half going . This may may adolescent brain crushing Sean Young . It may incomprehensibleness editing . I picked copy local bookstore ( Amazon crushed becoming All-a-Dollar ) . I remember feel slick black cover hands . The feel smell mass-market paper . This sci-fi . And I started reading . * Dune * different sort sci-fi . It book standing delicate edge eras . It foot wiz-bang adventure stories Golden Age pulps fifties early sixties . It also foot post sixties era sci-fi pose difficult questions nature sci-fi question underlying assumptions ( Is Messiah good thing ? How ecology shape people people seek shape ecology ? ) It also book direct conversation classic works Asimov * Foundation * works ( book store human memory control plan seen necessary saving humanity , * Dune * series things part problem ) . It immensely satisfying adventure story lot mind . I happy discovered . ",1
6563,"I finished first one ( hour past , actually ) . However , dipping toe Messiah I suddenly realized actual conclusion Dune lacklustre . Everything sort came head final hundred pages Frank Herbert dragged everyone Arrakis final showdown ( ? ) . I enjoy slow boil Dune seemed going route . For suddenly flash-fire surprising . Exciting , doubt , lasted , left hollow end . Freyd Rautha built philosophical antithesis Atriedies way life ( therefore Paul , straying father path ) , Emperor tragic god-figure pulling strings behind scenes ( portrayed another counterpoint Paul ) , course Benne Gesserits Guild shadows manipulating things behind scenes purposes ( hinted heavily first half book ) . Then Count Fenring ends nothing foreshadowing . But ride comes abrupt end see mental sparring Freyd Rautha Paul . None growth teaching Baron Harkonnen alluded Freyd gaining handing reins . Their rivalry ended moment meet , fistfight . Both Harkonnens : foil Atriedies : gone . All aforementioned forces topple quickly first recorded battle ( first one Frank Herbert actually wrote us experience ) first planet galaxy-spanning empire . The emperor offers little resistance save petty assassination attempt , betraying fear rest characters throughout first half book . The Benne Gesserit Mother goes rabid . The guild capitulates . In beginning , A-list cast obstacles . At end , bunch goons . And frustrating Dune started strong . I erudite writing . My favourite arrangement words Robert Jordan Wheel Time series , Dune places outdid . tl ; dr last 100 pages , villains suddenly came together , lost easily , book ended quickly . Then I googled bit seems like Messiah ( 100 page addendum even ) contains true ending first book , Children begins new duet climaxing God Emperor . It feels messy . I continue reading though . Maybe part master plan , I fool end . ",0
6564,"I read Dune first time last year . I amazed complexity world Herbert built layers intricacies political landscape . As I reading , I learned Missionaria Protectiva meant related Bene Gesserit Fremen mind blown . So cool . I definitely recommend reading Dune Messiah . It much shorter acts nice epilogue first book .

6565,"I read first three books Dune year two ( three , ugg ) ago . It special kind wormhole pulls kind tea . Books 1 2 really one long story best taken together . Highly recommend read 1 fresh . ",1

6568,"I could n't agree . I halfway Messiah . I actually like Herbert writing Jordan/Sanderson . I feel like page substance vs unnecessary details people breast lace , time lot I thought foreshadowing Dune ended nothing . I trying best pay attention plotting , ended naught . So end , WOT wins better book foreshadowing plays . Both weaknesses . ",1
6573,I read Dune first time year well . The setting absolutely amazing - certainly competes Star Wars makes top-tier sci-fantasy universe . I liked plot well felt like essentially given early story prophecy foreshadowing n't many surprises unfortunate . I also liked lot characters except Paul simply seem good everything - I think hypercompetence n't handled best devalued character arc mind . ,1
6575,"I book idea rolling around head years I desperately wanted write chronicles far future mankind shows greed corruption hijacks ultimately kills social technological progress .

Then market books shrank drastically advent graphical computing things became bad Patrick Kinsella obtained assisted suicide physicians bestselling novel would never published today . I personally feel Frank Herbert good writer . He ambitious ideas , bitter tradeoff taking boosterspice involved , n't talented capable enough bring ideas life .

6636,"It n't . Herbert tried create novel characters smarter , failed . Once get , , God forbid , try books , notice slow , little said ca n't condensed couple paragraphs . There endless rehashing concepts , Herbert telling us already know . Lots pointless dialog presented high debate intrigue ( e.g . Alia Irulan , start * Children Dune * ) . People absurd , totally unexplained things pretense genial reasoning , actually keep reader guessing plot . The Bene Gesserit kindergarten dialectics . The handwaved societies , feudal , decorative , implausible Imperium Fremens . The absurd technology : man dark stilsuit , desert sun , water evaporation cooling , would bake like potato . So , never gets better . ",0

Just spent long ass time writing story , seemingly unconcerned whether reader liked not._x000D_ _x000D_ If nothing else , later books make good political discourse .

If keep reading let say one point lot things escalate quickly . What I love hard say without spoiling . But short Fremen awesome probably know Dune delves deeply spirituality point . That I enjoyed . ",1
6692,"I think Dune described sci-fi LOTR . As someone loves Dune could never get LOTR - yes , tons world building , slow hell , oh dear god pointless songs ! I recommend cheating . Try movie miniseries ( even old games ! ) . The movie great , put mildly , ending makes zero sense . The miniseries better , budget limitations clear . That give plot , get know characters , idea world weird concepts . Then go back enjoy book without wading weird shit . ",1

6698,I would highly recommend checking audio book Dune 're struggling reading . They bring fantastic voice actors use sound effects really help world building . ,1
6699,"Dune absolutely amazing book , super dense . If want better understand , I suggestion : watch movie first . You watch David Lynch version , Sci-Fi mini series . Either work . Neither great , Lynch veers pretty heavily source material , matter . They get door . They introduce world , politics , tech much shorter time frame . If still intrigued , book MUCH digestible .

The way Herbert approaches prescience combination total knowledge past ( ancestral memory ) perfect empathy ( Bene Geserit training/the voice/weirding way ) complete logical/rational rational understanding cause effect ( Mentat training ) give Paul unique ability combine traits consequently 'predict ' course events far future . Herbert never comes says people assume spice magic yo ' . Spice device books whereby limits cognition removed results explored . The theme throughout arc story exploration limits human mind . For , inspiring whole thing . On top notion 'scattering ' ensuring survival humanity inevitable destruction immensely satisfying piece together . When really grok characters motives goals , story goes intriguing epic . I wished Frank Herbert n't died resolving climax occurs Chapterhouse : Dune .

Brian good enough author could write series , try ? The events ideas prequels could easily altered cool new sci-fi story , keeps cranking Dune stuff . Finally , I n't believe Brian Kevin Anderson 100 % honest Frank notes . In response fans criticizing way series ended , posted picture box labeled Dune notes .

They also used proxies notice things something another character said , like deeper double meaning , basically plant flag . This helped slow re-read certain sections try notice thing character .

7052,"The Dune prequels actually quite amazing providing full rich universe reading first three Frank Herbert Dune novels .

I enjoy , ’ good deep original books . ",1
7066,"Frank Herbert writing amazing . The attention detail without pacing issues book size Dune undoubtedly rare . As others mentioned . The next two books par first . They 're outstanding . Books four six start follow downhill slope . Characters plot get outlandish gimmicky . Honestly feel Herbert trying push end saga . ( There GRRM argument , time place . ) The expanded Dune universe , written son Kevin Anderson good details factors previously explained first six . The Butlerian Jihad , Sardekaar , etc . The writing dry , paced like licking tarred sandpaper . I recommend unless want knowledge universe . ",1
7069,"I would really recommend read sequels push Dune messiah later ones , definitly worth time . I may bit biased though God emperor dune favorite book time . Enjoy reading first time ",1
7070,I would recommend giving children dune try . Messiah seems fairly controversial book . Youuare spot post though books continue theme throughout series . A lot people consider Messiah low point series children dune fantastic imo . I loved whole series opinions seem vary wildly books except first . ,1
7071,"I also liked Dune Messiah least , time I read , gets better better . And please read whole series Frank Herbert , Children definitely better Messiah , God Emperor Dune Heretics Dune mind blowing . ",1
7072,"Yes , issue , little bit like Clockwork Orange : start ca n't understand single word , keep reading end book understand everything . This , plus fact end book ( least edition I got ) entire vocabulary Dune . That sure great help I n't able figure meaning word way ",1

7074,"They n't . They n't ultimately series never finished , 're left brutal cliffhanger never explored . By end Chapterhouse , series goes almost full circle learn last Tleilaxu Master , Duncan current position , mystery surrounding aging couple visions . You read much take metric shit tons information characters wind trapped precipice coming storm never hit never resolved . But It worth reading 're invested characters enough continue . I could n't stop . Most people ask tell stop book three , even say read first book call good . I see say , ultimately . But possibility 're sucked universe stopping option . Where story goes I found cool . I liked Darwi Odrade Miles Teg . I thought Honored Matres coming Scattering really cool . The goings Chapterhouse cool . It building wild climax Old Empire HM , also something else . Kralizec one book away . The Typhoon Struggle fulfillment Golden Path . So yes , end , I would say read . Dune , Messiah , Children often referred best ones . I second , Messiah favorite . But 're gon na get series deep , thought provoking , lined every sentence information subtle pacing favor read . ",1
7077,Massive Dune fan . The 1st book amazing . Read 2nd want finish Paul story . If still hooked see happens kids . If lose interest 3 might enjoy rest books . Many people n't go past Dune fine . They amazing books . His son books get alot hate really n't THAT bad . They alot action packed . That feel I 5th grade reading dune wishing I could ride sandworm mentat friends wanted jedi ....... ,1
7080,"Sorry reviving 7-year old comment , I reading Dune first time . I struggled getting first chapters n't grab interest . Then soon actually hit Arrakis I hooked . It world grabbed I think , characters . Paul okay . Honestly , character sometimes feel like emo-kid power-fantasy I actually surprised I n't find aggrevating . Still , I find Kynes Jessica much interesting characters people far . Would recommend reading first novel ? ",1
7081,"You 're getting probably dense series ever written . You find information almost every line text book . It take awhile get feel one book , let alone entire series . Things like Missionaria rumination makes man man , animal . The situation Paul finds , choosing path takes . How heavy head wears crown , sacrifices made help humanity survive coming onslaught . I would say boring ( I use term loosely ) book series 4 , God Emperor Dune . Much discussion explanation motivates characters must done . Reading series completely open eye almost necessity much going within single paragraph focus literally every word . I read books literally 20 times least I go back I still catch little tidbits I missed times . So yeah dude enjoy . It probably greatest book series ever written sic-if history . ",1
7083,"Took years make first Dune novel . I enjoyed every failure I started reread n't put clicked . The Silmarillion cake walk comparison Dune Messiah least , I n't read third yet , enthralling . ",1
7084,"My view Dune extended universe n't negative perhaps think . I found first time I read I younger , I went expecting shown mark science fiction history could breach gap time thus feel potent father . I find I take good deal enjoyment realising sensations fiction . I want feel wind , clammy sucking sensation survival suits skin , wonderfully coloured silks cottons galactic nobles draped exotic fashions . I found appearance people world reminded prologue second volume The League Extra-ordinary Gentlemen ( comics , atrocity film ) introduces Martians tripods inhabitants Red Planet taken works Edgar Rice Burroughs . It struck point , alongside understanding spice properties I read book , Dune n't genuine science fiction . Under broad definitions , certainly counts . However inspection , whole premise science fiction take wonderfully incomprehensible give rational explanation . The works Arthur Clarke Asimov stand regards fathers modern science fiction , opposed H.G . Wells Jules Verne grandfathers . Clarke spent much literary career findings entertaining plausible explanations fanciful phenomenon occurs work . Herbert comparison spends much time lavishly portraying illustrious world , resorting blind faith spiritualism dispel scepticism core mechanics behind much anything . Dune n't strictly science fiction , * future fantasy * . Now I saying n't meant taken criticism , supposed isolate fact Dune , nothing really able work . Instead , comes together tell remarkably vivid exciting story , story deeply fallible nonsensical . Perhaps chemical addiction certain compounds within spice might add large omega-3 supplement mentat diet , would n't give raise cognitive brilliance . Nor would copious consumption award clairvoyance women , ability percieve universe way enables smooth faster-than-light travel aid navigator intuition . It wonderfully inventive fantasy , asinine make-believe get right . I found I learned Dune story much investigation continuation possible without task actually reading rest , I came understanding I going continue enjoying tale much I first , I would suspending disbelief ad nauseum . I give free pass works fantasy fiction , I n't know . At times I scoff implausable acts even , I think Dune would pushed limit . I read first book , enjoyed , since I gone entirely different approach tastes sci-fi . I took much fancy Culture series . At least works Banks , makes riveting argument intergalactic civilisations made leap . He even wrote book specifically hyper-inteligent machines coming terms anomaly encountered space defied laws physics , done . There pseudo-intelectual philosophy . People Bank work curious flawed , redeemably professional . It work hard , play hard . After Dune , I started feel bit demoralised Paul stern behaviour absence character , character flaws matter . Really Baron able followed enjoyed , desires vices careful eye reading people . I hope I made thoughts clear . I mean ill whatsoever towards Dune . I found delightful diversion time I read , small part recently actually thought reading , see opinions would change , I n't feel I right set tastes get enthusiastic reading books . The plot Dune could self-contained satisfying conclusion . That I feel anyone needs care . Star Wars fans n't need read Thrawn trilogy keep identity fans original work . ",0
7085,"I finished Dune ! Wow , great read . The shift Machiavellian power struggle Messianic stark n't feel unnatural . I think I loved books 2 3 Dune even book 1 . I n't gotten Dune Messiah yet I quite busy , low cash , I got many books already I n't read yet . Currently reading Heart Darkness first time ( also amazing ! ) . I intend get Messiah though , probably Children Dune eventually well . But probably I stop I think . ",1
7088,"Different strokes different folks , I guess . I love stories massive , detailed world ; lots factions ; protagonist ’ centre world . Part fun figuring fit together relate . Dune scratches itch . It probably stands less publication , unique groundbreaking . I ’ sure I re-read Lord Rings I might find less amazing I first read , reason . I always factor kind “ This book one pioneers books ’ read ” viewpoint . ",1
7092,"I also big sci fi fan , like I found dune tough read . Overall I would say worth reading , desire continue series . ",1
7093,"Dune extremely character-focused story . It ’ basically character study Paul . It ’ going everyone , slow action-packed . You ’ necessarily meant like anyone , understand . It took two attempts get first time clicked I fell love . Not everything ’ like ‘ overrated. ’ People like like , dislike . Not every story style writing appeal everyone , ’ okay . ",1
7094,Did everyone agree read Dune recently something ? I literally finished Dune last night . I decided read hype new film coming end year . It tough read get due terms made story I stuck 'til end interesting ideas I get writing sometimes .

7095,"Damn , people thread pretty bad taste . Read Dune HS fel absolutelyl love . ",1

7098,"Dune kind ends cliffhanger , still feels complete . You perfectly happy one book story Paul involuntary exile return . I love . ",1
7102,"Personally , I think Baron worst point story . He evil point parody . He obscenely fat , much described grotesque . Oh , also happens pedophile . But pedophile , pedophile lusts nephews . The dude kind evil villain delights evil always exceptionally boring . The chapter orders Feyd-Ruatha murder harem slave girls punishment worst chapter book , Ah shucks Uncle , I sure love slave women . His presence novel annoys . I fine absolute evil . It works well something like Lord Rings . But part reason works Sauron presence felt everywhere , actual character reader become familiar . It also n't help majority novel spent Fremen subjugated Harokkens . So , atrocities Harokken family committing denizens Dune implied , 're really felt . They sure super duper evil . We n't get see . It ’ like writing evil character way exposition . His presence book n't detract * * much recent reading Dune . It fun read , great villain . ",0

7108,"For Dune much sci-fi fantasy philosophical . Also , book one kind prologue rest series . ",1
7109,"Dune acquired taste , I think one things either get n't . I grew kind Dune ecosystem media , I think helped . I played original PC games , watched Lynch movie saw mini-series . And eventually tackled book , I grew . The thing I find powerful , scope , left imagination . The story great , left unsaid , unexplored , keeps thinking . Other planets , houses , cultures , relationship lack thereof spice , fuel imagination . Instead writing prequel novels , n't well received , I wish written stories set locales Dune universe . There much explore one titular planet . ",1

7127,You get best sense closure reading nothing except first book . Which I consider high watermark smoke mirrors method fantasy world-building . It glossary best part I mean mean way . Dune glossary better reading main bodies 99 % SF novels . ,1

The history Butlerian Jihad sketchy novels , followed historical framework left behind . KJA : The Star Wars Expanded Universe huge history I pleased contribute much ( 54 projects , count correct ) .

7170,"I one readers Dune really liked series whole ( ones written Frank Herbert ) . The first book stand , I think people like , n't lead series , someone liked story Dune n't want continue exploring universe could stop right content . In opinion , second Dune book , Dune Messiah weakest 6 , could another reason many people read first book . I thought series went philosophical questions keep coming , strange ones emerging , I found interesting full 6 books . That said , books different go like Paul different end book 1 . ",1
7171,"I also one disenchanted rest series , I prefer story-driven books rather philosophical litanies . That said , Dune Messiah n't bad , I barely got Children Dune . Good luck : ) ",0
7172,"None books recreated spirit first book , closest The Children Dune . I read prequels , Butlerian Jihad good interesting , rest failed contradicted facts originals ( example , originals stated Paul never left Caladan trip Arrakis , negated prequels ) . ",0
7174,"The rest series different . The first book pretty basic hero journey unique setting . Then second book pretty much antithesis . Most series focused philosophy character development , I think people apt overlook wrapped cool story desert people overthrowing government . If read Dune like , definitely try sequels . ",1
7175,"In Dune * things happen * pretty consistently throughout book . The sequels gradually move towards pattern nothing whatsoever happening first 75 % book , followed one totally amazing SHtF scene want see ends soon , amazing things love know happening camera , reported second-hand . All make room galaxy 1 % sitting around total luxury ( least compared normal people ) going ad nauseum think human nature . Also , sex gets weird . And fun way kinky way . By end series even protagonists like , kinda need sexually assault minor bit . ",0

There pockets resistance cabals course , lot readers jarred fact lot changed since last saw Paul . Everyone know different today 15 years ago . * Children Dune * follows relatively shortly * Dune Messiah * probably readers 2nd favorite book . All I going say * God Emperor Dune * pivots pivots hard . I n't consider much spoiler get good idea much different first 2 chapters book . * God Emperor Dune * probably polarizing book series .

7188,"By sheer coincidence , I finished re-read first book morning . I introduced Dune 1984 film , greatly enjoyed 2000 Sci-Fi miniseries 2003 follow-up . ( I week decided , I enjoyed Saskia Reeves Jessica former , Alice Krige Jessica latter feels much book-accurate . ) It point I finally read Children Dune book . Yes , order . Which I liked quite bit . Much later I finally read Dune , I completed first re-read . For , two things make Dune compelling : strongly motivated characters ( particularly Paul Jessica ) ; well-developed themes . I glutton themes . I actually rank theme ahead plot character , terms importance enjoyment . I disagree author thematic conclusions cows come home , story good job presenting themes , favorite thing whole world . Specifically : I . Love . Dune . But everyone , okay ! Ignore downvoters . Not everyone cares themes much I , _wrong_ way read work fiction , bring read frankly unlimited diversity life experiences . Infinite Diversity Infinite Combinations , fellow Star Trek nerds say . Anyway , big theme I identified read-through : > Which preferable ? Doing cruel-but-right thing , compassionate-but-wrong thing ? broken two big sub-themes . One : > When use detailed knowledge world consequences achieve results behave humans , Bene Gesserit would put sometimes discard agency others , cruel , oppose animal passions , including compassion . Is necessary , acting human times , never giving animal nature even human way cruel one ? Are Bene Gesserit right , consequently Paul right ? Two : > Predictability leads peace , also stagnation death ; unpredictability leads cruelty , also change life . Can ever peace life ? Must always choose , must always choose life consequently cruelty ? I love . These _big_ thematic questions , 're well-developed multiple examples woven plot setting . I disagree almost every word !

7205,"Definitely read , start first book . The Dune universe compared Tolkien LOTR world depth richness ( although I think Herbert n't go quite lengths Tolkien , like making entire languages detailed family trees , ) .

Frank great job make immersive interesting . Westwood actually made dune cnc style game 1992 .... made command conquer 1995 . I would argue Dune sandworms inspired whole generation real time strategy games , though already board game '79 . Many great science fiction gets turned movies/games concepts story elements strong . Few strong sandworms desert people come often works . ",1

There possible way Jurassic Park described book could constructed , EVERY single aspect park designed fail fail-deadly methodology possible . And ignoring impossibility lot stated aspects . * * Programming * * In book , reason Nedry pissed Hammond engaging Industrial Espionage Nedry company bid Hammond Automated Amusement Park contract , almost zero information provided bidders . That right red flag right , matter good seem matter actually military-classified construction project , still mountain information provided contractors bidding purposes otherwise zero idea much bid . Is amusement park tiny side-show attraction million hugely much ? Is amusement park largest planet million would n't even cover cost setting server environment code ? After winning contract , Nedry asks information told . His company required build software run every single aspect one larger amusement parks planet literally information . Even number rides , much less specific electrical/mechanical equipment involved information n't allowed . So Nedry fit sanity said backing . But Hammond threatens got world billionaires behind make sure Nedry everyone works never get another job kind rest lives backs . So Nedry makes deal going move island isolated till park opens SINGLEHANDEDLY code entire park on-site . Now , alone impossible feat , boils one aspect park worked . To keep track population dinosaurs , cameras ( insanely good image recognition , I digress ) ask Is X number Y breed dinosaurs ? . In effect , written If LEAST X number Y breed dinosaurs , say yes. . I know single programmer alive would program system like even accidentally . WORST case , counting system finish counting , ask Is X == numberOfDinos ? . And BEST case , given system question goddamn command-line interface , actual output would Number Dinos Found : X , Number Dinos Sought : Y . maybe additional yes/no declaration somewhere . In sane world , possible way single human could possibly programmed park depth required would used automated methods code writing never actually go back fix INEVITABLE bugs lack tuning . Which means park falling apart Grant others even showed . * * Electrical * * Later book park actually entirely recovered . The T-rex tranqed raptors , mending fences , etc . But park still fails main power shut backup system method informing ANYONE active minutes away shutting . And main power system ? According Hammond We never wrote turn , never supposed turned off. . Fucking WHAT ? ! There contractor planet would capable building sort power plant systems Jurassic Park needed would install system leave without handing documentation system built . The liability opens mindbogglingly huge . They would n't ALLOW refuse documentation . Not mention systems built standards , codes , etc . Even pointed contractor Hey ! We 're autonomous island , n't need ! , guess ? They still book ( way projects ) simply would take effort NOT . Power systems something taken seriously quality company capable setting park like .

He reasons way park staff provide proof matter minutes . As lecturing , man lecturer . I know plenty people like . n't make one-dimensional .

Crichton / Malcolm point way science works allows us learn new knowledge faster learn responsible . The fact capitalists pushed little harder scientists wanted go irrelevant . The point way science works building blocks building blocks . Nobody learn everything scratch . Everyone builds work predecessors . Standing shoulders giants . And end nearly godlike powers child sense responsibility . The scientists capitalists quibbling details . The point science came easy , nobody learned use responsibly . ",1

7765,I read reread Jurassic Park middle school fell apart . ,1
7768,"I actually prefer changes movie makes story many cases , many I heard . Jurassic Park one instances I think valid argument made film better , I appreciate quite bit different reasons . I think Malcolm kinda insufferable book version obviously mouthpiece Crichton somewhat luddite fears scientific development . There like 10 page rant pure Crichton spiel guise Malcolm rambling morphine whatever . He got none charisma swagger Goldblum imbues character film . You kinda see anti-science mentality Crichton begun develop emerge novel Malcolm rambling , well Crichton move right wing alarmism climate denialism pretty well known . Film Malcolm instead spares rants condenses punchy lines n't make science foolish endeavor , rather technological recklessness corporate greed . I also think John Hammond infinitely interesting genuinely well intentioned ultimately short-sighted overseer park instead fairly generic greedy corporate bastard novel . Overall , I prefer character dynamics film script long shot . Lex novel literally insufferable child character I think I ever endured . Aging script great choice . Alan Grant gets character arc film whereas n't really one novel . On hand I think novel lot cool terrifying scenes involving dinosaurs , I mean , degree obviously book far time . Still , tone novel definitely horrific overall . I think certainly worth reading . I say book better atmosphere dinosaur action/horror segments , character dynamics film vastly superior . The film also , I feel , induces much better sense wonder awe first half whereas novel much horrific tone . John William music certainly helps regard . ",1
7772,"Jurassic Park book time favorite book . I wish could made huge , complete movie characters 93 movie , events book . Lost World waterfall Trex scene original JP book , well JP3 raptor nest pterodactyl aviary scenes . The intro film Muldoon actually happens directly opening chapter book really neat . Without giving much spoilers , Michael Crichton screenwriter ( ’ think name moment ) film condensed couple characters . Generarro actually bad ass . Hammond love-able . ",1
7773,"If n't yet , read Lost World . It pretty different movie well , Jurassic Park 3 sort circled back grabbed aspects Lost World book setting . I really enjoy Michael Chrichton .

7804,"I also reading book first time massive fan film almost 30 years . Lex literally nothing problem factory way wrote suggests Michael Crichton really n't know much kids writing . It read like someone describes friend annoying kids . There problems book , well . I think half dozen unnecessary detours ( egg hunt everything resolved comes mind ) Ian Malcolm insufferable . There far much rambling chaos theory attempts control nature goes awry . For one , books communicate themes without repeated long diatribes characters exist simply spell . All would necessary Ian explaining chaos theory , expressing concerns , letting plot happen thus demonstrating says . This film handles I think improvement . I think bring regarding ai interesting , many books written general area ( Neuromancer comes mind ) . Despite appreciation chaos theory themes novel , I find Jurassic Park veered much anti science area , especially since many major failings park novel inherent failures design instead characters making absurd errors ( Arnold forgetting switch main power despite literally step one restart process ) . I also take umbridge cynical tone book . It looks nature pure chaos , something almost destructive . The movie replaces wonder nature , beauty power , I think effectively works themes egotistical think could possibly control contain . This turned long ramble thoughts book , sorry .

However I became adult I realized , Hammond absolute shit client Nedry right point messed whole thing . Even movie , portrayed sympathetically , think actual situation actions make far sense much understandable . ",1
7845,"Hammond already owned stakes various lucrative ventures including theme parks Kenya , Costa Rica , tropical locations Jurassic Park .

A country like Costa Rica would likely even help funding something wherever could , felt would drive tourists bolster economy . At end day , Hammond business man , scientist , paleontologist , position making logistical decision something grand .

7872,"That actually I felt Jurassic Park I went see theater already read book ( age 11 ) . My favorite scene left ( Timmy T-Rex ) , Malcolm lives , Hammond lives fucking bullshit . ",0
7873,"The film flows better simplification book . But simplification also means loses lot refinement book . The movie turns Hammond nice old man bad luck instead someone dead set exploiting science profit without regard potential consequences . Along lines , bringing team experts island much impact book movie . In movie spout platitudes running around . In book genuinely acted expertise . Book Malcolm already figured dinosaurs breeding running free tour event started . He reasons way logic mistakes park made blinded realising shit already fucked start matter minutes . Sattler immediately noticing complete lack respect science 're points planted toxic plants around resort pool looks good . Dr. Wu n't mad scientist someone whose completely wrong job . He geneticist forced become zookeeper . He maintaining zoo completely n't understand cares genetics , resulting animals . And happy point Hammond . Jurassic Park n't understand animals nobody cares animals . Muldoon closest someone like advice kill extreme prejudice . To point wants heavy weaponry like grenade launchers hand . And Hammond profit driven mistakes Jurassic Park make much sense . He formed entire project around getting product market fast possible zero care interest obtaining right expertise properly . Even lawyer decent guy Gennaro sees every intention shutting place terrible investment many mistakes made . The movie fantastic simplified everyone involved superficial reflection book version , removing expert views Jurassic Park gave bit depth . As Lex , much younger child book . Hunger fear would dominant driving force child young . The kids serve two purposes book . They give Grant reason traverse significant part park . Grant survivalist , without kids holding back , would crossed island time . The kids provided lot opportunity drama . Grant got invited park palaeontology expertise really story survival expertise , character survive island . The second reason initial disaster , everyone save . Grant kids safe part park . The rest people safe bunker . But Hammond n't want lose expensive animals lysine contingency plan . So uses fact manipulate people shutting fences going park safe . If n't kids , everyone would told Hammond fuck . The dinosaurs would die story would . ",1
7874,"Jurassic Park favorite novel time . I really think ’ perfection movie masterpiece 90 ’ Hollywood , I wish could included missed scenes ( ended Lost World JP3 movies ) . Because I saw movie first I imagine characters screen version I pretty wild visualizations events like Genarro Muldoon riding jeep across open Savannah blow leg Juvenile Trex laser guided rocket launcher ( I remember correctly ) sequence navigating small concrete power shed , plus waterfall aviary . The river scene really sticks mind microceratops trees . Plus iconic scene going underground Raptor ’ den ( explored one Sega games I believe ) bombing island . The big winner Crichton ’ prose genetic engineering biotechnology written 1990 holds true today . Genetic engineering far one , greatest technologies ’ us allow spiral control . Of course ’ seen things like dinosaurs created monsters , biotechnology genetic manipulation really forefront lot issues today . Crichton really ahead time , especially bringing issues like readers 90 ’ . Dare I say- genius . Definitely favorite author . ",1
7875,"I read Jurassic Park I 11 years old close first came saw movie released year later . I revisited book , sequel , weeks ago . My conclusion neither good books . The characters purposely dumb enable make huge mistakes ’ way make Crichton ’ view human ’ carelessness “ genetic power ” work . The idea behind cloning dinosaurs great ’ fragile real cloned dinosaurs would . So create “ failsafes ” , mainly dumb careless humans , assure dinosaurs get upper hand island . Like island real security team handle dinosaurs even doctor people get injured ? On remote island ? Really ? I also still never life understand strategy behind Nedry taking 10 minute break drive way port , huge storm . Taking gas powered Jeep site . And somehow getting back without raising suspicion . That ’ even considering turned fences animals , adding level danger I ’ sure brilliant mind could programmed around . That ’ also one things carried movie without much alteration , also baffling . The movie actually better version , imo . It flows better , ’ believable characters better . Lex especially far better godawful character Lex book . The Lost World movie also huge improvement book , also uses similar series stupid mistakes progress story feed Crichton ’ preachings . Crichton really interesting ideas I think execution ideas hyped far beyond actually stand . ",0
7879,"I like heavily book emphasises . Hammond hubris . The movie kind glosses book , everyone much clearer bad idea makes much stronger expertise . Malcolm figures dinosaurs escaped reproducing minutes arriving park figuring flaws security system logic . Grant , Wu , Genaro , Muldoon others points n't made dinosaurs . They taken many shortcuts made many fixes creatures something entirely new . I loved angle Wu geneticist lost interest Jurassic Park genetic science challenge zookeeper n't care animals . While Muldoon points 're animal park full extremely dangerous animals ca n't bothered really learn makes animals tick . Which wants heavy weaponry n't get . Ellie points sheer disrespect power nature discovers lined swimming pool area extremely toxic plants . The movie , understandably , condense plot lot . Which also Genaro looks weak movie . The book multiple tough guys wiling get hands dirty Grant , Muldoon , Genaro , Ed Regis . The movie combined Ed Genero missing element , sleazy lawyer pushed favour park characters opposed . And Hammond much sleazier book . He manipulates everyone . Even initial disaster everyone save , uses kids manipulate people going park reset power . Hammond massive dick book cares money capitalising investment . Very different movie Hammond dreamer . And yeah , I also felt like book ended got park control . The whole part going raptor nesting area felt like dragging story already found ending . The second book good better first book ! ",1

7975,"* Jurassic Park * book extremely well done read . * The Lost World * better movie version , actually explores interesting consequences Jurassic Park idea , I wo n't spoil , point book pretty interesting completely ignored movie . * Sphere * first adult book I ever read also great psychological thriller . 1990s Crichton full page-turners . It interesting half time ends wrong side history really demonizes particular group ( Japanese Rising Sun , women general Disclosure ) . * Timeline * good read - movie pretty standard action fare , book really exploration interesting question - modern , capable people transported medieval times ? Would survive ? Thrive ? I think * Airframe * underrated one Crichton best ; realistic techno-thriller whodunit . I surprised n't adapted yet . It would make perfect limited series Netflix HBO . 2000s Crichton gets pretty pulpy . As others pointed , * State Fear * another wrong-side-of-history book . When character brings along portable printer print bibliography characters action scenes , pretty much bulldozed fourth wall . Everybody loves * Prey * SO pulpy misogyny vibe * Disclosure * super strong book . I currently 2/3 way * Next * nearly everyone book moustache-twirling villain melodramatic kind . ",1

It interesting elements one book taken applied Jurassic Park sequels media : compy scenes included Lost World film , pterodactyls included Jurassic Park 3 Jurassic World , Dr Wu kind evil/ambitious altering genes dinosaurs certain traits Jurassic World , river raft scene became Jurassic Park ride Universal Studios . It like took four movies theme park ride adapt book , * still * scenes n't translated film ( T-Rex water scene , example ) . The Lost World probably worth read , n't engaging . A lot seems retread first novel story , inferior version . It different film hard really compare two . I think book film weirdly flawed different ways . ",1

It seemed stereotypical action thriller kept going , I felt though could anyone else writing thriller would n't better . It felt generic bland . * * * SPOILERS * * * Ian Malcolm became odd morphine rambling addict end sort message enough I keep interest . The raptors became prion infested creatures shattered idea coordinated attack group set Jurassic Park .

8051,That beautiful Jurassic Park . ,1
8053,"Hitchhiker guide certainly older Jurassic Park , I would think something published 32 years ago significant impact genre ( whether looking science fiction satire ) would qualify . My dad probably n't look John LeCarre The Spy Who Came In From Cold classic since read first published modern writers fans spy genre would probably disagree . I would say Hitchhiker Guide one science fiction novels last 50 years I would say still considered classic 50 years . ",1
8054,"Shocking . Thought I r/unpopularopinion second . Love hate , least admit probably one unique books . I remember loving much , especially prologue . I stopped skipping prologues I finished Jurassic Park . ",1
8057,"Those detailed passages reminiscent 20,000 Leagues though . Just endless detail could interest already interested sea creature morphology ? That first time I skipped big swaths book . Jurassic Park tame comparison , introduced lot concepts I actually interested . Jurassic Park , , good , late high school . Crichton even worse books , though ! ",1
8058,"If liked Michael Chritons Jurassic Park , try Prey , Timeline ( one faves ) , Congo . He also wrote John Lang . If like style story telling far diction , syntax cadence ; Clive Cussler Carl Sagan . Read books movies . This era books written like enclosed 1 shot movies , often turned movies . But book way nuanced . ",1
8059,"I loved book movie pretty equally . * Jurassic Park * one movies I n't mind much deviated book . It good standalone . I really enjoyed Crichton novels . They 're means classic literature best writer , really interesting ideas kept attention really well . My complaints Crichton : * He could n't write decent female character . Every book seems young , blonde , sexy , drop-dead-gorgeous female scientist genius field graduated young . After books realize Ellie clone every Crichton female . * He could n't write dialogue involving young kids ( whenever character young child , get treated toddler baby-talk coming four-year-old ) . * He could n't work research story well . He * lot * research anything wrote , great , every single book ended sudden break story five page virtual monologue scientist character would explain everything reader . This done scientist explain another character , almost non-stop . The character receiving lecture would say occasional , okay ask question ( well would work ? ) scientist would get going another two pages . Now , honestly , would interesting stuff , really lazy way introduce science behind main plot . So , weak points drove crazy I n't consider talented writer , I really enjoy books got excited new one came . I recommend try others ( * The Andromeda * * Sphere * would good choices well * The Lost World * . ) ",1
8060,"I like Jurassic Park . But I ended liking The Lost World even themes . So I definitely reconsider , even though bad continuity resurrecting certain character . I n't know movie influence . But apart annoyance , good read . ",1
8061,"This one absolute favorite books . I read first time I middle school bunch friends started passing around fell love instantly , I ( somehow ) knew movie . I always science-loving kid , Jurassic Park got thinking genetics . Even though science n't entirely accurate books , still made incredibly interested genetics . Now , almost decade , I going school intention career genetics , thanks Jurassic Park . I , , would strongly recommend sequel , especially liked Malcolm . ",1
8066,"Look , I know might unpopular opinion r/books , Jurassic Park way better movie novel . ",0
8070,"Jurassic Park one favorite books one three favorite movies ever . I think book actually written purpose transformed screenplay ( least Crichton initial intentions ? ) As person degree ecology evolution , facts bio-engineering irritated first time I read , I think explanation science behind dinosaur park interesting , thought-out science fiction I ever read . Normally reserve excuses bunky science sci-fi stories take place space , I love Crichton ( extensive medical background ) took lot real science expanded imagination alone tell REALLY exciting story . I velociraptor tattoo everything ( I also love describes enormous reality smaller golden retrievers ) . I really glad see post sub book read people thoughts ! ",1
8071,"This opinion course , I respectfully disagree best novel/adaptation . I loved novel story - pacing detail . It almost feels like documentary . I currently reading - probably fifth time since 1993 . The effects movie blew away 1993 still , John Williams score fantastic , Laura Dern , Jeff Goldblum , many supporting actors spot-on portrayals , rest struck predictible generic comparison book . Ironically , I feel Jurassic Park 3 like Crichton novels . Maybe aviary scenes help . I believe add certain horror element book present Jurassic Park 1 . In regards best novel/adaptation Do Androids Dream Electric Sheep Blade Runner . Again , opinion , I believe many would agree Phillip K. Dick book Ridley Scott movie . ",1
8073,"I actually really love books , first Jurassic Park movie all-time favorite . I like Lost World movie , overall I think ’ kind poor adaptation book . ",1
8074,"I huge fan first Jurassic Park movie ! The next ones okay n't expect live first close book , completely right . The Lost World movie n't great adaptation . ",1
8077,"I n't think Crichton like King . Crichton went med school writing attention detail scientific curiosity drove work . He self-insert , completely different genre , different writing style , nowhere near large bibliography King . I earthly idea would drive anyone compare two . I heard compared technothriller authors like Dan Brown generally pointing superiority plausibly lauding research . The martian similar energy . As writing , I always found sci-fi genre suffers particularly bad writing ( herbert scalzi come mind ) . His type realistic sci-fi also ages poorly . The usual defense ideas rather prose , character , plot . I feel like making excuses . It possible good idea write good book instead lowering bar . Whatever . I agree quite books feel formulic format dreadfully boring . My favorites Sphere , Jurassic Park , A Case Need . I thought Timeline cool idea boring book . Congo aged poorly . ",0
8078,"One creative people ever . Prey one favourite novels . ER , TV show created , one favourite shows . Jurassic Park franchise one favourite movie franchises Westworld ( film ) great first season HBO show great . I recently watched episode ER Eriq La Salle commented death 2008 sad . ",1
8079,"I read bunch books found pretty hit miss . My favourites Jurassic Park , Prey , Airframe , funnily enough , Micro ( finished Richard Preston published posthumously ) . I thought Lost World pretty disappointing , really felt like done movie . ",1
8082,"I read high school ( early 2000s , I watched movie way ) really enjoyed . Looking back , plot holes pretty glaring Crichton prose usual merely functional , hell fun read , good primer get young people interested chaos theory . Jurassic Park one first serious novels I read youngster partially responsible getting serious literature non-fiction , I always give credit . ",1

8117,"I thought book terrible treatment science , I enjoyed anyway I like dinosaurs . I sure people imagine great deal research writing * Jurassic Park * . Perhaps n't remember context book written . The fact chaos theory making rounds popular press days , truckloads fanciful articles * Time * , * Popular Science * , * Popular Mechanics * , etc . It came head publication book [ Chaos : Making New Science ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos : _Making_a_New_Science ) James Gleick , published 1987 , three years * Jurassic Park * . This book made NY Times bestsellers list , nominated Pulitzer , Science Book Prize , bunch others . I would say 90 % Crichton ramblings * Jurassic Park * directly taken Gleick book , including examples mathematician , Ian Malcolm . But unfortunately , Crichton failed understand chaos theory actually says , idea park bound fail humans could n't predict complex interplay variables , ludicrously stupid . That chaos theory says * * . There , fact , lots examples complex systems complex model even powerful computers * * use time * * . For example , airflow wing . That wind tunnels exist , Navier-Stokes equations get really nasty , reliable way solve problem build model see happens . Which since Wright Brothers , billions people flown safely airplanes despite chaos theory . I shocked stupidly deals chaos theory interpretation park breakdown . The unexpected features supposedly chaotic predicted . Like crooked engineer taking money steal embryos therefore shut electric fences ( Dennis Nedry ) . I mean , come , good security point one unsupervised person ca n't fuck entire park hard , military work ? How complex project work , whether building power plant factory ? There whole science dedicated avoiding single points failure . Or unexpected result using frog DNA patch dino DNA makes animals able change sex lay eggs n't supposed . It would make biologist cringe . Is n't enough 're asked suspend disbelief long enough say okay , I wo n't object claim frog DNA replace dino DNA , completely stupid idea ? Now believe something magical frog DNA allows sex changes dinosaurs ? And completely made-up detail somehow supports chaos theory ordains parks bound fail man hubris dares bring dead dinos back life ? The science * Jurassic Park * shitty beyond belief . Unfortunately , Crichton n't realize shitty , hubris kept adding detail would make shittier anyone actually understood subject . Another example . He pastes crapload computer code supposed make book realistic talking Nedry sabotages computers . It might impressed people back 1990 fewer people understood programming , must made real programmers cringe saw GOTO statements . Even novice programmer knows professionals n't use GOTO , fucks code arbitrary jumps one point another . Like [ XKCD comic ] ( https : //www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/7a/goto.png ) show happens use GOTO - fucking velociraptor jumps eats . Crichton books always cringeworthy comes science , completely oblivious . Like writes whole fucking tome masquerading novel ( [ State Fear ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Fear # Criticism_from_scientific_community ) ) deny climate change . While thinking smarter thousands climate scientists whose work misunderstood misrepresented fucking confidently . Crichton prime example [ Dunning Kruger ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning % E2 % 80 % 93Kruger_effect ) , someone ignorant realize extent ignorance . That said , good storyteller , I enjoyed many books stories alone . But I find uncomfortable people praise science , science sucked . ",0

I felt unlikable characters Jurassic Park , snooty asses brilliant knowledge waiting time lord everyone else . I agree Lex bit annoying honestly I liked brother better anyone else book . The Lost World I felt little better . I mean characters completely intolerable I know shit n't I aint going tell , Malcolms case felt like I already told stuff I going tell rest I vindictive little shit .

8172,"To fair , use chaos theory explain problems Hammond park pretty much bullshit . Yes , chaos theory small differences initial conditions large impact final results , : 1 . Not systems subject . Consider dropping marble empty swimming pool . I n't care initial conditions use drop marble , exactly , high drop , even kind throw angle marble going end lowest point pool . This chaotic system . 2 . Crichton used story pretty much time , chaos theory new hawtness popular science , basically sounded cool . But story makes effort justify use chaos theory explanatory mechanism , establish system question ( dinosaurs + park containment systems + big storm ) constitutes system exhibits chaotic behavior . Edit : RE /u/thegingermullet explanation : yes , characters ' small decisions ended big consequences , Crichton attempt use chaos theory explanation happened misguided . The story shows us cases intentional * choices * going awry . Chaos theory systems predict outcome initial conditions system sensitive exact initial conditions neither * measure * accurately enough get good long-term prediction , * reproduce * accurately enough subsequent trials .

I n't think self insert characters bad , I read Ready Player One I see author talking things like one experienced everything . Does make sense ? I think one thing really whole convenient plot devices helped aid Wade along way . For example , playing Joust past helps advance comes getting first key , knowing play guitar perfectly nowhere , playing perfect game Pac-Man , knowing every action line WarGames Monty Python Holy Grail . Stuff like always made roll eyes . Lazy writing finest . ",0

The zero-player-game sequence one important moments cinematic history expressing paranoia , anxiety existential dread Cold War suspenseful , visually impressive yet terrifyingly relatable way .

I think important thing though , right era right sort story , specifically * games * idea certain games important meaningful enough change lives , huge part RPO . The similar film I think * Tron * , Disney . It sad Ready Player One , I suppose n't * strictly * crucial . Just thematically right .

8675,"In opinion , really . To clear , I n't see comment denigrating readers fans book . You like bad book , huge difference liking books bad able recognize offensive parts books . I talking people like Ready Player One specifically , applies lots media . I plenty friend exactly time period book written . They know hot garbage , reading like home town mentioned movie . ( Assuming n't live like New York LA ) It fun little hey ! I know ! However , also subset people n't seem recognize Ready Player One also SUPER offensive shit . The easiest example way treats female characters . There actual passages book go something effect , She < right-click , thesaurus , select fancy word/less mean word unattractive > I n't see way . I thought beautiful . Why n't like ? ! The subtext owes something nice . Never mind narrative character girl smart reasonably successful n't need shit . Worse yet book rewards pathetic bullshit . The main character gets girl . If read thought cool relationships work , I mostly think crappy person . And make matters worse , Ernest Clive ( sp ? ) actually seems think way . If book satire I would almost respect , stuff put online real gross dude . To use different example different author . When I younger I really enjoyed Sword Truth series . I thought cool fun . As adult I able well recognize Terry Goodkind real stupid ideas philosophy , sometimes subtly , sometimes subtly , using books cough ideas . Now asked I read I n't say I liked , I say entertaining . Because aside entertainment , little value . In cases , tell liked book , I gon na assume anything . I probably ask liked . If say fun , cool . If say thought RP1 main character cool guy I probably gon na think less . Granted n't zero , folks say like book find highly offensive , ok make judgement calls . I would suggest asking found liked , know But . I also fine folks n't time people like RP1 , book . ",0

8688,I read earlier script Ready Player One awful . They made main character much older totally ruins story . It supposed poor young boy akin Charlie Bucket . Not jaded 20-something . It also took lot fun references found book . Zak Penn hit miss I think potential . ,1

Cline , pipes around Austin , Texas 1981 Delorean , happy dish kind cheap , knock-off nostalgia Comic Con attendees eat . Theoretically . > Armada poor re-wording passable first novel Ready Player One doubles book flaws . Cline lards first third breezy read pop culture references span Lucas Spielberg Atari Queen . He turning virtually every line exposition exchange dialogue cheap reference constructive , story-based reason . Cline trying demonstrate nerd cred . It sucks . Characters tell repeatedly use Force , spends entire paragraphs describing scenes , descriptive detail , series endless references properties . It lucid dream like [ ] Vanilla Sky . It convincing computer simulation like The Matrix . It elaborate fantasy like old Twilight Zone episode . It goes like , page page page .

You least thirty understand Cline writing , despite occasional F-bomb , prose ready ten year olds . It light reading taken afternoon finish , instead took week slog . Cline cheap ham-handed treatment influences make Kevin Smith nerdery look like high art . At point Cline give Armada room breathe explore Enders Game-meets-The Last Starfighter narrative could really . Despite fact four entire years since debut , book shorter substantially less imaginative . When Armada characters n't circle-jerking Cline cherished memories , 're rushed action scenes . Any dramatic tension Armada builds quickly brushed away lines dialogue everything back turgid , vanilla state . The book barely takes flight half-way crashes tacked-on baffling conclusion author doubt concocted flight deliver manuscript . > I hate book . Cline even acknowledges cool Universal paid pretty penny film rights book , fact made frustrating Armada would make incredibly lazy movie . If Cline capable , less incentive prove ever . ",0

I tried hype much , telling practically everyone drop read RPO , I kidding ? I frothing mouth read Armada . What I n't expecting essentially reskin RPO . The themes , beats , character archetypes . I could almost predict something would happen correlation two books . I n't go expecting RPO Part 2 . But I really felt like I reading RPO v2 . Second , If I dollar every instance begin/began , seem/seems/seemed , suddenly , I would walked away reading Armada nice chunk change . Cline used words much became jarring . I n't like sounding cliched , frequency words used stuck like many sore thumbs . I ended stopping practically every instance see words necessary , I say almost 100 % time , could completely omitted . But book would shortened third , give take , maybe kept padding ? Things moved quickly . The relationship Zack Lex forced . The end wrapped WAY nicely . Sure , little open endedness leave room sequel , rate Zack decided fate humanity , EDA decided wait close Europan attack , made ride Armada bit fast enjoyment . That say I n't like certain parts book . As gamer , I know I gone grand virtual adventures , little part brain late go hey , would n't awesome go epic adventure like game ? I totally relate . When action got going , REALLY got going , I could even overlook unnecessary begans seems . I seen lot people complaining jam packed Armada pop culture referenced . While I agree LOT , I went expecting reading RPO . It made sense book , way used book made sense well . Sure , times I thought reference n't necessary , otherwise , I n't mind nods much . It interesting see Cline next . He 2 2 video game-centric novels . I wondering return RPO sequel , move onto brand-new project . I hope whoever edits next work knows chop words .

8959,"Well I hope right place post . I wanted post thoughts novel , mod bot directed . Sorry entire intro-talking . So I know movie Ready Player One , based novel Ernest Cline , hit theaters . And , hearing hype hearing cover story Sunday Morning , makes , concerned . This going get long , want read , go ahead . If like series , ’ fine , I feel I put word , especially female gaming . I team manager college Overwatch team helped establishing supporting PACG . I logged hours upon hours within video games , learning strategies , pushing rank ( maintaining steady Plat-Diamond-Masters level Overwatch ) , simply fun . I played several MOBAS ( League Legends , Heroes Storm , Dota , Smite ) , MMOS ( Warframe , Warcraft , Eve Online , FF14 ) , various single player games ( Devil May Cry , Bayonetta , etc ) . My avatar Genji . I known Beanji I re-branded portfolio reasons . The majority art artwork Overwatch Warframe . I moderated administrated one biggest Minecraft servers world ( moderate said server youtuber Ssundee entered server 2AM morning ) . I got first ever video game ( Pokemon ) I barely five years old , still play series since . The list go , I think I claim video games big part life . I , , NES played Atari ( I , however , one . I 80′s kid , bit young ) . Even I open gender , speech patterns within gaming community ( I tendency type full sentences 110 WPM + mechanical keyboard yeah ! ) tend others pinpoint gender female ( especially League ) . I ashamed gender , I actually proud girl . But really ’ big deal . It ’ big deal others . But usually . More , handful times , perhaps even 50 times , I harassed pictures body , particularly breasts . I belittled ( ” play like girl ! ” “ suck ’ girl ” like gender anything ) even performance within games matches outmatches rest team . I best video games , visual impairments hurt fpses , reaction speed terrible sometimes . And within time video gaming community , I seen people try literally buy females using in-game currency , items , equivalent , learning gender . ( 50 plat girlfriend , anyone ? ) While hilarious , I also concerned , treats females like commodity bought sold . And I think know ’ problem ’ happening world centuries . It say video gaming community completely sexist , despite mainly male sometimes salty . It say men fault ( sometimes girls meaner ) females victims . I met best friends , boys , girls , lovely rainbow in-between , including girlfriend , love video games . And I still play ridiculous amount video games . However , Ready Player One maintains almost celebrates sort problematic sexist culture within video gaming society , well really addressing problems . I could go , today I want address still subtly sexist overtones Ready Player One almost celebrates . Ready Player One total trash ; address body image issues , although stilted manner . It considered lighthearted read nerdy references , even poorly written sometimes shoved gullet times , nostalgic entertaining times . As someone claimed , ’ like “ literary junk food ” , entertaining “ tasty ” , consumed small doses . If gloss fact little character development barely meaningful plot social issues , fun story . But Huffington Post claim “ fascinating social commentary ” disservice many technology gaming culture . Ready Player One reads like self-insert fanfic Ernest Cline , author . The main character , Wade Watts/Parzival , nothing real world , best game , wins everything end makes right choices , gets girl harassed . When first meets Art3mis , high-level supposedly-female gamer basically story ’ “ trophy ” , flat says “ I ’ crush since even met . From reading blog watching POV . I ’ cyber-stalking years. ” Cyber-stalking . That ’ actual problem people , ’ cute . This probably stated , Wade spends LOT time talking beautiful pretty ( yet different ) Art3mis . Yes , ’ skinny like supermodel , ’ makes cool fact “ looks different ” STILL objectification . Wade tries win favor flooding “ pad ” ton gifts , messaging insistently , just…being creepy annoying . And Art3mis actually goes end , ’ okay objectified , even , beforehand , told Wade basically stop bothering messages . Art3mis becomes silent end . Wade basically buys WORKS . That ’ problem . And one glorified . One actually happens lot . Sometimes MOBAs , people get salty . I , , get bit angry game going poorly sometimes . But insults fly , I usually first go silent , I ’ tired seeing sexist insults screen , accused “ girl ? That ’ suck ” . I know female players well friends , I find girls go silent first . Then ’ Aech , hides gender race scared harassed . Wade confused angry first , suddenly magically overcomes anger supposedly “ lied ” like seconds ’ right thing . And ’ never addressed . In fact , representation transfemale , is…terrifying , seen . Art3mis : How well know Aech ? Parzival : He ’ best friend five years . Now spill . Are woman ? And I mean human female never sex-change operation . Art3mis : That ’ pretty specific . Parzival : Answer question , Claire . Art3mis : I , always , human female . Have met Aech IRL ? Yeah , ’ really specific . Does mean everyone outside definition woman ? Because ’ pretty damn transphobic otherwise . Perhaps ’ Ernest means write claim , passage really leans towards suggestion . And fact Parzival seems almost…threatening Art3mis answer question , ’ also concerning . It also makes wonder . Has Wade never internet ? There lot trolls people real nasty people may hide behind masks , fake identities various reasons . Aech potential lot development , instead becomes sort throwaway character . A lot games problematic terms gender like , I admit . Overwatch issues , WoW ’ outfits sometimes geared toward Male Gaze . GTAV thing sometimes . But concerns . This book , I feel , uses lot “ fluff ” hide fact really serious issues . People claim “ ’ literary fun ” . Yes , GTAV . The gaming culture issues , least certain companies like Riot Blizzard try take steps acknowledge harassment , even ’ slow . There easy solution , ’ try “ cover ” vlrstlu book . But Ernest Cline especially tries claim book friendly sexist , clearly . He uses fluff hide problems claim , transparent flimsy passages try claim “ everything okay ” . There also well known poem , Nerd Porn Auteur . It ’ SFW , I ’ leave , ’ concerning well . I say . If ’ sexist transphobic , hold unpopular opinions , fine . You right thoughts opinions . We right agree disagree . But ’ try delude people ’ . And even something ’ funny fluffy , ’ excuse problems , actions speak louder words , media really big action . If want make statement going perhaps different direction , perhaps book movie way . But I know , I ’ artist girl Internet . And I open ears . ",0

I ’ struggling identify clarify means genre writer today ’ scene : means John Green YA King horror , seemingly continuous cutting literature subgenres separate readers push writers towards specializing certain audiences/editors/literary presses . Do see Armada contributing ? Who even written ? Was juvenile writing supposed make YA ( 80s references ) ? Did write audience readers mind – I expect – wrote studio executives movie producers mind ?

9131,"I also reading Ready Player One buddy said good movie coming . I ca n't get . It fairly predictable I dislike almost everything writers style . The lack character descriptions made feel like twilight book written guys . Where main character however would imagine , interest place . ( note isnt bad thing , I find vivid descriptions characters part fun reading story ) And I really disliked constant use references . If take half references book would like 20 % shorter . Not mention characters felt pretty similar . The world really wasnt well developed , dystopian future set 20 years . If countries fighting limited resources , bet wouldnt entire generation boys sitting virtual world ( drafted get resources ) . Hopefully movie significantly better . Steven Spielberg great director source material isnt unworkably bad . The funny thing I see happening lot people complain characters looking like book counterparts ( without realizing book lax character details ) . I wish would described Wade . I would imagine pretty thin ( lack food ) , tan ( global warming ) , huge muscular arms ( climbing ladders stacks every day ) . Shame used self insert character . ",0
9132,"Ready Player One fairly polarizing book . In experience , everyone reads either loves hates . I love , even though I n't get half references .

Nothing especially deep thought provoking new , enjoyable casually read . ",0

9137,"I really n't think good . I read Armada attempting read Ready Player One . Didnt enjoy Armada people said RPO better ( much ) . The author lacks sense show tell . Anytime references game , show , movie dumpeds unnecessary information reference . For instance lets say main character drops line I father . He follow ; classic film Star Wars : Empire Striked Back released 1982 ( educated guess ) Luke discovers Vader father . You n't say , people n't already familiar refrences would n't reading novel . Another thing I absolutely hate novel rules within OASIS seem constantly change fit thr protagonists needs . Oh , I worried someone jack ride , luckily world allows magic I shrink car put pocker . That unnecessary information muddles world created . The protagonist unlikable , world inconsistent point I hope sixers win instead naive anti-social highschooler . Sorry rant book terrible . ",0

Also , I really hard time empathizing Katniss - terribly likeable , motivations incredibly selfish . Not surprising attitude , considering world ; I found little like , world inhabits .

9603,"I understand liking The Hunger Games - book universally liked people different tastes - I n't understand exactly mean bad writing ? > I n't like purple-prose Collins ' writing SO simplified . There almost description information mostly communicated rapid sentences spoken one another . Is n't entirely subjective ? I , one , n't think books suffered lack description . There many things I thought somewhat lacking The Hunger Games , especially last book , I n't think say sparse description bad writing , much writing style n't enjoy . Ca n't author choose much little description want ? > Tons stuff n't elaborated well , ; example , I first read book I could n't figure happened Gale . I never Gale Katniss shipper , btw , Gale disappearance n't bother way ; seemed like bad writing . I n't get mean . Gale n't much first book n't games . There really n't way include story n't present 95 % . > In fact , whole love triangle really bothered . Is love triangle must EVERY YA novel days ? Love triangles old literature , appeal YA crowd often deal conflicting easily-shifting feelings . That bad writing much trope n't seem enjoy , okay . > Also , Katniss annoying character That extremely subjective . What makes annoying ? Holden Caulfield annoying many people , kind supposed , n't make The Catcher Rye badly written book . Like I said , I problem enjoying books . They n't absolute favorite . I object fact 're trying characterize dislike based fact somehow objectively poorly written . And anyway , storytelling part writing n't ? What read book really great style , grammar , etc . terrible story ? Would say poorly written ? ",0
9604,"I feel like everything post discussed death except one point . Collins IS playwright also screenplays . That Hunger Games seem like script . There three novels broken three acts .

9607,"I agree . While I still really enjoyed reading The Hunger Games , bought trilogy reread , I thought Mockingjay terrible . I could n't finish . I enjoy reading Catching Fire , starting wear thin last chapters . The characters started strong Mockingjay I sick Katniss . Her entire character felt like changed . ",0
9608,"I thought The Hunger Games great series . I went low expectations due YA novel pleasantly surprised . While n't Shakespeare , I find horribly written . I enjoyed decent story quick pace .

9612,"It large vocabulary . I pretty avid writer ( n't make fun guys ! It hobby ! ) I get mean . However , I think Collins ' subject , fantasy futuristic society definitely needs world-building description . I n't know put finger , writing n't help plot . Also , example , The Giver . It book kids , obviously n't high vocab . But amazing . Now , I know The Hunger Games The Giver n't really similar first thing I thought one favorite dystopian novels . Just trying say I definitely vocabulary snob . In fact , I find hard read lot hardcore fantasy novels purposely use much purple prose . On semi-related note , I also really hate new dystopian novels popped Hunger Games ' success . I know always happens every successful YA book ( Twilight , anyone ? ) I tried reading book called Matched absolutely ecstatic recommendation friend oh god , terrible . Basically venting . I really hate taste books different friends . ",0
9614,"Well , lot adult redditors /r/books love . And adults everywhere really . It like Twilight . Twilight universally bashed days .

I actually checked HG wiki elaboration , apparently happened without backstory WHY fancy job district 2 . It really lazy writing . Sorry , I finding hard put thoughts words . If I books I quote passages , I n't . I n't hate simple writing . Often , good . For example , I love way Harry Potter written . SUPER easy read , simple , straightforward . No purple prose written way teen boy thinks . What I n't like Hunger Games way Collins inserts bunch so-called deep , profound sentences novels , reads forced . I n't mind sparse description . In writing ( I author ; hobby ) , I tend describe characters ' looks sparsely I n't think matter , I know people often sympathize first pretty characters . However , subject matter , description n't enough . It completely foreign world , I n't know , seems simple . I wish I could quote passages Eh , yeah , Katniss annoying bad point , I admit . She right . However , I n't think strong badass people think . Personal opinion though . Also , I sure I mentioned , actually , writing n't qualm Hunger Games . I think storyline also n't great . The first book interesting one , second third one really went downhill , opinion . I wish Collins little creative world-building , well . It could much better . I n't think Collins creative smart writer people credit . I really n't recall major twists Oh god , I ca n't believe resulted moments book . Then , I huge fan Chekhovs Gun , I may biased .

All I think Uglies series , The Giver , uh , 1984 I guess , Brave New World , Animal Farm , City Ember , Fahrenheit 451 , The Handmaid Tale , City Ember definitely mostly classics . Now , every new fantasy book dystopian , girl lives safe society ( names like The Union The Territory ) brainwashed meets hot , mysterious guy part Others ( Or , insert cool other-y name ) go journey end overthrowing oppressive government . Maybe authors probably n't much experience oppressive governments ( I saying I , either , except born raised China , I guess , hehe ) none books ever seem least bit realistic .

The Dresden Files follow structure surprise . There 13 books series yet first half really good , takes epic turn middle another near end ( I wondering one leads I eagerly waiting 14th book ) .

Also Golds worship conquers model society ancient Rome - often speaking Latin names like Cassius Octavia . The first book sets world eventually sense The Hunger Games steroids .

This another question would answered read rest books . In summary , main characters found experiment . Chicago , Illinois ( live ) place world divided factions . When escaped wall surrounded city ran people . The world kind destroyed looked abandoned people living outside divided factions . This like Maze Runner type thing .

9803,"I firm believer knowing classics . Classic literature , music , movies , television shows , video games . A foundation classics incredibly important , reason help us understand modern culture . Children certainly exposed classics , also encouraged seek contemporary works well . Because books like Harry Potter The Hunger Games going become classics . Honestly , best way encourage students read appreciate classics let see much influence modern world pop culture . As read Romeo Juliet , explore modern stories star-crossed lovers . As slog ( opinion over-rated ) Scarlet Letter , examine themes shame hypocrisy modern stories . Compare Lord Flies The Hunger Games , explore classic Greek Mythology reading Percy Jackson Harry Potter . Read The Odyssey watch ' O Brother Where Art Thou ? ' Read classic watch episode 'The Simpsons ' references . It crime make Classics boring obligation . It ignorance understand reason classic speak human condition way transcends time . That modern pop culture always alluding classics , outright remaking . And also height ignorance dismiss modern storytelling . Not potentially discourage students reading , ignores one best ways introduce classics children - show favorite modern works directly influenced classics . Any educator ca n't understand n't worth listening . ",1

9822,"Here I thought reading first two : > This series definitely going list teenage kids . It got strong female protagonist , oppressive government , uprising oppressed , real effects poverty , huge disparity classes , inanity conspicuous consumption , barbarity modern entertainment , importance art . thoughts reading third : > Let say right bat hardest read series . And intentionally . With final installment The Hunger Games , book millions fans bound read one way , Collins able finally take story darkest significant places , without worrying keeping around casual fans next book . The Hunger Games hook , Catching Fire set deep , Mockingjay Collins reeled us boat , many readers may realizing bit . > Characters want . Collins leads us plot points expect see exciting violent action take place , action happen screen , simply abandons idea altogether make point . It effective method reader running hallway chasing friend , turn corner smack wall . Important people die . Good evil blurred reader begins question whether anyone story rightly considered hero . Katniss deeply flawed . So Gale . So Peeta . So Haymith . Not flawed everyone problems imperfect nearly irredeemable . Almost like 're real people , really deeply involved terrible violent game war . > I less surprised author conclusion mind , surprised editors let carry . Only popularity first two books would anyone read talk novel , would widely read stand alone , without third installment , first two danger complicit human crime Collins concerned glorification violence misunderstanding consequences . > I think going lot people like conclusion , least rank least favorite series , opinion elevated story entertaining teen fare significant important work .

9823,"Here things The Hunger Games I found lacking ( * * spoilers * * ) : 1 . Kat face moral dilemma situation presented . There clear divide good guys bad guys , point bad caricatures . When Kat kill , hand always forced matter self defense , made clear reader bad guys . This easy way . At end , 2 left finally forced confront situation , author pulls absurd , cheating ending . 2 . The question trust arena glossed . Peeta mindlessly loyal puppy dog , Rue innocent little girl- motives never ever issue . The paranoia games create interesting , yet even . The author much better job including aspect 2nd book , honest reason I finished 2nd book . 3 . Most arena contestants absolutely personality backstory , died zero emotional connection . In Battle Royale , reader learned virtually every character , made much interesting . Why I care faceless badguy # 12 died ? As side point , alot tension n't since theres never doubt Kat survives since part trilogy though I n't think theres anything author could done fix . Even 3rd book , I highly doubted Kat would die written first person , would literarily awkward . 4 . Was sappy love triangle really necessary ? I get YA book love triangles popular , I could n't bring care love problems . All issues addressed Battle Royale . BR far perfect ( HG much better job creating dystopian society ) , better job whole games aspect . I say HG fantastic job ending chapter cliffhanger . In end , I found biggest overall problem series Young Adult book , situation better explored non-YA book . ",0
9825,"I read Hunger Games series Battle Royale , loved . One may argue rip Battle Royale , actually something . It taking idea going deeper , pushing making author story , rip-off . It idea ( kids battling death , essence , amusement controlling government ) take extremely different directions ( although whole battle idea may similar ) . And also , writer nowadays n't stand shoulders giants , speak ? Not zombie books rip-off zombie books , mostly similar aspects ( strange outbreak , world shuts , survivors trying survivor , horrific acts humans pushed end ) . Most fantasy novels seemingly parallel worlds , least themes within worlds . It n't make rip , makes expansion idea captures hearts souls readers around globe . It reinterpretation revival ideas stories , old new , makes books . EDIT : Also , n't worry investing lot time Hunger Games ; 're generally quick reads . My friend read first one days ago took 3 hours . That lot people ( like 3-6 hours per book ) . That say race meet time constraint , means read pace , I trying give positive reinforcement favor reading ; even 're slow reader probably wo n't take extreme amount time , seems one concerns . They 're one types books Once start ca n't put , definitely worth read ( two ) . ",1
9827,"I personally liked Battle Royale . It touches lot elements The Hunger Games eventually tried hand , I think focus little different . With BR , kinda get bigger picture , narrative sweeping around catching little vignettes students island faring . Makes little effective mind get know people outside main characters pretty well . It good since I read , I think Takami also really great job making sure never forgot ultimately 're dealing kids . Some try work together , profess love high school crush , others take whole kill classmates thing pretty well . I think really sold made little terrifying went . And sense , I think actually common thematically Lord Flies The Hunger Games . ( I n't read last two books series , though , heads ! ) If n't checked yet , definitely pick newest Haikasoru edition . BR received couple line-by-line translation updates since I first read , apparently newest edition essential English version . ",1
9828,"Battle Royale individualistic , I think . It deals less society moral issue classmates killing . It talks stories , lives . The Hunger Games revolution - like Battle Royale larger scale , makes sense . Honestly , great . Both extremely interesting say , good writing . They 're definitely going remembered road ! ",1
9830,I know mean soppy love triangle . I really feel hurt story . And I never issue romance story . Actually pretty essential part stories . However really made sickly Hunger Games . ,1
9832,"Because finished Hunger Games , I going perfervidly recommend following two books easily best dystopia world : 1984 George Orwell A Brave New World Aldous Huxley . Granted 're part series , 're essential reads . ",1

9839,You read . The Hunger Games good action filled book . I felt 2 like 1 3 OK . But worth reading . Nice easy reads . But Chaos Walking excellent well thought novels . Each character novel brings something new trilogy . I checking Maze Runner Trilogy . ( btw long time since I YA ! ! ) ,1
9842,"I feel book lacking pretty much matters . Collins treats death piece bread . None characters seem care murdered someone . These people n't adults 're kids . They killed kids , like Oh shucks Johnny , I killed another kid age , whoops ! . On top book n't even get actual games untill 2/3rds way book . Even main character hides cave , , writer , forces dull romance . Then After actual game character whines romance , even though hunger games , killed kids similar situations . Now 're sequel copy first book , Amazing cliff-hanger end takes entire chapter explain , looses significance meaning . * * TL ; DR : * * Collins n't understand significance war , murder . The books cop cash , movies even kids lack imagination . Sorry side tracking conversation . ",0
9843,They release Battle Royale English call The Hunger Games . The teens wo n't notice difference old peoples enjoy watching BR . Except NC-17 .

9849,I loved Hunger Games trilogy . It gripping I loved characters real full emotions . It really great see dealing . I agree mockingjay certainly n't strongest book incredibly enjoyable . I think second book favorite second book always favorite trilogies whatever reason . ,1
9851,"I sincerely appreciate input . I definitely look . I honestly love quick series like Hunger Games . I read Divergent Series even quciker , I definitely n't like much . I also recently read Martian , n't technically young adult novel , definitely catered nerdy self ",1

9853,"Same .. I felt like one endings movie huge building explodes characters walk away ends staring beach somewhere . I wanted .. I wanted see effects went society whole , secluded district twelve view gave us end . Was message suppose life never changing cycles ? No matter whose power always type force revenge involved .

9860,"The first book introduction hunger games . The second revolution . The third outright war . I absolutely loved third book . What terrible story wat , PTSD , destruction , death , etc . I shed tears sure . I probably liked third writing . After I loved 2nd revolution .... I love stories people rising injustice . The first one one I enjoyed least . It YA love triangle 2 books . It ok . The two get better ! Since I enjoyed , I recommend . Truly excited.for third movie ! ",1
9863,"I say give read . The movie books stand quite well enough differences make interesting . Off top head I know movie added two scenes : riot Kato speech made little human . The book lot gruesome near end , certain creatures lot scarier things I think would surprise . Catching Fire ( book movie ) quite good , I mixed feelings Mockingjay . Waiting see handle movie . While The Hunger Games personal favorite book movie , many folks I know liked Catching Fire lot . ",1
9864,"Yes , yes , yes . I teaching 4 years ( middle school , suburban Atlanta ) , absolutely VITAL engage interest reader . The Hunger Games feeds precisely mainstream young readers . It reads like movie , except much richer movie , quintessential advantage books movies . ( Same thing Harry Potter , , sadly , Percy Jackson series . ) There plenty room world excellent taste intellectual snobbery , definition , masses going go middle ground . ",1
9865,"First , I read Harry Potter way think flawless work , though I enjoyed . Twilight I despise several reasons , series I think things VERY well . The author keeps events systems , particularly way society run games structured , excellently described planned . That I gripped books . However , characters fallen series YA cliches depressing . Now , certain points , I agree . We become increasingly desensitized violence tragedy I think literature becomes popular- morbid level , humanity fascinated bloodshed . The people books revel watching Hunger Games reflect part . Look Roman Coliseum . Even entertainment men beat daylights , people drive cars recklessly sometimes explode , news media always filled murder , rape , war destruction . But things NEVER accepted . Killing children , rape , pedophilia , necrophilia , etc . Well , excellent discussion , problem book content , writing choices author makes , even though I believe far talent Stephenie Meyer . ",1
9866,"As much I dislike Orson Scott Card person , I say point . Maybe n't fair pick young adult book something like , setting hunger games definitely biggest flaw story . The entire USA reduced 12 colonies apparently 1,000 people , one city . Each colony specializes producing one product industry . And goes . You get feeling stripped empty landscape ( like wasteland , like author could n't bothered ) . It comes across contrived childish , though created someone idea world really works . Of course , exactly point , author n't bother , setting n't focus story . But anything felt tacked together flimsy . And detracted series whole . ",0
9867,"I think might misunderstanding meant believable . I n't think much realistic world plausible , rather detail depth setting . The setting Hunger Games slapped together duct tape glue . Its paper thin shows . The entire world feels like 1,000 people left . Each district conducts one industry . There real mention rest world . It comes across like something child might brainstorm someone idea real world works . No complexity . Of course , real reason probably author n't want bother matters . The setting really excuse bad people putting kids ring fight death . The focus elsewhere . Of course , n't mean weak setting n't hurt story . It easily biggest issue well , constantly pulling book . I dislike OSC ( despite liking books ) probably spiteful unfair ( least devoid tact ) comment , I agree setting terrible . ",0
9871,"Well I think The Hunger Games one worst books I ever read . It cliched , poorly written , assumed reader idiot times , incredibly unlikeable main character . But I seem outlier . Everyone else REALLY likes , I leave one last ",0
9873,"Sorry disagree everything previous commenter wrote , I think * The Hunger Games * probably one best books I ever read . I think value adolescents well adults . I thought writing style perfect story Collins trying write . I admit though last book gets really dark characters slip little bit , much value plot alone . It worth reading , even make mind subject .

9874,"Yeah I n't approach The Hunger Games many expectations . The book written young-adults exactly intended literary masterpiece . I found pretty simplistic predictable , I certainly read worse . ",0
9875,"I sort agree . The Hunger Games good enough I still want read rest book ( I halfway ) , I already know I n't like . Instead The Hunger Games , I suggest OP check Battle Royale , similar story written much better fashion . Though I never read , OP could probably also check The Running Man The Most Dangerous Game well . ",0
9876,"There major difference sequels The Hunger Games , sequels Ender Game . Namely - Speaker Dead * completely * different story , tone , message - hell even time period . Ender Game originally supposed short story introduction Andrew wound interesting items personality defects , good Orson Scott Card publisher told turn novel . ",1
9878,"My mother voracious reader . Seriously , reads everything . She 80 . She really enjoyed The Hunger Games . She one told . So I disagree others old like . I think included note much liked made think differently things could lead great conversations granny . A book means something mean something . ",1
9879,"dont give set books n't derivative written specifically YA market ? speaking adult read hunger games books came , n't think single new idea tbh n't well written either , especially second two 're teen 're first exposure certain ideas obviously interesting grandma age n't think going case say get something else ",0
9882,"Ok , let break . There magical combination well written accesible make unbelievably popular . Too easy read anyone pride literacy eschew complex fare , high-brow alienated majority available market . The Hunger Games easy read , still interesting complex enough appeal largest audience , result hearing every Tom , Dick , Mary . Considering number adults I know enjoyed I say picked probably find written higher level read middle school , I bet even enjoy . But I would n't expect life changing epiphany , subtle literature trying . ",1

Either way , happy reading good luck learning English , post good btw . ",1
10705,"If 're looking get Gaiman , I would recommend Stardust . Both book & movie great , slightly different . Pratchett Discworld books set Ankh-Morpork tend use lot references London-y things . But I would recommend Small Gods like religious satire . It like parallel Christianity went crusades knocking doors spreading word . Great stuff . Edit : The beginning Good Omens may feel little disjointed coz written kinda like intro scenes movie massive cast . It comes together bit , builds pretty great book . ",1
10706,I way I love Good Omens . May worth look . ,1
10707,"I slightly relate , Pratchett always awesome writer I read Good Omens I could n't find anything else paled beside fantasy novels set Discworld ",1
10709,You probably get references Good Omens got kinda understanding bible . Just basic armageddon stuff . It stand-alone pick without reading anything else . I often recommend gateway book authors . ,1
10713,"Both Good Omens & Hitchhikers Guide * * rooted specifically British culture 1980s-90s , culture three authors ( Pratchett , Gaiman & Adams ) intimately familiar . The passage GO picked poking fun places offer activities corporate retreats , paintball , try make seem interesting pointing history building activity happens - even though irrelevant activity . ",1
10715,"As huge fan Terry Pratchett , style writing typical books heavy satire . In particular , likes insert whole paragraphs worth asides make point general society related main plot talked . So ready lot non sequiturs convoluted sentence structure , definitely tough non-native speakers . I say humor Good Omens particularly tough even though I love book , much satire requires know specific things 80s British culture I neither British enough old enough know references . If want try similar satirical writing might less based culture n't know , Discworld books might good place start . Especially read good amount sci-fi fantasy , much satire around tropes genres . ",1
10716,"I really struggle reading style writing audio books saviour . For good omens particularly really good reading David Tennant , Michael Sheen , Rebbecca Font . It almost radio play actually reading book voices . ",1
10718,"As people mentioned , Good Omens Hitchhikers Guide deeply rooted Satire , one sophisticated uses language . Not must fluent , must also deep knowledge base things culturally important , equally , taken granted culture writers . If want sci-fi might approachable , I recommend Expanse books , TV series help clarify might confusing . Also Ursula K Le Guin ’ Left Hand Darkness Dispossessed utilize clear language describe happening . If want good interesting time travel book , Doomsday Book Connie Willis good read . A lot “ Britishism ” approachable Pratchett folks less exposure Brit Cultural Norms . Frank Herbert ’ Dune fantastic slow burn glossary back . A wonderful critique Feudalism exiting sci-fi setting . I ’ recommend Neil Gaiman newer English readers ’ interested plot writer , ’ stated multiple times ’ mood setting . This leave folks without implied context hand feeling like work overly thin nonsensical . However , really want enjoy mood , Neil Gaiman ’ looking . ",1
10723,I recommend watching Good Omens season 1 listening book audio . You ’ probably pick humor understand plot ( show ) listen someone else reading . ,1
10726,"The sentence posted example , convoluted . It make sense . You familiar culture making fun . But posters explained better . Go get book written Dick Francis . He wrote good detective stories , highly successful page-turners . And \ * very\ * easy read people learning English starting read English improve language . I position . I started simplified editions - books English re-written use simple vocabulary grammar . There many levels difficulty . After I finished simplified editions English learners library , I took home bunch books return unread . In desperation I saw Dick Francis book borrowed . I read books translation I knew writes page-turners . I breezed book , I sorted horse-racing vocabulary . But small hurdle . There n't many special words deal horse racing , jockeys , horses , breeders , stable-hands Nowadays I read enjoy Good Omens , Call wild , Silence lambs . ",1

Chop extraneous clauses pull core sentence : - The kind companies hired places like liked feel strategically interacting building Elizabethan financier endowed plague hospital . Honestly , exhausting . I n't really enjoy Good Omens I read , perhaps dense writing like kept pulling story . In end , I n't give shit characters , I vague idea actually happened plot .

In fact , Imma read 1 star reviews goodreads laugh . ",0
10759,"The author quote exactly uses information starved , rather overly-elaborate style writing , example virtually written filler important part first words even probably n't matter much advancing plot . It kinda like someone randomly stripping naked dancing Macarena nowhere nothing story random strings meaningless words added pad content little try sell books , unique British writing use lot . I like style writing , enjoyable normally . Douglas Adams ( Hitchhiker guide ) another one goes soliloquies gets sidetracked time work I greatly enjoy . If I may suggest , beginner reader English first language , reading weighty tomes Jane Austen ? I read maybe 25k books time , mostly fantasy fictional stuff , I read cuz TV fluff fun unless I actively studying something useful/practical like programming bricklaying . But I never bothered ( never ) read pages stuff like Jane Austen like reading War Peace , real North Americans except academia VERY rare , arrogant , usually rich , jerks . So , beginner reader without English first language skills , reading pointless , pretentious garbage Jane Austen ? I persistent question intent want get experience matters , 're looking understand Western Culture better desire fit way better watching The Simpsons , VERY STRONGLY URGE YOU watch Hitchhiker Guide MOVIE , ideally subtitles native language turned , Good Omens book Hitchhiker guide maybe lot North American culture might make lot sense afterwards .

For people want get English lit , I strongly agree good YA novels great starting point , 're aimed less context-aware humans wo n't get meta jokes corporate retreats yet .

10816,"I love Good Omens , I agree , good introduction either author . Much like two musicians love get together duet , often n't seeing best either - often great fun cool novelty would recommend Dancing The Street Space Oddity Brown Sugar . As someone grew reading Just William books moved onto Pratchett Gaiman , Good Omens delight . But , I get someone looking outside would see flaws ",1
10817,I never read Pratchett Gaiman picking Good Omens I loved book . If jokes commentary first chapters n't hook I dont know say . Lots good jokes England/London ( im even ) . The nuns messed baby transfer . A car transforms everything Queen . The relationship angel demon . ,1

10833,"Good Omens n't really great portrayal Gaiman style , moreso anything reminded Discworld Series Pratchett , co-authored . If n't like Good Omens I would take mean n't like Terry Pratchett style Neil Gaiman . If ever wanted test , The Ocean End Lane 180 pages much better introduction Gaiman style . It book adolescents I read 22 still feel like I got money worth . ",1

The Graveyard book I always thought children ’ story I ignored til recently , I bought copy I intend read soon . As Good Omens I started half dozen times never made close 200 pages deep . Not cause ’ bad , never grabbed . I ’ think representative Gaiman ’ work ( say love ’ totally also right ) . If gon na give another Gaiman book shot I totally recommend Neverwhere . It ’ probably quickest I ’ ever read book , ’ phenomenal . ",1

10844,"I ’ fan Terry Pratchett Neil Gaiman Good Omens simply flawed . It ’ much better TV show book . The structure really poor robs book pace least first third , maybe . The jokes good ’ worn thin long end characters ’ particularly deep compelling . If enjoyed The Graveyard Book , try Neil Gaiman ; ’ let Good Omens put . Coraline Stardust similar , The Ocean End Lane little stranger , American Gods much bigger darker . All well worth look .

And may help get Good Omens world better visually seeing . ",1
10848,"As much I enjoy Gaiman , bit charlatan . 'The Graveyard Book ' 'The Jungle Book ' ( admits ) .

10855,"I love Terry Pratchett immensely like Neil Gaiman sometimes ( Ocean End Lane fantastic , I barely made American Gods ) . I truly feel like Good Omens sort worst . It n't dark sort fairy-tale brooding Gaiman stuff I like Pratchett influence sort feels like muted version usual writing makes sense . Like definitely see influences authors , reading felt like something ended somehow less sum parts . I fully understand heresy lot people , I also met lot people read Good Omens loved , never read much either authors ' works , maybe , American Gods .

10905,"I think lot people forget , ’ aware , Good Omens Neil Gaiman ’ first published work fiction . Everything ’ done prior non-fiction . As fiction writer ’ found style yet I think shows book whole feeling much Pratchett ’ voice . Secondly , story structure parallel narrative , many equally weighted storylines , protagonists . In Good Omens protagonists move inexorably towards final climax come together single place time . Parallel narratives often feel messy bit challenging follow . I ’ found help focus characters moved final meeting , journey often revealing importance , rather trying suss soon appear . ",1

I think Pratchett plot writing lot easier see * retrospect * moment . He loves write endings call back small interactions thought window dressing , fit perfectly themes main conflict . Granny Weatherwax epitome - really hard understand clever practical solutions * * magic point view , get climax story , see small errands lead perfect logical solution problem . Going Postal another great example kind plot-by-worldbuilding , one favorite endings fantasy , besides Bartimaeus trilogy LotR . ",1

10935,"If wan na read Gaiman books , American Gods great ( series 're feeling lazy , although ) . Neverwhere The Ocean End Lane also great . As Good Omens , I personally think great - parts made giggle ( mid end , gets super fast ) . The river scene post office driver mulling past times one favorites . It depends like , though . I Latino though , I super used convoluted magical realism timelines ton characters - think 100 Years Solitude Gabriel Garcia Marquez . ",1
10936,"I felt I read Good Omens , I gave 2/3 way . I ’ think I like Gaiman OR Pratchett . I might get raked coals saying , I ’ tried books Gaiman ’ get either . Never tried another Pratchett , Good Omens style Gaiman ’ , ’ definitely . ",0

I see authors trying funny like reading words words , actual story . I like characters Aziraphale , Crowley , Pepper , Adam etc . But weird pointless . The whole book like wild goose chase , literally . All characters looking Adam . Most characters standing stage crowding absolutely contribution . The whole 'witchfinder ' thing . The annoying character sergeant , Madame Truffey . What even ? Pulsifier even Anathema Device . They role sake . Oh even four 'horsemen ' talk completely unnecessary bar scene four 'horsemen' Only Crowley , Aziraphale seemed actual role contribution plot story . ",0
10942,"I old ( mid 1990 ) interview Neil Gaiman points Good Omens written Neil Gaiman Terry Pratchett trying make laugh . Most aspects mention follow : off-the-wall humor , footnotes , copying others ' styles , 'hey , look , another cool thing ' tempo book . And 300-odd pages faffing , sent whole thing publisher , somehow got greenlit became cult hit , . Gaiman mentions interview interest sequel weight expectations . I believe quipped typical Gaiman-esque fashion 'men serious briefcases thin watches several meetings Terry I allowed room ' . So Good Omens : two talented , off-beat writers jamming typewriter . It resonated n't anything like time , helped launch two lauded careers ( helped book stay spotlights ) , eminently quotable . But * * : hidden code , perspective-switching realisation , volumes literary analysis . There nothing * get * : clever funny fantasy book , , perfectly okay . ",1
10944,"Neverwhere really fast read , yea , Gaiman different books , largely Pratchett . I read Good Omens first tackling Gaiman ’ actual works kind glad I . I love Pratchett know work different , depending mood I choose read . ",1
10947,"God , yeah , hard . I enjoyed Good Omens loved Pratchett Discworld , I ca n't life get Gaiman . ",1
10951,I read something Pratchett writing . It still might cup tea I n't think Good Omens enough conclude . ,1
10952,Weird . Good Omens introduction Gaiman I immediately loved . Then I tried read American Gods boring hell . I assumed Gaiman n't great without Pratchett . ,1
10953,"My feelings Pratchett fan never cared much Gaiman ( Stardust pretty good , anything else , including Good Omens , decidedly meh point-of-view ) Good Omens good example Pratchett book . So like 're saying Good Omens n't good reason dislike Gaiman writing style I say also good reason dislike Pratchett writing style . Overall , I found book underwhelming . It failed get close showing best either author abilities . ",0
10954,Anansi Boys least favorite . American Gods favorite far . But Good Omens fun book . ,1
10955,"I disagree , adult novel I read Gaiman incredibly scattered . To , seems like Good Omens takes humor Pratchett , organization Gaiman . Terry Pratchett shift perspectives occasionally , , makes sense , understand happening . Neil Gaiman , I love man , novels hard get . American Gods pushed majority book . ",0
10956,"Absolutely true ! I love Gaiman , Pratchett ’ sense humor ’ mesh mine . As result , I ’ care Good Omens book nearly much Gaiman ’ novels . On hand , Gaiman showrunner Good Omens series , lot Gaiman flavor result . Plus , acting superb . ",1
10958,"Completely agree . OP , u/Sports_are_pain , style Good Omens definitely along lines Hitchhikers Guide Discworld . It written quite early Gaiman career relatively early Pratchett . You tell writing , part , make laugh . It representative Gaiman writing , hard put Neil Gaiman exact box ( write * Do n't Panic * HHGTTG , , much style ) . I loved * The Graveyard Book * * The Ocean End Lane * . I also particularly enjoyed short stories , The Man Who Forgot Ray Bradbury October , I consider mild Gaiman . ",1
10959,"I ’ read Good Omens , I recall leaving sour taste mouth , Addams Vonnegut always leave delighted . I think GO “ winky ” . Its jokes equivalent person looking eye , unblinking , telling joke , waiting laugh . ",0
10960,"Agreed . Gaiman comes flavours : scattershot , wandering type ( American Gods , Neverwhere ) ; heady delicious children/YA stuff ( personal favourite category : Coraline , Graveyard Book , especially Ocean ) ; farcical work ( Stardust , Good Omens ) ; graphic novels ( Sandman particular , overlapping first category ) . There enough I love know I n't love everything . ",1
10961,"Ive read Sandman , Good Omens American Gods . All great ideas , poorly developed . The exception parts Good Omens tell Pratchett primarily contributed . It could said I n't read enough Gaiman truly appreciate I read far n't make want read anymore . ",0
10965,I always suggest Lamb Christopher Moore people enjoy Good Omens Terry Pratchett . Lamb hilarious take Jesus ' life ,1
10967,"Gaiman said people looked Good Omens tried work wrote got wrong , author copied others style try create holistic work , apparently ending swapping rather fully blending . ",1
10969,"Ah makes sense . I love read works , really connect Pratchett ’ humor . Must I adore Good Omens . ",1
10970,I big fan Pratchett Gaiman I still somehow enjoy Good Omens . ,0

10972,"Neil talks beginning Good Omens came bit podcast David Tennant . It kind interesting , I could wrong , sounds like Pratchett actually reached instead way around , really n't sound like gave ton time project . Good Omens one favorite books Pratchett Gaiman two favorite writers , Good Omens feel like Pratchett novel based Gaiman premise Gaiman writing splashed . Which makes sense , Pratchett much established writer time written Gaiman less published works . However , Good Omens show worked Pratchett filled good humor I n't specifically remember book . I think Gaiman funny , telling jokes kind way . ",1
10973,I think Gaiman kind tempers Pratchett style bit makes sense . I liked Good Omens Pratchett books I tried gets less far nonsensical end spectrum . ,1
10975,"Oh yes , saw Good Omens AmazonPrime really great . Rewatched well . Meant I would like see Monty Python version The Omen , lol ",1

Humour weird thing personal . In family I Monty Python fan . We enjoyed Mr. Bean though sister I loved Young Ones , humour ( mind ) often close Python . Anyway , ramble ; ) ",1
10977,"Good Omens first book I read either author . The next book I read , recommendation , American Gods * * different book . It point I realized difference styles two authors . They ’ alike would automatically appealing audience , imo difference genre tone might make one appealing one person . Although someone relatively broad taste I certainly see overlap . ",1
10979,"I heard several interviews gaiman said worked really hard preserve Terry vision voice , felt like Pratchett watching shoulder . To , sounds like far careful Good Omens project solo projects , bc wanted right friend/the work felt little like friend . Everything I read gaiman say Pratchett makes sound like deeply respected still acutely misses hes even saved Pratchett books back read wanted spend time Terry mind . ",1
10983,", love Pratchett lot Good Omens back forth Gaiman , mostly discovered writing got comics kid read whole Sandman series got books . So Gaiman little bit “ heres edgy teen 80 ’ goth ” take thing never really fully got characters ( besides Death , good solo comic story ) . Whereas Pratchett feel well good characters , ’ different relatable ways , humor observation feel natural organic writing style . That said , ’ adaptation The Sandman audible came recently im enjoying even though first part series comics least little weak compared rest series ",1
10985,Good Omens like The Book Revelation written style The Hitchhiker Guide Galaxy . ,1
10988,"The humor Terry Pratchett . If 're going read Discworld , could start Guards , Guards ! ( leads favorite storyline ) could try one standalones like Pyramids Small Gods . Good Omens absolute favorite book , I like Gaiman Pratchett individually . If 're humor though , go Pratchett next . ",1

10999,"If like multiple narratives converging , interesting , humorous way things described , Death , Pratchett part GO . The heart Adam acts way , little boy idyllics , warm relationships , ineffable themes running Gaiman part . Discworld keeps Pratchett themes , Gaiman carries themes writing . For Gaiman , like Adam story line Witch fella , read The Ocean End Lane . If like 4 horsemen , read Mort ( Pratchett ) American Gods ( Gaiman ) . Also , want sci-fi like good omens , read hitchhikers guide galaxy . ",1
11002,"I started Guards ! Guards ! really enjoyed , whole set books follow characters . I also rather like Small Gods thought stood well . Good Omens I would say takes dominant writing style ( i.e . witty narrative style ) Terry Pratchett , lot Discworld series , recommend enough . ",1

Maybe I hold reading . ",0
11028,"The tone books different . I see lot Pratchett Good Omens personally ( necessarily bad thing , maybe I young American really get Pratchett , even though I enjoy reading The Discworld books I made ) . Funny enough , American Gods standout favorite book ( ha ! After book vs tv debate ) , I say , seminal story opinion ( Sandman awesome , everyone comic format ) I generally binge reader one kept busy whole weekend straight . Best n't seen show yet , read many discussions online ! Number 2 rec would oldie goodie Smoke Mirrors short story collection super haunting would live back head days . I think nice overview type ideas themes lot stories . ",1

Most Discworld miniseries worth watching well . I read The Sandman entirety around 2005 absolutely blown away . It really got back comics . Covering rest Gaiman work actually led Pratchett way Good Omens . Probably favorite works , besides The Sandman , Anansi Boys . I really liked American Gods , Anansi favorite character follow title really resonated , actually hit close home . I could n't watch American Gods . It made sad .

HIs empathetic understanding human nature ability recreate manner fantasy species holding mirror Earth incredibly engaging . Night watch possibly favourite book time . The Bromeliad trilogy ( Druckers/Diggers/Wings ) superb standalone series Wings still gets tear eye inability put last 50 pages . ,1

No clue work , hey , life would n't fun without little risk . ",1
11262,"It hard Doctor Who fans realize everyone . My advice would start Christopher Eccleston season ( even though I fan Doctor ) really makes transition Tennant much sweeter see enormous growth Rose . The first bit Matt Smith run good , gets cute pretty quick I admit I lost interest . Peter Capaldi brought back gruff surly portrayal I also admit I need catch watch episodes I really get derailed second Matt Smith season . I watched bit Jodie Whittaker show I really like . It big change show needed I like get back track . That said , I think Tennant seasons really special place hearts modern Doctor Who fan . It rage ( well , outside England least ) moments first season Tennant best television history . It shame Russell T. Davies leave . Tennant magic intoxicating . You ca n't help feel like jump building got excited made seem compelling . I worst person ask advice far Good Omens goes I really seen bit result fiasco . I enjoy Neil Gaiman I seen show pretty good , perhaps everything mass appeal going scratch itch everyone . My advice would go original source sometimes inspire drive get know something better .

11276,"I heard great things Neil Gaiman . I finally bought first book ( perhaps two ? ) I saw Barnes & Noble leather-bound collection : American Gods Anansi Boys . I huge fan Supernatural ( anything involving dichotomy Good vs . Evil ) course I read . Great concept ! Extremely boring . Even knowing 90 % gods I first read , point sad bloke named Shadow playing chauffeur . Anansi Boys also neat idea , poorly handled . I figured I got taste Gaiman , perhaps * best * work .. let try Good Omens ! Nope , also boring . I thought humor either random ( point funny ) extremely predictable . I n't think could deeper meaning , least intended . I know lot people love work , power , basic writing regarding rather un-mainstream topic . I hope I n't offend Gaiman fans . ",0
11278,"So , true . Gaiman plenty humor work , much drier darker see Good Omens . A lot humor GO strikes almost Douglas-Adams-like ( see : cassettes turning Best Queen ) . ",1

11284,"Good Omens always feels like much Terry Pratchett book , Neil Gaiman book , opinion . The humour like Pratchett , subject matter , well inversion Antichrist story . This book little Gaiman darker edged cynicism , mostly Pratchett . I always really loved Adam power Antichrist , brought normal boy , healthy group family friends , instead chooses live quiet , idyllic life see Tom Sawyer , work Enid Blyton Just William stories . He fashions world wants . Aziraphale Crowley great double act , I agree idea angel demon friends , 're two working stiffs , banding together foil Crowley boss , really great take angel/demon archetypes .

The 1993 adaptation book perfect . Every change made adds something important cut away scenes bit repetitive , irrelevant work book . Plus , cast , soundtrack cinematography amazing . In opinion really masterclass adaptation . The movie n't keep spirit/meaning book , even enhances expands . And 2020 version mediocre children movie dog ( n't exist book , somehow important thing movie ) , called The Secret Garden despite even emphasis kind secret garden . & # x200B ; An honorable mention Whale Rider .

11392,"Sure ! Here ’ bit first paragraph/thesis : “ While concept flaneur born France 19th century , flaneur continually reproduced used literary figure . Such reproduction may include Holden Caulfield , main character J.D . Salinger ’ novel * The Catcher Rye * , Holden similarly traverses urban city space active observer . However , despite Holden embodying key traits flaneur , observation engagement surroundings—people place—are born inherent longing live observe within transitory moment , rather due adolescence . Holden thrive crave state flux like flaneur . Holden stuck within mutable . His transition child adult requires position within luminal space adolescence ; Holden ’ status spectator status chosen , setting apart typical flaneur . Holden ’ prescriptive observations ( opposed descriptive approach used flaneur ) , longing imagined , immutable spaces museum Egyptian tomb , characteristics unlike flaneur . His position within observer crowd one pleasure , circumstance. ” Please forgive misspelling flâneur I mobile lazy , lol . Also , paper college grammar/development ideas little rough . Basically , I asked explore whether Holden could thought flaneur : yes . However , I think answer complicated question suggests ( ’ questions involving literature ? ) . Charles Baudelaire describes flaneur figure craves instability ever-changing moment , especially urban city space continual modernization . The flaneur often male ( even defined earlier writings ) due unique privileged view world . A man often move spaces virtually unnoticed , often subject , never object ( obviously always true , purposes I ’ running ) . When think depictions women within urban spaces , easily sexualize , describe , categorize ( much like Holden various women interacts novel ) —yet never subject . However , Holden true flaneur ( least I believe ) , within ever-changing moment adolescent . Adolescence , I argued paper , liminal space object child ( virtually agency ) , eventually male adult , subject ( privilege agency ) . I end paper naming Holden proto-flaneur : teen struggling belonging self-creation , meaning potential flaneur put crisis inability thrive yearn instability . He constantly looking static , safe , unmoving ( pay attention interacts spaces like museum especially younger sister ) . While Holden certainly exists within transitory , Holden actively rejects space , thereby rejects role fully formed flaneur . I hope interesting ! I love thinking Holden ’ relation innocence unchanged well powerful position embody male teen/about-to-be adult . Much say self-reflection goes explaining mental-health professional , well .

I think beautiful novel , I find Holden sympathetic character , even though little shit . Holden clearly traumatized , emotionally disturbed kid , actions reflect . As character , lot . The catcher rye metaphor profound way explaining Holden mindset . Him desperately wanting stop others losing innocence , grow , trouble dealing emerging adulthood . I think quintessential coming-of-age story . ",1
11446,"Ah , memories . Catcher Rye first real English book . By real I mean unadapted unabridged . And I struggling , reading , I looked many words dictionary . Some time twenty-thirty pages later inner eyes opened ( I properly described feeling I never experienced language including native one ) . I started guess meaning words without looking . More . By end book I could read much better understanding language skyrocketed . To day author book feel like home . A cozy comfortable feeling . Maybe I subjective I believe Catcher Rye fantastic book , full deep meaning . I loved Holden . Holden person stand lied refuses lie . Not surface , inside . He sees inside people relationships crushes . His attempt escape society feels almost absurd author felt . The author later fled society lived life hermit . ",1
11451,"I little late party , I wanted share I sort opposite experience novel . When I read 14 , I frustrated Holden I remember teacher saying lot teenagers either identified Holden sort literary crush , feeling like bullshit , could anyone drawn insufferable character ? Then later I re-read book , I college , realized I probably disliked Holden I unwilling admit much I could identify , I younger . In sort ironic hypocrisy , I felt Holden phony always phony everyone else . As young adult re-reading novel , I realized yes , Holden WAS phony , I , , expecting impossible level sincerity everyone I encountered , including fictional characters . What I also saw I re-read book , made fall love adult , way Salinger able portray Holden pain desperation , descent ( struggle ) kind madness , without hitting reader head . I think often ignored novel taught high schools , curricula tend focus novel coming-of-age story , really story kind fear darkness many teenagers experience , usually n't consume way Holden .

This shown clearly love sister Phoebe deceased brother Allie . Salinger also writes Holden boy obsessed death . Holden admires death notices preserves image person time death . Allie grow phony like Holden older brother death makes impossible . Salinger details life depressed kid n't know going life .

It easy write Houlden whiny , rich white boy . I time , I came appreciate Houlden brought YA fiction . He made teenagers worthy character studies . He gave voice voiceless still . I sure would one favorite novels , Forgive Me , Leonard Peacock , n't The Catcher The Rye ( I highly recommend way ) . So yeah hat goes J.D .

11475,"32 . Just finished . Now favorite book . I think age probably affects reader ’ interpretation large degree . Was gon na give copy 12 year old son I think I ’ hold ’ older . Edit : Came back touch discourse I see online surrounding book also elaborates original point . I see lot opinions claiming Holden whiny brat . But seemingly unnoticed ironic fashion , lots opinions sound whiny bratty . I could see would come way teenage crowd . Even friends disregard frequent philosophical musings . His brain “ typical ” “ normal ” teenager . He ’ want big football game , trauma going etc . could waved away “ teenage angst ” whole lot going . He real life shit happen tbh I ’ think Salinger began scratch surface , albeit intentionally , ’ Holdens nature terribly reminiscent vulnerable . I also wanted point comment I saw thread . Someone said ’ really appreciate book child , read college brought tears . I cried 3 times reading . > ! First two times Holden cried . The last Phoebe pulled briefcase . ! < I think adult empathize Holden see child sorely needs guidance desires unattainable peace mind . As child , may view annoying ’ supposed older cool kid ’ . Also , without going tragedy navigating perilous mental turmoil nihilism common afterward , many young people lucky experienced yet , harder understand . This may sound strange , many times throughout life I finally got around enjoying piece content , book movie , song , whatever , I familiar decades title alone . And finishing I would realize I attempted take content youth , I would grossly misinterpreted appreciated .. feels preordained times . Like things come across path perfect stage life consciousness particularly specific state designed maximum enjoyment content . I mean , last name Holder day I still get called sometimes work . That created immediate connection Holden . The way described becoming excited times finally found conversation actually enjoyed , I became aware , I happen actually New York , Holdens descriptions Pencey reminded time Army etc , among many subtle similarities . Anyway , To answer OPs question , > ! Catcher reference poem . Holden misinterpreted poems meaning fit perception world . That truly remarkable detail introduced author kind goes everything I said . He wanted Catcher Rye protect children , signifying probably wished could caught fell ( also highlights unprocessed grief brother classmate ) . But kid sister Phoebe , one corrected mistaking poems lyrics , elucidated “ point ” book last scene . Holden eased concern safety resolving ’ always protect children . If fall reaching something truly desire , let go . ! < You ’ welcome . Side note : banning book conjures word mind starts r longer politically correct . You talk grabbing women .. President whole god bless-ed United States pitchforks come references making , prostitution , atheism underage drinking . This country ass backwards sometimes . ",1
11476,"The thing Catcher Rye lot times , yes . These times went 30-40 years current young people n't feel way , . People younger already acclimated completely changed society immediately n't understand stulting normalcy forced 50-80s . The norm person great . The norm back conform * super * rigid cultural ideal meant person . Holden Caufield wanted catch people rye got cultural norm . It impossible translate day age lot ways .

The definition norm changed one specific vision reality ( house , suburbs , wife , two kids , car ) include almost manners human existence . You understand many people would n't accept going 30 years ago ( tattoos , piercings , dyed hair , music , porn , language , etc . ) Holden refusal mature sake childish creativity harbinger creativity came ( n't cause lead lot people open mind new world ) . You generations mine already open . Imagine mind closed book came . Imagine world seeming really small wanted something else . * shrug * ",1
11478,"I really think come . My parents raised Prussian Model including religious grade school military high school . My entire life correct way speak , think , even feel scripted .

11485,One real characters I ever read . For The Catcher Rye perfect portrait teenage years . ,1

I teenage girl typically n't read types books though I idea I 'do n't get ' I n't much fan even I tried remember context behind book classic . I n't forced read school I went way read one English teacher favorites . I n't find enthralling read , boring even taking account time published . ",0
11495,I wrote huge essay The Catcher Rye terrible least full page dedicated explaining JD Salinger suck eggs . ,0
11496,"> It , similarly The Bell Jar , gave voice concerns people dared talk time . You remember temporal context , really transgressive came . So Franny Zooey , much deeper The Catcher , yet applauded recognized . > Plus , anyone read without struggle . Sometimes short , simple , point better way drive home point compared deep meandering . Franny Zooey actually much shorter The Catcher Rye ( almost 100 pages ) . And also simple follow , The Catcher Rye follows Holden lot places deals quite bit characters storylines , Franny Zooey takes place almost entirely one area centers primarily two characters one storyline . I guess thing I understand rare see books marketed young adults time , even topic , popular , celebrate book ( I think ) writing content rather first kind . Which n't make sense . ",1
11497,"People never depressed , lost tired sytem wo n't get like book . If someone always question everything seems like person whiny others , love book . Some people tried get . From system/society . They tried get like Caulfield realize entirely reasons settle conformity instead point losing individuality . I like book . It one favorites . But I need mood read . Sometimes , Caulfield toxic . But I like I teenage years . I like time time , always questioning world . Sure , The Catcher Rye maybe boring Caulfield seems like whiny jerk .

His voice full resentment loneliness time confused wants life , wanting respected young adult time wanting loved child . Stuck somewhere , brink adulthood quite . I believe us Holden Caulfield somewhere inside us managed tame hide . Now , I need reread . ",1
11498,"First , I say * The Perks Being Wallflower * would exist without * The Catcher Rye * . I understand , many people , dislike novel . However , I think meets eye . The simplicity underlies complex Holden . He suffering sort mental illness repressed much childhood , sometimes storytelling like listening child talk : repetitive goes nowhere ( try listening 5-7 year tell story haha ) . Holden clearly stuck past clinging also hoping grow find . I hope re-read point , I believe book affects differently various ages life . I loved I 16 , hated I 21 , fell love I 25 . Just two cents , take 'em leave 'em ! : - ) ",1
11502,"I read I younger , probably 12-13 years old , I enjoyed way written , I could identify Holden . I found affluent crybaby . However , later life I read 'Less Than Zero ' Bret Easton Ellis , Ellis one time favorites authors , I made connection protagonist Clay Holden similar many ways .

11504,"The thing * Catcher * people invariably acknowledge discussing Holden /r/books * * two different Holden Caulfields ; * * Holden telling story Holden story told . Holden gone west stay brother madman stuff happened kicked Pency year later sitting reflect , also tell readers story . Holden throughout entirety book reflecting , things person one year ago .

11505,"You know , The Great Gatsby The Catcher Rye actually kind similar , I think . The Great Gatsby heavily centered around Gatsby holding onto wishful , imaginary version perceives “ pure , innocent ” girl . This girl someone used love . Years years later still , continues devote life impressing girl obsessed mental image “ pure , innocent ” , “ perfect ” girl . Whereas The Catcher Rye , Holden obsessed idea saving “ innocent , pure ” children “ monstrous ” puberty , see tells Phoebe wanting devote life saving imaginary children falling imaginary cliff . The two books different messages , though ; The Great Gatsby idealizing person , The Catcher Rye speaks preservation innocence , well many things . Funnily , Holden met Gatsby , man mansion meant simply impress girl , would hate “ phony ” . ",1

That ’ point book : ’ trying hold adolescence , ’ world says “ , fuck you. ” He * * move adulthood , Holden lot things keeping trapped childhood/adolescence ; grief death brother never got , possible abuse , witnessing death classmate , etc .

To , universalness Holden ’ story , trying find place adult world ( disillusionment usually accompanies time ) makes book worth reading . It ’ something I think everyone relate way . And Salinger intentionally gives us unlikeable protagonist challenge , make us see * everyone * ( even privileged , whiny brats ) searching place belong world . But , I ’ expert , ’ two cents ! ",1
11515,"Teenage angst new concept The Catcher In The Rye came . Nowadays culture steeped , time , I suppose TCITR seen fresh honest time popular portrayals teenage life first love , malt shops , football games , frat parties .

11516,"I surprised book n't relatable younger generation readers . Holden cynical world , run phonies , pessimistic future .

I could looked mirror convinced ( smug pride ) * I * Holden Caulfield , probably fool friends well . Which Holden Caulfield thing I could done . I see lot disillusioned , cynical young people today , upset failures older generation , wanting much make world better , without clear direction . That I surprised relatable 2020 .

11524,"I never liked Holden , * The Catcher Rye * still one favorite books . ",1
11525,"I suggest reading Franny Zooey Salinger next . It expands idea , particularly using character Franny sort Holden 2.0 ( also great book fav Salinger ) . Like Holden , Franny gets obsession phony everyone everything , unlike strong support system knows dealing steer towards right answers ( basically family Antolinis ) . Throughout Catcher , Holden alone thoughts correct somethings reason think , needs someone bounce bring Earth . Antolini n't really time give guidance needs , advice gives core Holden needs . While Holden disillusioned , really needs set ideology think wants ( aka wants live ) . In mind Holden creative , n't realized yet ( maybe Actor Director ) . Which Antolini trying tell take time realize . This feeling aimlessness one many youths deal book relatable formative years . Antolini says , The mark immature man wants die nobly cause mark mature man wants live humbly one . Basically , I feel , Holden go back school like Antolini suggests probably find thing draws wants dedicate life . In real world , usually happens . Some people know want early age , many , like Holden , particularly aimless throughout High School go College studying think 're exposed one thing feel 're truly meant . That period Holden excruciatingly dull one . But , thoughts throughout book shows thinker great potential Antolini sees tries help ignite spark advice . Once , Franny Zooey uses themes beautifully , defined questions answers . Also , character Franny Zooey suggested written The Catcher Rye making book-in-a-book . But , important thing pull idea character Franny Zooey wrote Holden knowledge thought process . And , read , definitely see struggles Holden relate struggles Glass Family member .

11529,"I think The Catcher Rye great book first book kind . Before , someone else pointed , n't anyone writing much could suck teenager ; reading , sure , seems dated , seems like well traveled ground , lots books exploring themes .

11530,"One top five best reads ever . I first read I age Holden Caufield back 1980 I completely identified Holden mental struggles . This testament Salinger writing ability situation life different Holden . Holden rich advantages life . I poor advantages . But shared common view came social interaction . I saw people phonies developed cynical view world . Now , much older person , I realize I really searching meaningful human interaction n't getting . Perhaps finding The Catcher Rye meaningful long ago internet social media existed , time mental health issues get attention deserve . I felt like I kindred spirit connect Holden . Holden suffering form PTSD due death younger brother , getting type counseling needed friends elders . I suffered trauma addressed proper way , I suffered silence I aware begin help . And I ostracized others , like Holden . I think modern reader must put historical perspective . Salinger writing World War 2 macho time American culture . Boxing popular sport professional football example . Soldiers returning horrors war mental struggles virtually recourse . If could n't handle normal life , put nut house subjected treatments find cruel today ( hydro treatments , electric shock , etc. ) . So successfully address mental illness sensitive manner tremendous achievement Salinger . ",1
11532,"Yeah exactly . Just today I watching video book person basically said book boy hates everything things grown teenager . And also bad person . I ca n't look Holden way , book processing trauma , dealing trauma beautifully captured opinion . Even I think self aware character , least granted - scene describes sister wants catcher rye , catch ones rye n't fall cliff already knows etc ( definitely reference Salinger going army quite young ) - I liked scene cab asked driver ducks , go waters frozen , first I n't really look I think kind never gets answers authority figures wishes instead hurt ( already mentioned , CSA etc . ) - sorry long reply ",1

I think also pretty clear Holden struggling feelings depression anxiety given loss brother Allie general anxieties growing . I always feel great deal sympathy Holden I heard lot people describe whiny unlikable . Teenagers generally pretty whiny unlikable , especially ones struggling .

11543,"My brother reading catcher rye high school talking . I read freshman high school identified Holden pretty hard . 7 years fact , I came conversations thinking I n't like book anymore I n't feel like Holden Caulfield , I wrong . I think Catcher worthy read successfully places character Holden Caulfield world whole , convincing way reader , rather getting sense JD Salinger approves disapproves Holden , feel Holden much way would questions Holden already answered . The best example way I read book comes episode takes place middle book , sudden Holden wants run away life Sally would live together later would get married would chop wood winter everything . Holden describes situation first person , clear unreasonable expectations Sally n't think expectations would apply . Sally n't stressed whole world messed way Holden , n't really want run away everything . Instead understanding subjective point left field proposition Sally , Holden describes pissed unreasonable . Sally tells yelling Holden tells reader n't yelling , becomes clear unreliable narrator . The way I read high school still easiest way read today , , totally identify main character become absorbed world . The problem book like Catcher Rye , point book understand Holden author point view , rather . [ Edit one year : I would put differently . I would say way The Catcher Rye written , reader n't learn JD Salinger thinks people like Holden , reader sees * * think person like Holden Caulfield . As youngster , I thought hilarious honest . Recently , I found someone shares many bad qualities , ( terrible listener matters , little perspective warmth towards life world ) . Maybe one thing objective Holden , nervous person , n't know sure wants life . I think reflects quality writing I could read language story sympathizer think JD corner , 7 years later take words feel though Salinger making argument I think Holden scary sad . ] ",1
11544,"From technical side things , stylistic masterpiece . That alone makes worth reading , I put lot stock author style . Not everybody , nothing wrong . That said , I teenager anymore I still find ways relate Holden . I met older people read first time , , well , found ways relate . I think timeless thing changed lingo . But , hey , n't like The Catcher Rye , pick Franny Zooey . For money , Salinger best book . ",1
11546,"The fig tree rang true . Hit right gut great literature . To relate w Catcher In The Rye comparison , Holden talks one moment make fall love , one passage book impactful made whole book worth . Also , Ryan Adams song called Sylvia Plath . ",1
11547,I glad see someone else making The Catcher Rye comparison book ! I always thought The Bell Jar feminine The Catcher Rye . When I read college much easier relate reason . It felt really refreshing issues addressed woman perspective woman voice . ,1
11548,The Catcher Rye one books absolutely re-read every years . I read every year since I 18 I always find new angle due little older little wiser . It okay n't feel like understand right . ,1
11549,"Hi . When I 16 I read The catcher Rye . I always enjoyed fantasy YA , Rye lead Classics . Since I read genre . I read many books impacted Rye . Slaughterhouse 5 , Lolita , Animal farm , 1984 maybe The brother Karamazov , would . They feel . Perhaps wait till summer Karamazov , It requires much energy focus . But worth . Hope I could help .

11550,"He n't want . He aware . He change . That wishes catcher rye . His growing , education world , loss innocence goes wrong fully aware . So much mental breakdown . Plus , shit ton reasons Holden way , would know J.D . life ( mostly WWII pretty much fucked right ) order see came book . It brilliant book . If ca n't appreciate need go back try start scratch basic literary concepts . ",1
11552,"Hey , ’ , OP . 😂 I realize Holden phony , things said ’ necessary wrong . They might wrong coming someone like , without focusing much , I think said valid things probably needed said , whether intended point Salinger . Then whole thing boils adulthood struggle conformity , really wan na save freedom fear judgement , freedom fear failure , freedom speak mind , etc experience child . The Catcher In The Rye whole book many valid points I ’ seen discussed in-depth . Well , honestly , Catcher ’ even go in-depth . But I digress . ",1
11553,"> His complaints phoniness modern life universal loss innocence accurate ( mention distaste dumb Hollywood cinema ) . I fan The Catcher Rye , pretty terrible society dismiss people feel childish . Really n't seem strange see people often fake society general frequently ridiculous . But hard express way n't make sound like angsty-teen . I could n't stand Holden , even teenager . I feel empathy someone felt stuck outside society obviously personal problems . ",0
11556,"Catcher Rye seems get lot hate subreddit , I think undeserved . Everyone says Holden Caufield whiny entitled brat wo n't shut phonies . But everyone seems forget kid . He depressed kid watched one brother die young another brother turn prostitute . His parents shipped boarding , gets finds peers arent thinking things forced face early age . Not mention kid jumps window ( wearing Holdens sweater ! ) really pushes views even leaning towards whats point ? He spends entire book basically motivation helping kids , trying protect children . The whole wanting catcher rye catching kids fall cliff thought Holden keeps wanting save kids shit ca n't save kid eventually grow . Between parents , sister , prostitute , teacher goes see , Holden Caulfield wants someone comfort save wondering cliff rye fields . ",1
11562,"The Catcher In The Rye deep touching book . What I liked best much I could relate Holden , angst thoughts world lives , actions takes story . I also like loose writing style , story little plot , n't know going happen next . This definitely favorite book . ",1
11563,"I making point hard digest read past certain age . It comes petulant repetitive . But silly , I guess adding opinion thread title What people opinions 'The Catcher Rye ' ? welcome . ",0
11565,"This another good interpretation Holden mindset . And I think major part plot book purpose per say , Holden lost . He lost life ever since Allie died , questioning meaning life . And unable find , thus I think journey takes upon find answer . He reaches finalization Adulthood ends , points time maturity takes innocence held perished . He wants catcher rye prevent kids growing . Growing fast enjoying , way describing high school think We teens preoccupied growing , becoming adult want able drink , drive ( together xD ) , etc . He wants everyone stop wait take breather . This perspective I think Holden trying say us . Sorry length yea . ",1
11566,"Theres one big reason I dont give shit detractor says Catcher Rye : ending absolutely beautiful , gorgeous , beyond amazing writing . Holden dream catcher rye protect children going cliff absolutely reason classic literature , anyone bothered hypocritical nature honestly afraid look deeply inside see contradictory human beings - gorgeous book ",1
11568,"It awhile since I read * The Catcher Rye * . I n't like reasons . I going lie ; biggest reason probably I read school . I ca n't really think school-assigned novels I actually liked ( maybe ATOTC , fair I read twice assigned , IIRC ) . The Catcher Rye also n't type book I like . I prefer conventional writing styles . I really interested reading every little thing character thinks . And fucking tangents goes aggravating read . And I dislike Holden whiny child . Yes , understandably * * whiny , n't mean I like constant complaints . I admit large part reason I dislike Holden * * way story told story would n't told different way . Maybe I due re-reading , I doubt I bring . I really like book . Also , standard interpretation Holden probably sexually abused one teacher ? I remember reading scene Holden sleeping teacher couch class someone brought possibility , IIRC teacher said like fatherly thing something . ",0
11569,"The problem The Catcher Rye people n't catch symbolism n't realize real story portrays society ( NY 50s ) . Holden n't understand likes red hunting hat much . This ( opinion ) color favorite person , brother , Allie hair . There many subtleties people n't pay attention . And people n't like Holden character n't understand Holden . His entire life tries get people listen one ever . By end book , realize gotten listen/read story ( assuming n't forced read English class something ) . Also , surrounded bunch pretentious assholes complete idiots ( sound familiar ? ) . Holden refuses accept world sees worse society , others overlook . ",0
11570,"And add topic innocence adulthood : Holden distinguish whether innocent mature . He drinks smokes bring sex ( back would less common teen sex ) . Once sees prostitute seemingly age notices n't want cross line seeing prostitute probably terrible life . All around people seem know , Phoebe obviously innocent , Stradlater , Ackley n't care , DB far past transition state . Even though Holden tries keep innocence ( talking Phoebe , girl park , listening boy sing Catcher Rye song ) ca n't escape fact aging . This evident favorite line book : That whole trouble . You ca n't ever find place nice peaceful , n't . You may think , get , 're looking , somebody sneak write 'Fuck You ' right nose . ",1
11571,"I n't think fair say Holden n't change * * . I mean , whole story nobody listening empathizing , year later , found way tell story empathize .

He realizes catcher rye * * caught . ",1
11573,The Catcher Rye - Reading adolescent must ,1
11574,"Read first time couple weeks ago I love . I guess I lucky read school ? The novel lends binge read since long , writing straightforward , n't much complexity plot ( literally Holden going place place throughout week ) . * The Catcher Rye * great job expressing frustrating interval childhood adulthood , way make Holden seem like real person * * mouthpiece author . This novel kills , really . The funny thing , I ca n't relate Holden whole lot , written well feels like I sympathize rather empathize . That makes great novel . I going reread second I finish * Of Mice Men * later afternoon get back , I noticing trend I need break . ",1
11575,"No , The Catcher In The Rye n't controversial read . I feel like I much common ground main character . Sometimes I want things , . Not everything needs rational explanation justified . ",1
11581,"I always thought Catcher Rye someone fearing change fearing control , end coming terms change happens situations occur control . I think people dislike book already found way cope things understand somebody would whiny . He growing . These people forgot grow ! Then people n't experiences situation beyond control upsetting ca n't relate . I guess feel privileged , weary one day situation occur acting like Holden . I feel people enjoy book either currently going situation hard cope people STILL remember hard grow enjoy book teenager learning valuable lesson learned still remember . You ca n't catcher rye . Life work like Holden realizes . That people realizing realized still look back . I feel people ones enjoy book . I always feared change like things change ( like Holden n't like ducks go ! He wants things stay although insignificant , duck thing shows problem change ) . The book , although life changing , allow see things control let go . Just Holden , seeing sister end , realized ca n't change anything enjoy time currently sister ! That I got book I like lot . Hope makes sense I bed . ",1

We must learn find inner children . So focus , least everyone get message book , even n't remember prose whatnot like . ",1
11585,"I think The Catcher Rye fantastic book I would argue Holden one best realised character fiction . I first read book I 17 read several times since . I think two things keep mind examining Holden personality . One , Holden teenager . This may seem obvious seems ignored people dislike . Anyone half brain knows teenage years suck . Your body changing , 're edge adulthood 're coming realisation soon leave childhood behind . This difficult enough without mentioning school , work , managing family friends . In experience , teenage years time great uncertainty teens n't experience maturity deal . The second thing keep mind comes Holden pretty fucking traumatized . Not deal teenager fact flunking school n't like look world adults enter , also dealing serious psychological issues . Holden lost younger brother Allie , one people genuinely felt connection . Not feel great pain loss brother also punishes times mean ( like said Allie could n't come friends ) . Holden reveals smashed parent garage Allie died badly hurt hands smashing glass . Holden relationship parents also distant . They n't bad people clear 're quite distant children , especially since Allie died . He ca n't exactly talk going . Holden also mentions mother full nerves since lost youngest son , yet another thing Holden concerned . Holden also seems good relation brother , D.B . since moved Hollywood away Holden . This really leaves Holden kid sister phoebe lot younger n't emotionally mature enough understand going . Holden also seems affected suicide classmate , James Castle , jumped bedroom window bullied . The boy wearing Holden turtleneck sweater died Holden says , boy covered Mr Antolini placed jacket . That pretty messed . Holden lot shit stuck head one talk lives time n't focus much attention mental health . He n't internet almost way meet like-minded people . People going difficulties like n't much fun around I think Holden actually pretty well considering baggage holden ( could n't resist ) . People say Holden whiny character kind missing point two ways . Firstly , teenager , teenagers whiny . Secondly , also got lot emotional baggage . There great video review [ Blog Brothers ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ZSR8J6LUaT8 ) I feel sums Holden character pretty well . In response criticism Holden Caulfield , narrator The Catcher Rye unlikable , I regret inform also unlikable , I . There weird pervasive feeling world contemporary coming age fiction characters ought either person want person want , I happy confirm Holden Caulfield neither guy wan na guy wan na . He Edward Cullen . It also worth remembering essentially two Holden novel . Holden went events , Holden telling events . The older Holden aware comes across novel often describes maniac , immature , dumb . He self aware different year later . Anyway , food thought . ",1
11588,"I loved * The Catcher Rye * I loved Holden . Narrators n't necessarily pleasant relatable , I think made clear character . Once learn look past abrasiveness , see confused , frightened child hiding inside . Even I would n't use words express , I remember sharing many feelings Holden , primarily disgust people acting phony despair lack authenticity grown-up world . For reasons I connected I protagonists . ",1

Many things addresses may seem irrelevant us big issues time ( 19th-Century Eurpoean philosophies nihilism making inroads among educated wanna-be educated Russia ) , many psychological issues timeless . In words , read Dostoevsky like literature ( ) . By , I mean , keep eye might saying immediately apparent . I yet read * The Idiot * ( I looking forward getting around someday ) , I ca n't recommend * Crime Punishment * * The Brothers Karamazov * highly enough .

I n't really know I talking , I trying say Dostoevsky uses techniques express mystery heart existence way artists . ",1

But , alas , failing , since Dostoevskij felt n't manage reach goal . To , The Idiot book n't able complete wished . I think two elements consider look book . It touches lot themes main one failure Myskin save Nastasya , another beautiful soul corrupted ( raped child ) , torn Myskin love Rogozin , nemesis .

11769,"The Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin noted virtually Dostoevsky main characters defined experience threshold , unable move towards half-formed image way could ( society could ) unwilling move back either . This produces strange sort hysteria , oscillates agony ecstasy , actively resists simplification character archetype . As Bakhtin put : Dostoevsky always represents person threshold final decision , moment crisis , unfinalizable , unpredeterminable , turning point soul . To modern readers , aspect work feel little zany anachronistic , lean , effect still powerful . Of course , important see Dostoevsky writings context , seems hear music distant rooms n't fully located within lifetime . Whether pre-articulation Nietzsche , whose ideas seem found inspiration confirmation Dostoevsky novels , particularly Crime & Punishment Karamazov . More importantly , although work predates Freud , often see Dostoevsky intuitive sense subconscious , particularly tendency turn inexplicable gesture statement — Lise privately crushing finger door humiliating Alyosha Karamazov , Myshkin trying hide face corner slapped Ganya The Idiot . He playwright instinct dramatic scene construction harmonic dissonant potentials dialogue , especially later work . Bakhtin phrased aspect Dostoevsky attempt write polyphonic novel , clustering separate , hyper-realised voices could allow characters reader perceive broader perspective , indeed without external perspectives , impossible wholly known oneself others .

11785,"The Idiot Dostoevsky . Still potentially favourite book , first Dostoevsky novel I read imo probably relatable . So many books I read since much less enjoyable ever since cuz ca n't compare . Also , totally glad u say 'The Road , ' next book I plan reading . I met Tim Kasher Cursive The Good Life months ago recommended book claiming It probably considered first * * great novel * * 21st century ",1
11787,"I think little . Dostoevsky suspicious Western Enlightenment thinking , n't deny value entirely . Rather , thought useful powerful way viewing world , lacking moral basis . In opinion , Russia two halves make great country , lacked way uniting . The Russian upper class become westernized lost contact roots , lower class retained virtue spirituality , outdated left behind advancing west . His 'pochvennichestvo ' political ideology sought heal Russia saw thing could reunite two groups : Orthodox church , merging Christianity ( western ) traditional Russian values . Many Dostoevsky characters seek sometimes call 'binding idea ' bring country together , sought well . For example , * The Idiot * Myshkin speaks often unifying idea could bring everyone together , experiences something like idea height epileptic fits ( implied religious ) . Myshkin much represents ideal combining Europe Russia , born Russia spent much life Switzerland . In * Crime Punishment , * Raskolnikov throughout much book mentions uneasy feels around peasants low-class people Petersburg . He certainly one westernized Russians point , fluent western ideas writing little connection traditional roots ( see isolation family ) . But , pay attention epilogue - soon embraces religion Sonya , feels sudden fellowship comradery prisoners . This , I think , Dostoevsky central political theme . Not Westernism needs rejected entirely , needs melded traditional Russian values . ",1

I like say better ) . Nowadays I prefer teach rather practice , still turn Eragon prime example world-building versus common ones like Tolkein . In hindsight , best book series ? Not . It dragged places . I disliked ending . I feel like Brisingr novel superfluous series . But gave light life really difficult time gave hobby helped cope . I never got interact like , really makes ( inner teenager ) glad person I looked long awesome reality I pictured . ",1
11884,"So I look timelines I could accurate . Eragon came , self-published , way back 2001 . Then got republished back 2003 . I remember reading back I middle school . Say 2007 , 2008 . I would 12 13 . I remember one friends , reading book , told older brother read . And told author wrote 15 . That first got seriously interested . I caught Harry Potter time . That means I read Goblet Fire , Order Phoenix , Half-Blood Prince . Read Nancy Drew I care admit , decent bit Hardy Boys , found Sherlock Holmes . Anything Rick Riodan hot potatoes social circles . The Edge Chronical plentiful , good length knock weekend . Any Artemis Fowl book good light reading day time . Animorphs Goosebumps also could lunch break , study period gap . You get idea , I spent time reading , eating . The Bartimaeus sequence recently new find , good chunk bite . Something actually satiated appetite . Made slow bit I chewed . A decent book texture characters . The plotline driven one desire . Inkheart scratched similar itches . I read Adventures Huckleberry Finn Tangerine English class . I could put work finish something . If I n't enjoying I read . That n't matter . What mattered I finished story . So I I sitting , listening friend , tell book , 15 year old wrote . How fantasy , dragons , people could ride . There supernatural enemies , magic , elves , sword fighting . Naturally , I listened politely enthusiasm . Inwardly , I skeptical , cause I agree , elements cool ; I n't think I could write story 15 , I want read 13 . I needed know stuff , right ? To even make story worth someone else time . So I eye-ing book , estimating might take week . Maybe weekend , I lazy , focusing books . When done , I give shot . He finishes , lets borrow . I pretty sure I got Tuesday . I gave back Thursday . Within next month I copy . Since I kept releases Inheritance Cycle . I ever thankful Christopher Paolini , proving wrong . For showing keen imagination piece art , worth spending time , made 15 year old . That n't take adult , decades experience rely , make book worth reading . I super excited read something . Having grown palate sci-fi Herbert , Asimov , Stephenson , ~~His-name-who-shall-ever-be-forgotten~~ ^^orson ^^scott ^^card ; I expect Paolini bless us wonderful read grace shelves . Or add e-book collections . Who cares , reading . Edit : formatting es dificil ",1
11885,"Eragon slow sure , kind slog get . But I found 2 books highly enjoyable except cliffhanger ending . ",1
11887,"Really ? Bit surprise . I recall back day something staying away criticism . Which , course , drew bunch criticism . But , really n't good books . The hype 15-year-old wrote , somehow time mass media forgetting things like fictionpress fanfiction big time , filled teenagers writing short stories enormous epics . I hope acknowledge criticisms , though . There surprising amount value . Personally , I found much become good writer deconstructing works like Eragon ( among others ) I classically good works The Lord Rings . Which means tools correct deficiencies . ",0
11888,Did try collection short stories released recently Eragon setting ? I actually thought pretty decent . Had levity experimentation . Felt like happy deepen world without drop full novel . ,1
11889,"Nope , . I critic , I understand n't invent elves dwarves characteristics etc , I re-read books many , many times every time pleasure . The interactions eragon saphira , main character killed needed , clearly grew stronger time went , fun read . ",1
11890,I ’ M WITH YOU I LOVED THE ERAGON SERIES . I LOVED EVERY BOOK . ,1
11891,I thought final battle clever resolution situation kind wrote corner ( magic duels mostly mental plus Galbatorix objectively ten times powerful smarter ) . Having Eragon leave afterward felt forced wrote first book . ,1
11893,"I distinctly recall watching Eragon theaters thinking man , plot beats seems really similar . Then , scene breaks princess holding cell , hit . I leaned friend said n't little short storm trooper ? ",0
11894,I thought Eragon fucking amazing . Also eragon unoriginal 99 % fantasy unoriginal ,1
11895,"I remember loving Chronicles Prydain I middle school . I tried reread years ago , force get first . They awful . Just terrible . I ended stopping , I could retain fond memories books . I read Eragon back first came , I n't finish series . I thought alright , n't really buy hype much friends . The difference two one wrote dumbed-down story kids , one kid trying write intelligent story . I n't think I ever go back reread Eragon , Christopher Paolini respect wanting make something good . Also , never try reread stories liked young . It rarely ends well . ",0
11897,"Eragon rip-off Star Wars . Maybe time prequels , Galactic Senate controlled evil chancellor . ",0
11898,My favorite bit magic definitely True Name thing applying people . Eragon learning true name sword shit got * real * ? My high school self lost collective shit moment . ,1
11899,I amazed Eragon nuked Galbatorix . ,1
11902,"Agreed ! ! I started reading Eragon I 8 years old something made whole childhood , I read lot books ones ever immersive . I really felt like I personal connection books characters I even attempted learn phrases fictional language used haha . I look back fond memories like book series could ever given . ",1
11904,"I hated Arya bitch , Eragon goes . I like pairing EragonxSaphira . ",0
11905,"Basically Eragon gets ship fucks , Urgals Dwarves pulled Riders . Also Arya Ergaon share kiss fucks . ",0
11906,"Right ? It funny Star Wars derivative , even , George Lucas never made effort hide . Hell , even called film making style collage , talked length - yet lauded critics public , yet Paolini others get called hacks much thing . I guessing halo effect . People liked A New Hope , Lucas ( prequels ) virtuoso sense picking right masterpieces assimilate work , Eragon , calling rip nice way validate opinion book garbage . ",0
11908,"> After decade 're still making fun 16 year old author able get published No , 're making fun 18 year old author ( Eragon published ) published parents talked thesaurus-driven teenage fantasy masterpiece . Plenty kids dipped creative writing written works good better Eragon - none parents publish . God I hate people like . Let people opinions take righteous ass . ",0
11909,Yeah . But ’ different mate . It ’ far blatant . You ’ seriously think plot Star Wars Hidden fortress similar Eragon Star Wars . And underlying motives completely different Star Wars Hidden Fortress . Eragon ? Yeah . Lot straight . Eragon bad writing poor world building . People need put aside childhood fondness . ,0
11911,"Eragon basically mashup good high fantasy books . good fanfiction , .. wrote 15 .. perfect , good . & # x200B ; I wish re-wrote mature ; ) ",1
11912,"Lmao thats perfect way describe I agree , I love concept warding mental magical battles used . I always got sense magic Eragon universe deadly dangerous , powerful magic-users able kill instantly whisper pretty cool . ",1
11913,"I actually learned something really interesting books . At first I n't like Eragon brother chapters . I wanted get back magic elves shit . But dude ended much cooler clever . I realized * underpowered * space become interesting character . It something Jim Butcher talked , handicapping characters means creative solutions . ",1
11914,"I could sit read I picked Eragon 3rd grade . As 8 9 year old , book culmination interests ( mainly dragons ) put right direction towards Rick Riordan series , Lotr , Harry Potter , etc . Have n't reread Paolini books since still stand near pinnacle fantasy genre . ",1
11915,"There lots little scenes conversations Eragon feeling saying everything went last book n't really worth , good experiences n't make suffering . There subplot facing fact fight lots soldiers stop Galbatorix , soldiers mostly regular dudes option . You know , general tone , questions many things glossed Eragon . And comes , favourite conversation history literature , I mean . The Elves festival celebrate every 100 years , every citizen guest ( like Eragon ) expected bring something created , show front whole city . Some people bring artistic creations , make performance , smiths make cool weapons jewelry , get . And Eragon n't single clue heck , kid found dragon egg , elves far better everything . So writes poem meant compete quality , explain The Chosen One meant , writes language magic , means speak words thinks true . He shows poem master , asks give honest opinion . He says kinda bad . Like , know , readable , meh . But also says Eragon telling something matters , story real true , something personal , something people relate , another type value . And I dumb teenager reading dumb fantasy stories , I read chapter thought , hey , n't story made characters , story made human person trying talk , another human person , uses story connect personal level . The actual poem book , exactly bad imagine . But every time I writing something I feel nothing , I think stupid shitty poem , I imagine Paolini thinking : yep , happening , I actually writing fucking poem make point clear going every version , trying make lil better something might good enough , best , something matters point making really really REALLY matters . And helps . It n't solve everything writing hard I good , helps . And I enjoy , sometimes people enjoy stories I share . And pretty fucking cool . ",1
11917,It ’ completely original terms story . The first chapters ( first book ) somewhat follow narrative eragon . Eldest Brisingr ( thus far ) completely different . ,1
11918,"And completely missed point top . The first book Eragons ( emotional ) journey bonding Saphira , Brom Murthag later Orik Arya . The movie cut made almost entirely battle Farthsen Dur , comoektlet missing point . ",0
11922,"> I think Meloni hack , I really know eragon writing , I say wrote really young . First book like 15 16 , I think use tropes cliches bound happen . ",0
11925,"Especially part child blessed cursed Eragon , Paoloni said accident created entire arc n't planned . ",0
11926,"This . Too many authors cautious fully define magic system , people pick apart find every loophole . It make sense core going break way . Harry Potter doesnt explain magic words , make magic spell , even show scientific art wizards end hurting/maiming/killing others/themselves creating new magics . But Eragon good job explaining magic , really turned science energy manipulation . Conversion energy make one thing another , focus light water make fire , moving energy around Paolini great job keeping mysterious vague early , expanding upon across 3 books til full robust system , logic stuff structured magic even came . Even telepathy/affecting others minds . Because ability manipulate magic/energy , pushed consciousness outside touch another mind/energy . Explained , almost seems plausible . ",1
11928,"Hard magic systems new thing fantasy writing . Soft magic systems executed properly also n't 'lol magic ' . Everything Eragon derivative - characters , setting , plot . However , executed well , written cleanly well edited , lot said things , especially given author teenager . ",1
11930,The bit eragon using empathy spell becomes attack Galbatorix hands best writings enjoyed sidestepped whole hopeless ! ,1
11932,"Sure . Eragon rebel army keep conquering city city , , want reach Galbatorix ( main bad guy ) fortress , need keep supply lines safe . Most time disadvantage , need keep army mostly intact final fight , get original storm cities , example , sending small squad infiltrate secret tunnel Dwarves know open city gates . They also figure actually going defeat Galbatorix , cause trapped Eldunari ( basically souls ) dragons died last war , drains lots magic power . While celebrating conquered last city fortress , Nasuada ( rebel leader ) gets kidnapped Murtagh ( Eragon half brother , also dragon rider serves Galbatorix knows true name magic language , forced obey ) . Galbatorix begins torture fer , either force make troops surrender , learn true name . I like books subplot pretty bad . Eragon puts prophecies legends knows together , learns abandoned island fortress old Dragon Riders might secret weapon use Galbatorix . So , Shapira , Glaedr eldunari ( dragon master ) go . They go island ( super cool creatures inspired obscure european mithology ) find Dragon Riders managed hide lots dragon eggs eldunari , deleted memories minds , nobody would find . All rebels group , put together three different plans take Galbatorix , using everything . Both armies begin fight , try sneak kill Galbatorix using invisibility spells , magic begins fail apparent reason , yet nobody attacks . They reach throne room Galbatorix Murthag await , Galbatorix explains n't exactly sitting throne , found true name Magic , means controls magic , literally rewrite rules , whatever wants , control n't perfect yet . He strips everyone powers , makes plans useles , forces Eragon Murthag fight amusement . Eragon tricks Murthag letting cut , wins fight attacking Murthag realizes exposed , Murthag admits always better two willing make sacrifices , changed person watching . That means true name , true self changed , Galbatorix longer controls . He uses true name magic give everyone power back , tries attack Galbatorix , king reacts time , defenses much handle . The rest allies jump , begin attack Galbatorix everything . But enough , matter use , matter hard try , fucking enough , way strong , way win . And Eragon realizes lost , every sacrifice nothing , thinks people counting , wishes Galbatorix understood . So tries one last magic spell , one make Galbatorix understand everything , experience every emotion ever caused , good bad . It real attack , attemp communicate , Galbatorix would never conceive held accountable actions , empatizing anyone , n't set defenses kind spell , goes , much handle , done far bad good , blows magic stop felling pain . Then everyone happy , goes well , except country devastated war , high degree militarization rebellion encouraged every small lord count pillage install small dictatorships , everyone demading compesations , Nasuada tries solve problems , .. hard , really fucking hard , would much easier Eragon went , overpowered every army magic dragon , stopped every rebel mage true name magic . But exactly Galbatorix , know . So Nasuada tries keep solving problems hard way , Eragon flies away country avoid temptation thinking THE RIGHT SOLUTION meddle government , promises teach future dragon riders want , dragon eggs begin hatch . Also Arya becomes dragon rider Roran gets married . The end . ",1
11933,Roran gets married finally allowed stop fixing everyone else problems . Murtagh ca n't get edgy angst fucks east something . He agrees Eragon anyone knows true name magic n't anywhere near position power . ,0
11939,"Not groomed , Eragon rejected publishing houses submitted , parents created publish son book . Not exactly opportunity every 15 year old gets . ",0
11940,"Yeah , halfway decent fantasy kids movie . But basically nothing common Eragon books beyond names vague plot lines . I pretty sure writer ( ) movie wrote screenplay based hearing synopsis book noisy bar ; much common books . ",0
11941,"No problem ! I big * Eragon * fan , even though feels lot immature I first reading . But book great way quickly & lightly revisit world . ",1
11942,"It actually n't . It much , much closely pulled David Eddings , upfront ( Eddings ) following Hero Journey formula used Star Wars ( realize Lucas stated many times formula , right ? A New Hope far first , wo n't last ) . One minor character name Garath . A major character Belgariad Eddings Belgarath , born Garath . The word literally straight dump Belgariad . The difference true name thing done much better several decades earlier Le Guin masterpiece Earthsea novels . Brom literally Belgarath new name . Almost exactly character , minor differences backstory made specifically fit Paolini cookie cutter world pretty obvious blend Brooks ' Shannara Tolkien Middle-Earth . The Elves retreating hidden forests one seem find unless want ? Done first Tolkien ( many say incredibly derivatively ) Brooks original Shannara trilogy ( even beat-for-beat copy Paolini ) . Dwarves ? Again , Tolkien Brooks . Almost beat-for-beat . Coming age mankind ? Tolkien Brooks . God-like destroy old mentor personal relationship ? Sure , Star Wars , much similarly Eddings ' Belgariad ( note Phantom Menace couple years old Clone Wars released around time ) . Eragon farm boy orphan white mark hand marks magical powers ? So Garion , protagonist Belgariad . > ! Brom Eragon father ? Surprise ! Belgarath Garion great great grandfather come family guardian sorcerers chosen god protect serve ! ! < Seriously , clear rip-offs word white mark Eragon/Garion hands . ",1
11943,I honestly never understood anyone doesnt like ending . I loved really want eventually another story Eragons PTSD explored . ,1
11944,"I assure , every 12 year old boy I knew read book * awesome * . My friends got hooked runescape wanted like Eragon . The book spent 3 years NYT best seller list . It nothing author . ",1
11947,"I kid I read books thought bad . I knew plenty teenagers wrote fantasy , good prolific Paolini . But got published parents publishers . Not saying bad guy deserved anything honest criticism , I understand frustrated people see 15yo getting praise right place right time . It impressive write book . And young authors , takes years even lifetime get published . It like bad director gets film deal parents industry . If obviously dont put quality work , probably n't earn opportunity . As kid , I confused frustrated see book get published receive praise I realized happened . Then world made sense . I n't problem anyone reading Eragon enjoying , I qualms criticizing heavily . There plenty well written YA literature . And someone said , Shelley 18 wrote one greatest novels ever written . I n't problem keeping bar firmly place young people golden ticket . ",0
11949,Especially empathy bomb thing Eragon make Gabatorix kill . That super fucking clever despite heavily foreshadowed still comes surprise . I think people say story unoriginal n't finished series . Only first one super derivative . The last 3 pretty fucking unique . ,1
11951,I liked world wasnt fixed Galbatorix dethroned acknowledged real threat Eragon could crowned would n't really controversial anyone rulers . It made sense someone revered would need disappear allow rulers maintain authority . Galbatorix losing duel would absolute bullshit . It doesnt matter powerful Eragon . Galbatorix point god mortal . The relationship elf woman never made sense handled well enough separating . I pretending high art . But victorious yet ultimately sad ending exactly I want stories like . edit : Just remembered . The appearance Shuirkan ( I think dragons name ) genuinely shook . The description size mental state perfect story . ,1
11961,"Eh , I started reading series I 5th grade , really first big fantasy series , I always thankful . However , even teen I knew third last book deeply disappointing . The green dragon never mattered , last Drago Rider obvious choice , explanation Eragon leave ridiculous . If I remember correctly , argued new dragons would eat sheep therefor go ? This new book might come bit late , since I assume ’ much good left Lord Ring spin-off ending must people probably moved better fantasy . ",0
11964,"I reread first one months ago . I enjoy . I really liked I teenager I older way books belt , characters plot much nonsensical . The idea Eragon opinions things never encountered made sense . It almost felt like mary sue type character honest . ",0
11965,I glad I re-read entire series recently . It flaws Eragon majority childhood fantasy obsession . I certainly reading I curious see literarily developed Paolini affect storytelling/writing . ,1
11967,Oh yeah ! ! ! I finished listening books since I read high school I sad . So glad little story read . He also published sci-fi novel I downloaded pretty excited . It ’ supposed different style Eragon series though ready decide read . ,1

12002,"As kid I absolutely adored books , even I knew could get really , really clumsy points , especially characters make decision kind . Everything needed explained debated - alternatives needed thoroughly debunked could proceed . Let ’ take Murtagh Eragon ’ fight end second book example .

This back-and-forth goes upwards * 3 pages ! * It ’ almost like Paolini ’ trust , unless answer glaringly obvious get-go , reader ’ first instinct probably ’ pick apart character ’ decision-making process .

12004,"I enjoyed first book I kid ( I think given present ) , luckily unluckily I already read books Eragon cribbed world-building . There ’ almost * nothing * original Eragon series . He lifted dragon riding Anne McCaffrey , magic system Ursula LeGuin ( among others ) , mention general Tolkien trappings rehash Star Wars . Which ’ even bad ’ just… well written .

Shuriken hyped much literally useless lump . The magic system wordsmithing never really expanded upon used creative ways . Sure Eragon gets fire sword magical fire . No fire beams , learning spell words mix match creative attacks . Nothing . It felt hollow , built little shelved quietly .

She also duty dragon always wary used piece someone else ’ chessboard . And lastly , Eragon frankly lot growing . While storybook ending Eragon Arya would satisfying , especially series target audience time , I think way written much realistic , mature , true characters situations involved . ",1
12078,Idk magic system really something improved way Eragon . It probably one best magic systems fantasy literature ,1
12081,"I love em .

12085,"I loved magic based names , much like Wizard Earthsea similar works . Probably favorite type magic system . edit : I remember reading Le Guin big inspiration I think . You could definitely see young writer kind grew along books , I enjoy reading I . When I go back look Dragonlance .. yeah , always best writing , I enjoyed heck stories I teenager fueled love reading . Feel way Eragon basically . ",1
12087,"I admit Eragon bit derivative amateurish , I definitely feel like got better subsequent books . Brisingr Inheritance however , matured actually good read . It got pretty dark , without going full Game Thrones , repeatable . It ’ definitely LOTR , Brisingr one favourite fun read . If anything , Paolini knows pull big scenes together big payoff . ",1
12088,Highly recommend checking Ryan Cahill ’ work want “ Eragon adults ” ,1
12089,I ca n't get past Eragon super incel book 3 . Plus Paolini pulls deus ex machinas ass constantly . They 're okay books get deserved criticism . That said best book Eldest imo . ,0
12090,"These favorites kid . I read Eragon maybe 30+ times , copy taped together . I read Eldest maybe 12 times . By time Brisingr dropped , I kind aged , I read twice : initially , Inheritance dropped . That book I read , I remember one major plot point > ! vault souls ’ inside .

For example , Eldest , insisted Murtagh still alive predicted would bond red dragon cover . However , familial ties Eragon revealed , SHOT bed , slackjawed sputtering ! < I say Book 3 DRAGGING lot . A lot chapters feel unnecessary , like could ’ avoided better narrative choices . The books seem get slower-paced go . As far fantasy world derivative , I think ’ almost unavoidable . If read fantasy book , ’ either “ rips Lord Rings ” “ oh cool deviates Lord Rings. ” LOTR still axis . For , series like I get helping extra LOTR , I ’ grateful . Edited add : I make watch movie weeks back . She infuriated . But agreed Jeremy Irons best Brom . No excuses anyone else project . ",1
12092,"It always special place heart , absolutely solid Young Adult Fantasy series helped pave way harder stuff like LOTR I age 14-18 . Sure copies lot stuff Tolkien Star Wars , characters story solid , favourite part always Eragon connection Saphira . ",1
12093,"I loved kid I appreciate world building went . I liked descriptions training swordsmithing investment feeling progress . Also , I like Saphira . Her voice feels matronly , wise , yet experienced Eragon . ",1
12094,"I ’ always thought Paolini got unfair criticism . Eragon great , consider fifteen wrote . People love compare works written fully grown adults I think ’ shame totally unfair comparison . It ’ children ’ series written child half bad considering . ",1
12095,"I still love book series adult , Paolini mentioned something Eragon Arya romance like Aragon Arwin relationship , give us ending forever soured opinion final book ",0
12096,"The books fantastic reason I kept reading current 18 years life beyond I first read Eragon Eldest like 2005 . Without books , I ’ know I would ever picked book . Now I ’ hundreds ( probably like dozens dozens ) beyond I ’ amped new Murtagh book . ",1
12097,"I enjoyed reading , I felt bit let book 4 . I feel like set things books 1-3 could n't get shoehorn . But main thing I n't like > ! careful setup training Blödhgarm spellcasters help Eragon defeat Galbatorix showdown begins , Galbatorix immediately shunts playing field making irrelevant . I guess I preferred removal happen earlier highlight fact Eragon going David vs Goliath situation , rather leader army vs tyrant . ! < ",0
12099,"If enjoyed Eragon I recommend K J Taylor The Fallen Moon series . The first book called The Dark Griffin . It similar concept Griffins instead Dragons . The series adult darker , delving themes racism , slavery , religion . A big part religion , racism , societal expectations forge us people n't really want . ",1
12100,"As early teen loved , amazing considering written 20 ( ? ) year old guy , well tried re-read 20ties , neither harry fucking potter . One could much worse fantasy genre reading eragon . ",1
12101,"I started getting habit reading books late life I overwhelmed fantasy genre Eragon gateway sort Epic Fantasy genre world-building , creatures like elves , dwarves , dragons . I get seasoned reader would n't like accessible easy read gave confidence explore fantasy genre ",1
12102,"I n't care anyone says , I love Eragon I love Eragon dying day . I reread every year . Sometimes I listen audiobooks experience different format .

Yes , basic , I thought magic dragon rider concepts well built , particular second book great job explaining ancient order much greater mere mortals , also found way create dramatic tension . But Book 4 made number weird characterization choices undermined character development present parts narrative . It also made big bad invincible . It really struggled realize themes complete character arcs still completing well-written narrative . I wish Paolini bit mature writer . Eragon fantastic concept great core ideas . But n't implemented well . ",0
12105,"It ’ lovely series something really close heart .

Galbatorix around hundred years . He crushed riders century ago . His victory already came went , maintenance . Eragon , boy less two years training , n't going defeat game . I love climax way defeated follows running theme throughout books introducing riddles puzzles . The solution problem NEVER obvious one . Through four books greatest victories main characters achieve come force arms sheer power , problem solving ingenious thinking . ",0

Arya position among leaders high amount military economic ( magical ) power wields . Not Rider . 3 . Yes , Arya elves oversee first stages training Riders whose eggs hatch Alagaësia prior traveling Mount Arngor . 4 . You wait read Book 5 find one . Dragons : 1 . No comment . 2 . Humans/elves/dwarves even Urgals * * involved raising young wild dragons , since Saphira semi-grown dragon around n't Eldunarí . Human tribes : 1 . They came Alagaësia later . 2 . Any human could become Rider ( theory ) . War & politics : 1 . The dwarves going get huge amount reopening trade humans . The elves n't care expand territory much beyond Du Weldenvarden . These things explored greater detail later . 2 . No comment . 3 . Morzan actually held title lands Palancar Valley one point . When died , Galbatorix assumed control properties . Thus , Palancar Valley essentially owned state , one noble/earl . 4 . Huge impact . Again , something explored later works . Games : 1 . Hmm . I see getting rules posted website future . 2 . The merchandise situation tricky , Fox owns lot rights ( bought along movie ) . The Grey Ones messed whole bunch spells , poisoned land nearly destroyed society .

12504,Can ! Im part Orik tells Eragon tried assisnate Farthen Dur ,1
12505,I disagree spell . In mind Galby created powerful . He simply many dragons behind spirits . I n't think way defeat conventional mean I found spell kind ingenious . I bit disappointed spell cooked fly though . I thought despair scenes Eragon goes throughout book would given idea hurt Galby without actually physically hurting given wards would protect physical injuries . ,0
12512,"It ’ hot minute since I read series well , I think back Arya ’ character I ’ remember really conflict . External ones , sure ; lots fights . But internal ones , Eh . They brought one elves died protecting Saphira ’ egg kind like partner I think , mentioned upset gone . But never really showed signs grief . If I remember correctly , relationship mother supposed little bit strained , I ’ recall much bearing story . Her “ relationship ” Eragon felt one sided , never really showed much interest platonically . There ’ really anything shown wanting choose duty instead , old partner , able get age gap race differences . It Eragon texting “ ? ” And Arya leaving read lol . And throughout story never struggled much , never grew , never overcome anything . From I remember least . So ’ like ’ fantasy version manic pixie dream girl . I ’ read series see really , perception holds . But yeah I recall less character prop . ",0
12513,"I disagree . Paolini brings . Like n't references similarities , like brands stuff . And Liquid Suits , like , okay argument . Buts , inky black suit shoots tentacles alive . If ship minds , okay , , serious , male ship mind named Bishop . He could n't even name anything else ? Or make suit different color ? He habit . Look Eragon . Eragon huge mountain range ? No biggie . Lots fantasy stories big mountain ranges . He specifically calls The Spine . WoTs big mountain range ? The Spine The World . His fantasy series evil magicians 13 ? No problem , lots fantasy spooky bad guys 13 spooky bad number . But problem , specifically calls Forsworn . WoT ? 13 Forsaken . Like derivative , right plagiarism , buts legally safe brand cereal Acme . ",0
12514,Oh shit I talking Dune movie lmao yeah wow comparison apt . Eragon movie travesty ,0
12515,"I think perfect made fly , made sentiments . The way Sapphire makes spells look like miracles ca n't explain except I felt , , feeling brought dragons together , since lost minds , ca n't bring rational thoughts , still feel . Just needed right push , Eragon . Like first Eragon ended war empathy , ended war empathy . I could write whole text I love ending , psicological side seeing shadow exposed dramatic way , importance Eragon could magic way dragons , simbolic wordless spell , etc , etc . God , favorite series teens , read books release . The nostalgia hitting hard right ",1
12516,"The whole final fight gets weird definitely missed stuff . Like book 2 becomes big lesson steal living creatures energy spells Oromis tells eragon Galbatorix must never find . But huge villian spends 4 books magical research learns things elves dont even know remember , could come across ? ",0
12519,"> ! Yeah , Eragon casts Empathy Spell , causes Goratrix ( sp ? awhile since read ) feel pain people ever hurt , big G offs brief fight . I kind disbelief overarching villain 4 books defeated main character made * feel bad . * ! < ",0
12521,"I personally enjoyed lot got see one pov , suited well relationship call complex full uncertainty , kept reader sort dark Eragon . Also development training Du Weldenvarden well done , imho . ",1
12523,I excited read To Sleep Sea Stars . I loved Eragon books plan going back rereading perhaps daughters 're touch older . Thanks memories ! ,1
12524,"Definitely looking forward Murtagh . As much I enjoyed Eragon , I ’ curious see Christopher Paolini grown writer years . ",1
12525,"I ’ Eragon books . I know really young , effort definitely impressive , derivative . I ’ blaming ( 15 , I think ? ) I ’ read . ",0
12526,"I 34 , read Eragon tween/teen . I re-read last year wow . They n't bad books , WAY better anything I could write right ever . But books come , much cringe . The Eragon elf-girl non-romance . It began feel like Eragon incel . Even though could fuck literally non-elf consensually . The elves made powerful author magically make Eragon basically-an-elf existence make sense . The glaring issue series Galbatorix , insanely powerful conceivable world , magic anyone could possibly know , let everything happen . He nothing try stop Eragon , send another corrupt rider , almost worked . He like , Oh shit ! That rider almost killed Eragon 1/10000000000000 power ? I go kill real quick stay power . It isnt like sort Sauron deal bad guy tied Mount Doom/Mordor . Galbatorix fly around briefly . But ends like , What Superman power every facet life , kept sending Green Arrow fight enemies Again , books part growing loving fantasy . They always place heart , Chris great job writing series age . I interested Murtagh book coming , though I care character . ",0
12527,"I wish I able enjoy . When I finished first one I felt like I read A New Hope Middle-Earth . I know 're Hero journey , Eragon follows A New Hope beat beat alarming degree . Eldest bit better regard certainly still Empire Strikes Back . I also distinctly remember Eragon pretty insufferable book . One page would wise beyond years next would whiney little brat . When third book started main characters planning rescue mission I could n't anymore . I returned book library less hour I checked . Anyway , two cents . More power people enjoy . And despite feeling I still find impressive first book written writer young . ",0
12528,I found Eragon way better LOTR honest . LOTR could put assembly sleep real fast . ,1
12530,"The plot twist eragon dad really poorly done , imo . It almost interesting , twisted back obvious path . Also , read A Wizard Earthsea , seeing hard magic Eragon copies earthsea , kinda annoying . Especially since wizard earthsea deeper things say reader live life , eragon kinda Lotr : Return jedi . Eragon flying away distant lands end perfect example story kinda copying things . In LotR , frodo destroyed experience war , closed people , way find peace riding sunset , nameless lands never seen . He dies . Eragon thing , except I pretty sure supposed taken eragon finding peace death . He spreading dragon riding culture places , still around . It feels like copied ending lotr without thinking WHY frodo disappeared . ",0
12533,"I enjoyed I younger released . I reread adult found really lacking . I ’ put level childhood classics revisit , ’ pretty painful adult . The last book pretty lame , dragon soul thingy made sense terms Eragon ever hoping succeed killing king . Like power scaling insane , chance . Will wait see reviews murtaugh purchasing . ",0
12536,"I ca n't agree . The world building fantastic series , imagery vibes immaculate . Compare Harry Potter , HP world looks drab . Like potential insane JKR never explored anything fanfic writers done universe . I continue rereading Eragon series adulthood still good . It good goddamn story . I ca n't even say adult books . ",1
12537,"Sure , n't bad thing . His Inheritance Cycle stands much despite influences . It also impressive started Eragon age 15 . Immaturity shows sometimes earlier books sure , overall got impressive amount depth complex , multi-dimensional character work young author . Besides , little original fantasy n't borrow ( steal , put ) genre tropes previously established authors series . Even Tolkien stole whole lot influence Beowulf , Gilgamesh , Prose Edda folk mythologies . ",1
12540,"As I said , . There story elements series I thought super interesting . The scene Eragon tries uncover true name fascinating , example . ",1
12541,"Yeah books rough . Dude homeschooled I recall parents bankrolled book instead go normal publishing process reviewed , edited , revised , etc This shortcut , coupled youth inexperience resulted poorly written unoriginal story . Not , plot early story basically fantasy version ‘ A new hope ’ . Now I know stories follow plots another example ‘ hero ’ journey ’ . There nothing wrong reusing plot line . However , Eragon need raised Uncle rural farming community . His uncle ’ need die . He ’ need found local hermit happened one remaining practices fabled magic . He ’ need one next generation fabled magicians . His biological father ’ need one main antagonists magic users . The old guy ’ need die . He ’ need go find even older magician continue training . I sure I missing examples , get point . Like I ’ hate anyone reusing plot line , make ’ copy Star Wars . ",0
12542,"You 're one ! I soooo disappointed I tried reread Eragon last year . I managed get first book sheer determination fell flat . What happened suspense ? The adventure ? The thrill ? Thankfully , Hunger Games Harry Potter held years . As certain sparkling vampire n't speak name . ",0
12544,"As story Eragon fine . I like first one better second . The third one best . And fourth one n't wrap anything , fact leaves way questions . The annoying part whole series gets prophecies book 1 , nothing substantial comes really . Literally reason leaves never comes back prophecy said thats happens . Same getting Arya . I think series overall decent job setting Galbatorix . Although defeat dumb . They set powerful . So way heroes could actually win defeated . After 4 books set final confrontation like half page . And Galbatorix wins . Everything wanted Nasuada going . The empire new coat paint slapped people charge think justified beat bad guy get . ",0
12545,The later books better . Even eldest . But inheritance brisinger like 10x better eragon . ,1
12546,I loved everything Piers Anthony wrote I kid ooooh boy writing ( misogyny ) pretty cringe-worthy adult ! I read “ famous ” YA series adult ( I high school teacher many years wanted books everyone obsessed ) quite liked Hunger Games Harry Potter stuff . They hold fine . Actually re-read Hunger Games series maybe year two ago really enjoyed . Eragon though .... ooofffff I tried read book nephew LOVED first came . Barely slogged ( finished I wanted able chat ) . Not great writing say least ! Same Thing happened cousin told read Da Vinci Code loved much OH DEAR GOD book badddddd 😂😂 ,0
12548,Dude last book Eragon series made resent fact I read books honestly . ,0
12549,"I think problem act rereading . You read kid fascinated . And years raise expectations . And finally reread 're disappointed n't perfect book/world imagination . I read books never read actually think 're descent . Not especally good written , like evolution eragon . I think guys harsh ",0
12550,"You 're one ! I soooo disappointed I tried reread Eragon last year . I managed get first book sheer determination fell flat . What happened suspense ? The adventure ? The thrill ? Thankfully , Hunger Games Harry Potter held years . As certain sparkling vampire n't speak name . ",0
12553,"You definitely tell books edited sufficiently . It ’ big problem popular established authors editors stop saying , page count balloons . First Harry Potter barely 200 pages , every book 4 exceeded 600 . You see lot series like Percy Jackson , fast pace tight plot made special , move Magnus Chase never stop dithering . Eragon started lack reasonable editor , series got absurd . There reason Inheritance half long , considering ’ like handful battles Eragon disappearing find . I forgive series really basic hero ’ journey material , ’ part charm , certain point feels like author wasting time stroking ego 200,000 word slog . ",0
12555,"I re-reading Wheel Time . As good I remember . Loved Eragon kid , local author . But yeah , I really n't desire re-read . ",1
12556,I ’ read eragon twice ok times . Definitely rip every story ever chance grow . I ’ TRIED read eldest 3 4 times . I get bored page 30 every time ,0
12558,"Eragon obviously . The really jarring one re-reading Matthew Reilly . I used adore books school . Went back re-read Ice Station almost finished . Almost . I going finish spite , right point , near end book , aircraft entered scene . Ive spent much intervening time since first reading book , studying aircraft , air warfare . Suffice say average action movie realistic depiction air combat Reilly imagination generated . Id putting generic action prose nonsensical description special forces land warfare - wasnt great , also wasnt area expertise . The whole book really disappointing , Ive gone looking book spines fond recollection , embarrassed books place bookshelf . The saving grace least none people see bookshelf yet read Matthew Reilly .

12559,"I loved Eragon ! Always thought I go back reread , looking maybe I n't ruin . ",1
12560,I tried reading Eragon first time last year . I barely got 100 pages I gave . ,0
12561,"I tried rereading Eragon early last year I never finished kid , blown away god awful writing . Did n't even make halfway But last year I forcing read books I loved kid found many still held heart . The Great Brain , Valley Secrets , How I Paid College Percy Jackson series still totally ruled , even disconnect adult reading stuff meant kids . ( Though How I Paid College definitely little adult I remembered haha ) ",0
12562,"I think biggest issue Eragon prose simply terrible , least unrefined I nice . I tried re-reading last week . I hate say , I could n't even get thru first chapter . I exposed far superior writers since I originally went thru series , I guess maybe I bit spoiled higher quality writing . It really shame , I like story overall , Murtagh I thought I give go buy one . Too bad . I wonder would ever consider giving makeover higher quality edition experienced . ",0
12565,"I enjoyed Eragon , even though classic Hero Journey storyline , plot point plot point . Eldest , however , I wanted throw one across room . It obviously Mary Sue story Paolini Eragon everything fantasized himself- falling love feelings reciprocated much older , wiser , ( hot ) woman , saving day dragon , becoming sought-after advisor things war ripe old age 15 UGH . And page page PAGE made-up language translation . I also think NO WAY gotten published parents n't publishing field . I know kid wrote , I refuse read anything else guy writes . The self-importance ego oozed Eldest nauseated . ",0
12567,"You 're forgetting best one . At beginning book , elf woman pursued enemy uses magic send last dragon egg ( hope ) away remote location found Eragon . ",1
12572,"I continue love Eragon well . I wo n't defend writing quality , I honestly n't get getting much hate . ",1
12576,"I actually liked ending . Eragon turned bit asshole last two books , recognize become wholly incompatible society people knew much better trying push hamfisted mostly-happy ending . The final battle quite esoteric , though I got really angry main character several points story things sometimes needlessly cruel . But fact ( often sympathetic ) characters actually called chastised rather congratulating saved devolving Mary Sue - , well , lifted Mary Sue-like character first two books . ",1
12577,I loved series I younger seeing similarities Eragon took right . ,0
12578,"The thing plot Star Wars , way put together presented , changed world . Columbus ’ even first European discover Americas , changed world , gets credit . Avatar plot every Native American movie ever , way presented , special effects set apart . But look Eragon plot line see ’ add anything set apart let alone change world . The quality writing alone bad . Again nothing wrong using hero ’ plot line , way presented like copied Star Wars changes slightly . ",0
12579,"It change world small way introducing bunch young kids fantasy large books , well showing younger people write big things . I think part f reason DnD seen revival last half decade Eragon series . ",1
12581,So excited another Eragon production ! ! ,1
12582,"I actually super excited Paolini ! I hope Disney make story proud ! You skip I share story . I actually met Christipher Paolini comic-con signed collectors edition Eragon . He really one nicest people I ever met , I also asked plans release rest series similar binding . I immediately regretted unbeknownst seemed sore topic due fact ( I filling blanks bit ) seems like collectors edition made movie . It surprise collectors edition options dropped I feel like I made sad super brief exchange . Mr. Paolini ever see I sorry , I n't mean bring sore topic . However news makes incredibly happy I hope everything ever dreamed . You really wonderful author truly remarkable person . ",1
12583,"This interesting see . I loved books kid , I read I 10-13 . The eragon movie first taste true book screen adaption heart break . ",1
12587,"God , ? The books good novelty Paolini 15 . Good teenager , terrible tropey adult . Eragon - One letter away ‘ dragon ’ , book ’ dragons . Saphira - Two letters sapphire , dragon blue . Literally anyone could write . You want adapt dragon series , D+ ? Do Pit Dragon series Jane Yolen . ",0
12589,He improved immensely . Hell improved immensely entire series . Eragon Paolini would able think way corner wrote Inheritance . ,1
12594,Eragon leagues better Twilight . The movie hand ,1
12595,I ’ argue first book actually less original twilight . I identify Eragon ’ plot Star Wars Twilight cribbing whole genre rather single source I name . That could showing genre preferences though . I ’ read much twilight genre . ,0
12596,"Congratulations , came entire Eragon series entire detail . Like , think ’ smart , breaking stories level , acting like ’ ? I ‘ Romeo Juliet : Two horny teenagers rival families meet , want fuck bad , one pretends kill get pf family situation , heartbroken kills real . Other finds , . ",0
12599,Please n't compare thousands approximative fan fics expanded universe literally main books creator Eragon wrote How u call EU established story ? goddamn mess ! ,0
12600,"Nah bro . While theory works written Campbell The Hero With Thousand Faces , nothing Story theory says : Princess captured send hope young boy farm happens son traitor constantly watched Old Hermit secretly member order Emperor destroyed fought Farmer-Boy dad keeps colored sword . Nothing says : Old Hermit Farmer Boys go adventure meet dashing Jack trade together save princess . Or Old Hermit die . Or : The heroes followed Rebel base defend . Those plot points taken developed exact order Star Wars good story structure simple , fucking Star Wars . Hell , Harry Potter , Lord The Rings , Wheel Time , Dune , Princess Bride even fucking Game Thrones The Hero Journey theorized Campbell yet , Eragon Star Wars . And I talking first Novel . Let talk Farmer Boy fight relative end thing 1 000 stuff taken straight Star Wars . I saying bad thing , I said Star Wars fucking solid structure . But Paolini stayed close . Eragon n't Hero Journey Luke time . And even talking name straight coming Lord Of The Rings . Paolini parents published book IS impressive able write fucking entire book 15 , n't change fact went full Star Wars . ",0
12601,"That ’ pretty much . You ’ got . I ’ even sarcastic , ’ rough outline . The trick good way make way point A point B . Then fine outline . Then go flesh . Give imagery , paint picture . Make characters jump page . Make us feel like ’ . Give us chills imagining things character . In respect , Paolini fails well . By end book 2 , I ’ care less Eragon , cousin , Murtagh , Arya , . The best written character books Saphira , even beholden Eragon . Eragon subpar book , written kid , got hyper-inflated ego attention said book , coasted next books star power . ",0
12602,"It ’ pacing . It ’ basically everything , I ’ hit bulletpoints . It ’ long running joke , ’ quite joke , Paolini thesaurus taped hand . He loads books 10 dollar words like truncated splendiferous vague notions actually mean , turn makes stuff onerous read , especially ’ really saying anything . Books like Where The Red Fern Grows manages deliver maximum emotion without needing triple word score . And inexperienced write , neglected load pretentious word-of-the-days , left generic phrasing , continued . I ’ already mentioned stuff unoriginal , citing Star Wars LotR , ’ derivative , since knowing thing ’ true name order control magic straight EarthSea . The journey D & D game 1 cliche . The plotline ’ make sense sometimes , like Varden . Why fighting Galbatorix ? He ’ really interfering . He starts wars raises taxes , far I tell , ’ . And Durza powerful shows beginning book , need Urgal things ? The characters cardboard cutouts , never really feel emotional connection . The female characters cliches , ie , Arya stronger warrior , eventually weaker Eragon . Nasuada strong female leader eventually gets demoted Eragon . Female characters good stepping stone Eragon surpass . And ’ worse , Eragon little stupid . He believes everything everyone tells immediately . Then ’ plotholes . I ’ even feel like listing , I ’ sure GoodReads forum two subject . It ’ teenage boy ’ hormone-laced fantasy , aimed specifically hormonal teenage boys . And fame first book nothing turn Paolini could ’ great talent , precocious , arrogant little bastard treats fans everyone around like stewed crap . However , good alternatives A Song Of Ice Fire Martin , anything Tolkien , Shannara series Brooks , Pern series Anne Todd McCaffrey , Wild Magic books Pierce , Covenant series Donaldson , pretty much anything Feist , Kingkiller series Rothfuss , maybe Dresden Files Butcher like little noir comedy fantasy .

12608,"I n't hate edgy . I hate unlike barely readable books self published days ( good , get books , get practice , evolve . World needs story tellers . ) , Eragon * popular * . I would n't care book topic came , people went well , book . I n't hate . But instead people gushing novels , crying pain movie adaptation .

12609,What family thing ? Eragon n't son Vader ,0
12617,My biggest takeaway rereading Eragon series thirties much I grown . As around Eragons age written I remember relating quite bit journey . I thoroughly enjoyed seeing different I become seeing author grown person well . ,1
12619,"I read Eragon adult enjoyed . The writing n't spectacular , story well done writing get better series went . ",1
12620,"The thing remember many series introductory series authors , writing grow change author . I think Inheritance cycle Christopher Paolini ( Eragon , Eldest , Brisngr , Inheritance ) prime example . He started writing Eragon 15 , clearly shows writing . But stick series , see writing style improve , mature . The series grew along audience , ca n't witness get end fourth book . It important understand audience book trying impact , thinking age groups perspectives . One example series I point romance . In almost every single YA book , standard teenage romance attractions . In Eragon Eldest , seen Eragon Interactions Arya . But 3rd 4th books continue , begin see Eragon perception attraction begin change , Paolini writing style , mature understanding adult relationships , begins twist way relationship approached , interpreted afterwards .

I watched Coco cinema twice cried like little bitch times . That movie target audience 're kids . While sometimes certain gap , I find usually truly GREAT works art resonate also people 're outside target audience . My younger loved The Lord Rings The Witcher much I adore Pixar movies shounen manga . There also difference something taste something bad . n't enjoy Percy Jackson books , I appreciate 're well written fun despite trageted younger audience . On hand , books like Eragon Twilight 're clearly badly written stories products talented , inexperienced authors . And lastly , art bad still enjoy . Watching The Room cinema friends students one best cinematic experiences life . Hell , bad art also resonate completely unironically .

12638,"Thanks edit cuz absolutely saying . It true Eragon meant . I know difference book fine I target audience book honestly plain flawed . I disagree simply matter voting ; I happen think 're mistaken Avengers , people agree . Literary criticism actual thing . Yes , always element subjectivity art , n't mean objective metrics . I think possible break pretty clearly makes MCU objectively better narrative DCEU , n't box offices rotten tomato scores number downvotes . Lots people like Shakespeare ( least say ) plenty people think deep incredibly meaningful ; however actually dissect mostly pop culture persisted real long time . Clever word play , tons dick jokes , love stories n't hold even bit scrutiny . Just lot people believe works high art n't make true . They 're , good pop culture . ",0

Same Eragon end . But series blatantly bad . Hunger Games House Night series I point egregious . With Hunger Games solid first book , rehash themes , followed supposed closure series really n't need series treatment . Whereas House Night fun yet cliche premise . Vampires , Mary Sue , implied adult content . Then got point longer even fun trash blatant cash grab . There definitely difference target audiences fairness . If stay target may never know better .

I read * The Fault Our Stars * last year , age 30 , though I enjoyed , favorite character adult woman Lidewij , instead either teen protagonists . For grown-ups among us love ( ) YA maybe getting tired YA tropes , I recommend checking Alex Awards . They showcase books written adults would appeal young adults .

12671,I n't like Eragon I WAS target audience . I saw Star Wars connections early got annoyed . Everyone heaping praise Paolini like sort prodigy rewriting one popular stories ever dragons . ,0
12672,"Arguably , Eragon objectively bad . You read teenager , clearly book might get 6-year-olds excited . ",0
12674,"I YA target demographic I read Eragon . I hated . Not numbers fantasy , I love , Norrath remains one favorite fantasy worlds , blatantly plot ripped Star Wars , terrible prose , much whiney cringelord shit Eragon . The movie reconfirmed Hatred , Jeremy Irons far better Dungeons Dragons . It written exactly expect 15 year old parents publishing company would write book , 0 editorialization probably number rewrites . No author go first draft , I damned Paolini . Say might Drizzt Mary Sue edgelord , R.A. Salvatore infinitely better YA fantasy author , even fight scenes overly descriptive . ",0
12675,I ’ like Eragon even kid ,0
12679,Eragon alazing . My 11 year old mind felt stretched first true experience visualizing world written ,1
12683,"Honestly , adult I unironically enjoy plenty middle grade YA speculative fiction . A lot adult spec fic good . It often over-the-top edgy good reason , contains lot gratuitous scenes seem put make seem mature . Think unlikable characters sexist views , backstabbing n't seem fit character motivations , sex scenes n't seem fit rest narrative . Moreover , I read plenty adult novels ramble things could easily pared make story less tedious . I want spec fic fun escapism , overwrought , grimdark portrayal human weaknesses . As aside , I thought Eragon universally hated , every I come upon adult fans like book , seemingly idea hate base surrounding . For longest time I thought older audiences universally hated , apparently . Personally , I read better , I think Eragon fine . I like lot better Artemis Fowl . I n't like Artemis Fowl I twelve I n't like . It always felt bit artificial pandering . ",1
12684,"There certain series everyone , Harry Potter instance . I going 5th reread series still love pieces . I never read Divergent , Artemis Fowl , Eragon Twilight . Off top head YA books I read The Hunger Games series The Fault Our Stars John Green . Both I read adult much enjoyed . I mainly read nonfiction I read fiction usually meant adults ( like ASOIAF ) . To I say . If adult exclusively consumes YA material kinda weird least reading . The reader inevitebly get bored move something advanced . I read original Goosebumps series - 62 - I 12 13 , target audience 8 . ",1
12685,"Eragon bad writing though . But God bless , 14 still managed publish series poorly written bestsellers , worth care quality ? ",0
12687,Hell yeah ! Eragon best . ,1
12688,"Eragon great . I recently read first two books beloved child series , Redwall I suggested niece loved I wanted actually able talk without relying twenty-something year old memories . They 're really good n't expect complex discussion morality whatever realize 're reading children book even YA novel . I still suggest adults never read enjoyable easy read caveat . ",1
12689,"Huh I Eragon target audience , I * hated * obviously derivative classic sff I consuming time . I think rankled even years older nationally published author writing I basically considered ascended fanfic : / ",0
12690,"I sorry , I think Eragon genuinely bad book . There good YA books , I find prose Eragon horrible story derivative . ",0
12691,"Exactly . Like , Eragon YA book lore world building fantastic , writing n't great first couple books ( Hell , main plots Eragon Eldest basically A New Hope Empire Strikes Back high fantasy setting ) , fair Paolini 15 started writing Eragon . The books get better series progresses , still less stellar writing moments ( looking , scene Roran kills 193 soldiers literally standing 20-foot-tall pile corpses ) . ",1
12692,"Now I fair amount bias ( see : name ) Eragon one first series I really read I n't recognize lot stuff I find interesting I familiar popular YA fiction . Like fact Eragon comes bit whiny teen times hey , teen kind fits . And I think relationship Arya handled lot better lot romances series . He tries go girl likes , n't overreact instead handles fairly maturely , talk series progresses , n't take plot . And get together end bold move kind series . All , I sure better , nuanced books , I think lot stuff makes hold remarkably well . ",1
12693,"As someone loved series coming target audience , issues I even time . Ending big one , felt like major cop bad ending taint rest series ( I need proof GoT ) . > ! Galbatorix defeat extremely underwhelming made scratch head confusion , whole end Eragon leaving continent Arya stay behind Queen Elves felt like author abide prophecy created first book rather natural end book . ! < ",0
12695,I reread Artemis Fowl occasionally everytime I blown away home incredible writing . The writing Eragon shit I still enjoy immensely spite . ,0
12697,"I mean fair Eragon , Strip space laser swords Star Wars standard Heroes Journey Fantasy movie series . Simple Farm Boy finds special powers trained wise old mentor rescues mysterious princess accompanied rogue questionable morals points . At least original trilogy . ",0
12698,"I recently reread Eragon def agree . It still fun series really see much better got went along . Love series ! ( Yea , I kinda skim Roran bits . I came dragons damnit ! ) ",1
12700,"I think Eragon gets beat success Paolini young age , inspiration seen stories ( hero journey ? never heard ) , multitude reasons , saying writing bad strawman beat n't like . If n't like book think derivative , fine . Just say . Do n't yell book bad , author bad ! Ex : I love themes settings Cormac McCarthy , I listen analysis interpretations works , I ca n't read books . His writing style unreadable amount worldbuilding story elements make read . Does mean The Road bad book ? No , something I read . ",1
12701,"Bullshit . When someone brings Eragon people love comment much loved still love . There circle jerk . I commented numerous threads bring always get pushback 30-something fans refuse admit might flaws . I read book teenager age thought bad time . Could n't keep reading books ; became much . Horrible prose . Derivative narrative . Hell , one favorite YA series garbage prose , plot went laughably rails . You bet ass I still loved . But even kid , I knew bad . It okay read enjoy good books . But helps nobody pretend 're good . ",0
12703,"It similar hero journey trope , major plot points character roles almost exactly . Young man never knew parents raised remote farm uncle finds blue white object sought evil empire . Young man goes senior-aged acquaintance information told ancient order peacekeeping warriors mystical powers . The acquaintance one warriors , gives young man one weapons . Agents empire kill young man uncle , young man old mentor leave journey together . Mentor killed powerful agent empire , rebel princess rescued prison , young man joins rebels traveling companion n't still helps big battle . Young hero wins big battle well-placed attack . After battle , hero goes train surviving member warrior order hiding empire . Leaves training complete help friends , defeated emperor right hand man , given crippling injury , revealed 're family . Some events happen bit order roles played Star Wars characters split multiple Eragon characters . Luke told right away father Obi-wan Jedi , Eragon n't learn later . Durza Ra'zac play role emperor right hand first book , Murtagh takes role later adds family relation twist , even betrays emperor end series like Vader . I finished rereading series last week , enjoyable series one favorites , * lot * first two books reads like one Hey I copy homework ? Sure change n't notice memes . ",0
12706,"I n't think really fair dismiss issue people Eragon inspiration another hero journey book . There reason people call specifically Star Wars rewrite , example , LOTR rewrite , despite LOTR setting much similar . The plot points details New Hope Eragon close identical . ",0
12708,"Again , totally fine like Eragon ; lots cheesy bad books fun read totally cool . If want reread get foot door , I say go ! Always read * want * read . Forcing read something others think good never ends well . If like book , read . If n't like , put aside start new one ! If 're looking fantasy general something easily digestible , one first reading reccs general Discworld Terry Pratchett . It huge series , pretty easy dip . There several sub-series following recurring groups characters , n't necessarily need start beginning . I recommend * Small Gods * ( standalone ) , * Guards ! Guards ! * ( first City Watch sub-series ) , * Mort * ( sort halfway standalone start Dᴇᴀᴛʜ sub-series ) . The books mostly light-hearted , Terry Pratchett master making book satire allegory something else , also making fun read , books explore pretty deep themes . I grew reading never tire rereading . Pratchett made characters lovable enough like seeing old friend every time . [ Here reading order stick series . ] ( https : //i.imgur.com/VNnXF7Z.jpeg ) Another author easily accessible fantasy Brandon Sanderson . If like well built magic systems world-building , Brando Sando boy . His two main series * Mistborn * * The Stormlight Archive * , though bunch smaller series standalone stuff . The majority books part large interconnected universe , usually shown subtle Aha ! ways . * Mistborn * lighter fare two , borderline anime-esque action power scaling , quicker read . It two separate narrative sections ; starts trilogy books , separate trilogy ( another book way ! ) set later era world . The first half mostly Victorian era heavy 're saving world feel , era two basically goes full steampunk lower stakes . Book one Era 1 * Mistborn : The Final Empire * book one Era 2 * Mistborn : The Alloy Law * . * Stormlight Archive * four books far , narrative n't impenetrable anything , tone bit darker serious Mistborn . Each book around thousand pages , enjoy first one ( * The Way Kings * ) blow right . They 're fun detailed books , lots depth n't try complicated need . Brando Sando competent author , I rarely find bored anything writes . I also recommend two short stories jumping points ; * Shadows Silence Forests Hell * * Sixth Dusk * . Both nice bite sized squeezing interesting worlds . If want jump right deep fantasy , I really really loved * Liveship Traders * series Robin Hobb . It actually bit like Eragon , I guess , except sentient boats instead dragons . They wonderfully developed characters , coolest worldbuilding I ever read , least opinion . There decent amount life boats , politics , commerce stuff going , I never found bored . The first book * Ship Magic * . Kind wall pick * Spiderlight * Adrian Tchaikovsky . It essentially deconstruction quest/prophecy narrative . The main protagonist giant spider minion Dark , forcibly transmuted human compelled Light adventuring party guide quest . It unique book , bit tongue cheek , I enjoyed lot . If like sci-fi , also wrote another book I love called * Children Time * ! I kind terrible book reccs I tendency forget books unless I seen recently , I ca n't drum lists easy . But particular genres needs 're looking , I sure I others thread best help . ",1
12709,"It ’ tropes though , Eragon Luke ’ know fathers , live aunt uncle , aunt uncle die burn related deaths , masters die front . part two instead big reveal villain Eragon ’ father villain instead brother .

Secondly , I first fell love fantasy genre high school teacher told I check book I n't heard : The Hobbit . That 30 years ago , I never looked back . That said , I actually still enjoyed Eragon read entire series . Does robust world-building books like The Lord Rings pretty much anything Brian Sanderson ? No , still fun read . Sort like movies The Avengers Schindler List , n't always WANT read/watch something like ! So , love love n't ashamed . ",1

12734,"I read Eragon books college LOVED , I guess opinion wrong . ",1
12735,Why would bad ? I absolutely loved books . Maybe writing little poor IMO LOTR writing good . Maybe ADHD super hard pay attention LoTR crazy amount detail . Eragon easy enough read paying much attention understand plot . ,1
12736,"Eragon definitely classic fantasy tropes common several fantasy books . I imagine people set write epic fantasies end several elements common , unintentional . However , inheritance cycle one favorite fantasy series . I read lotr+Hobbit , game thrones , name wind series name , inheritance cycle certainly stands . If I remember correctly eragon alright setting things , get brisingr next books , story ramps quite bit becomes VERY interesting . Also n't listen people trying take away enjoyment . If like reading eragon , power , gets better : ) ",1
12739,Do n't let anyone tell fun wrong . I loved Eragon . ,1
12740,"The author Eragon claims books n't amazing - repeatedly asks people please keep mind young written . That said - yes , personally , I think lot stuff ripped . BUT n't mean actual plagiarism . The story still beloved many magic system , far I heard fans , pretty darn cool . I LOT friends adore Eragon . And even though I LotR-maniac , I blame noone ca n't manage read . Tolkien linguist first , author second , end day shows style . He tried create world realized ca n't create languages without culture lore . You enjoy whatever like , ask , long obviously problematic messages ( I talking romantisizing abuse , violence , racism shit like - none found Eragon . ) Also - Merlin bomb . ",1
12741,Eragon great book kid I n't understand tropes . I tried read adult seems little childish . That said I compare hobbit I see similar issues . The books Eragon Paolini really hit stride . The second book still little wonky teenage angsty handles really well gritty book series . Books 3 4 phenomenal writing imo . I read series multiple times fantastic series I adult ca n't read first one without constantly reassuring written 16 year old . Please keep reading I glad 're enjoying . I hope comments n't offensive anything . Its one favorite series ' I lot time think I like different books different reasons . ,1
12742,"As die-hard Tolkien fan , Eragon also one favorite fantasy series . The plot characters definitely bit contrived times , Eldest worst general opinion , third fourth books , I think Paolini really hits stride world . There lot in-depth exploration world many characters , view , feel like genuine people . When I finished Inheritance , I left hungry , desperately wanted see characters . In opinion , mark good book . As LotR , I read trilogy twice ; I 12 , time last summer . I started Fellowship many times gotten bogged I even got halfway . The first part long transition , go comfortable familiarity hobbits Shire wider , scarier world . Once get past Rivendell , things kick quickly . I found really enjoy get , right frame mind . I think Eragon good way whet appetite Lord Rings . ",1
12743,It ’ good awere flaws book reading . Every book issues ( Eragon ) ’ stop enjoying . ,1

12750,"> I really want LotR books , reason find first chapters tiresome . Eragon feels accessible . So bad I prefer latter ? Reading Eragorn unlikely cause harm , could enjoying process considered bad ? Most books n't Serious Business . Most books aim challenge biases assumptions . Most books sort deep inspection human condition might lead incrementally closer enlightenment . Lord Rings certainly n't . Lord Rings popcorn reading uncertain pacing wooden , formal style often putting modern readers . Reading Lord Rings n't inherently good reading Eragon might inherently bad . The bad reading happens book neither challenges , entertains . A bad book one wastes time . Eragorn n't wasting time ; therefore , Eragorn * good * book . ",1
12752,"No , bad . LoTR slog . If like Eragon like . Enjoy ! But I think apt comparison would Eragon Star Wars , least movie . ",1
12753,"The eragon books get better better . I huge bookworm , take opinion grain salt , fond memories eragon story . ",1
12756,"No bad . It favorite series . Yeah sure little derivative completely plagiarized . Just reused story beats books movies n't mean n't work hard creation . Dude researched lot old ( Norse I think ) come language system . Considering originally wrote 15 published 19 pretty good book . And keep reading see slowly comes writer gets less derivative series progresses . It really first 2 books borrow elements media . Edit : add comments LotR I personally find Eragon rest inheritance cycle infinitely accessible readers LotR . Yeah LotR classic progenitor genre holy shit good read someone starting high fantasy . Eragon excellent entry high fantasy . I personally credit making fan genre well first meatier novel I read . I wo n't lie , IDK I would reader person I today I n't read books . ",1

12770,"I love Eragon , first book . But I ’ admit I ’ never finished series . I ’ started re-reading times always stopped mid-way book 3 .... But Eragon magical book , despite amateur writing overdone tropes . My dream book would dragon rider book like Eragon better . People say ’ LotR ripoff never watched bad Eragon movie , regretted , started rereading book instead , chance next day , watched Star Wars : A New Hope . Eragon Star Wars , dragons instead droids magic instead Force . There much Star Wars LotR Eragon . ",1

12792,"One personal favorites I would say better Eragon ( terms writing least ) Ranger ’ Apprentice . It ’ got dry sarcastic humor , swords , bows , horses , bit magic , romance , ’ overall pretty well-liked far I know . I think ’ bit sophisticated Eragon , I ’ think ’ unapproachable definitely middle-young adult age range ( although I re-reading 23 I love ) . I say someone read LOTR way , Ranger ’ Apprentice definitely easier read . ",1
12793,I enjoyed Eragon I also really enjoyed The sword truth series Terry Goodkind . Check one maybe . ,1
12794,"Actually may enjoy * The Once Future King * series . The books start * The Sword Stone * ( source Disney adaptation ) made young readers mind series kinda grows reader culminating The Book Merlyn ( Yes , spell like ) kinda like Symposium takes place night Strife Camlann . In matter * Lord Rings * find understandable maybe try hobbit first lighter read . Also general matter Is bad like something I would say . You like whatever like I find interesting searching I like something . Eragon could seen bad people maybe find derivative fantasy tropes n't nothing wrong book . Understanding flaws something good ( book perfect ) still enjoy afterwards . ",1

I ca n't even really put finger I hate reading loved reading something like Eragon . Similarly , I HATE lima beans . I n't know I hate lima beans , I simply think despicable food known man . I love arugula brussels sprouts husband feels poisonous crap suited trash . I guess point I making great works , suffer occasionally tell something important .

Now I understand Hero Journey n't anything new Star Wars n't original thing either , similarities insane . Fast forward later I gave Eldest shot .

Learning cool new Elf lore , lets take bit break look Roran , fuck . I really n't like handled problems introduced . The biggest offender final battle big bad dude . Guy built unbelievably strong . Utterly unkillable realistically . Oh fine heroes find weapon right start 4th book bypasses magic wards . Wow lucky . So solved problem right , pretty shit way solve w/e . But THEN makes bad guy even stronger weapon useless generate another cop , except weapon would least given epic battle end second cop kills bad guy making feel bad . It like tried like Palps dies ROTJ falls flat face . Similarly back problems . It gets magiked away near end book 2 reasons . It like even grows character , right gets back fixed goes breaks arm one sparring partners . Our hero ladies gentlemen . The lore world building great though . A lot cool interesting things never covered could done books . I always wondered , since ca n't lie Ancient language , happens say paradox . ",0

If come 10-15 years sooner market less saturated , might relevant , time came ( importantly , time wrapped ) , enough good YA fantasy n't really much reason exist . I say : look books meta perspective , practically see Paolini growing , especially Eragon obvious self-insert protagonist . The first book reads like written kid- basic plot , derivative setting , absolute black-and-white morality , main character acts almost exclusively service plot , generally little thought reason . The second book feels like written college student . Eragon starts introspective much angst-ridden , becomes fairly militant vegetarian atheist ( traits commonly associated obnoxious college students ) seemingly nowhere . By time later books rolled around , everything leveled somewhat- story became less morally absolute , main character started acting like adult reigned overbearing stereotypical-college-student values , story became less predictable/generic .

I n't think amazing , I like defeated Galbatorix unexpected creative way . Heck , nothing way ended way I expected , kudos Paolini defying expectations way still logical .

They n't unfair criticisms . Paolini acknowledged weaknesses interviews , even time . The plot also really predictable . But people like n't somehow reading fake fantasy .

12964,"I recently reread Inheritance Cycle several months ago , read book since released . I knew going books would n't hold well I remember . Even I n't biggest fan Brisingr Inheritance released . With reread , I think lot criticism thrown series lot merit behind . There merit discussing n't work . I also n't think Paolini deserves hate bashing simply publishing fiction . It n't fault got popular . There really nothing offensive series . To honest , I n't think argue opinion well enough write-up . I take Deus Ex Machina section one example . No argue n't considered one beyond plays certain theme , I think n't . Eragon getting back healed dragons definitely Deus Ex Machina . It come nowhere foreshadowing . That something debate . It destroys potential moving forward Eragon n't deal . Proactively make Eragon journey dealing injury pointless . It also n't strengthen whole idea series dealing scars . It opposite , removes scar contrived way . I never thought heard empathy spell called Deus Ex Machina , kind come nowhere . I found whole section disappointing entirely different reasons . I glad enjoy series holds special place heart . Nobody criticizes books trying take away . Those people want discuss book n't work . ",0

( I ca n't say different popular series owls annoyed point I actually quit reading . ) I thought Eragon good story , even inspirations pretty obvious . It still fun story dragons inspired lot people . And I people reading anything want reading book better reading book ! ",1

I think I read Eragon late elementary school year came , Eldest soon released seemed like I waiting forever . By time Inheritance came I really old ( I think 17-18 ) reading series first time read much mature fantasy ending n't impactful . I think lot people around age share sentiment . I n't gone back read I n't especially inspired .

Eragon n't develop PTSD fight Durza . I remember Eragon creating poem gift elaborate capstone emotional arc . > For empathy spell , I think properly foreshadowed Shapira memory Brom , tells Eragon defeating king wo n't matter raw power , seeing weakness Galbatorix could never think . Their initial plan defeat use Elga power precisely use empathy , opposite direction . I n't problem idea empathy spell , everything leading leaves moment makes anti-climatic boring . Eragon never engages real series antagonist kind meaningful way struggle . I n't think Paolini used piece set-up wrote Eragon defeating Galbatorix manner . Also , foreshadowing sense . A key component Brom advice order Eragon find weakness , understand opponent thought , view world , etc . When Eragon fires spell , n't come place understanding anything Galbatorix . It n't written like Ah hah , I figured something moment I worded spell way bypass ward . The way Eragon begins idea spell isnt ' suddenly understands Galbatorix lacks empathy . ",1

His prequel , A Restoration Of Faith , ’ compelling , character little girl ’ believable . Storm Front much better , still getting stride . Fool Moon even better Storm Front , I liked really put definition Karrin Murphy . And consistently got better every book . My point , bad Restoration , ’ terrible , ’ Butcher top game . Paolini confined ripping tropes flaunting weak vocabulary , insistent somewhere drivel , ’ bestseller . And nothing points particular fact although Butcher Paolini NYT Bestseller authors , Jim Butcher three Hugos Locus , well three Dragons Paolini ’ single nomination German award , lost , well NYT Bestseller List hardly objective easily manipulated . Just look ‘ Triggered ’ ‘ Real Marriage ’ made onto list . Is Paolini worst writer I ’ ever read ? Not hardly . Does seem willing accept criticism , constructive otherwise ? Nope . Every subsequent book Eragon follows tropes gaping plot holes , showing despite consistent outcries usage stale plot , considered devising shred originality .

13043,Gah one things I liked least later books trying split viewpoints . Nothing else compelling Eragons story ,0
13044,I think Eragon probably worn book . I first copy ’ terrible condition must ’ read least 50 times took everywhere . Last heard ’ another book works beyond saga ? Could wrong though . ,1

13053,"I enjoyed . I really loved Eragon I first read Jr. High ; I come see flaws books * , I n't think 're bad books . I read entire series start-to-finish summer ( reading 4th book first time , rereading rest ) , still enjoyed reading . Some flaws books writing unpolished , tend get caught terribly engaging political bits , bits seems like author trying hard put opinions book , characters tend relatively one-dimensional . But favor : excellent setting interesting magic system ; plot engaging earth-shatteringly original ; really good moments . If n't mind books n't perfect , I think good time books . If get easily distracted flaws books , I might recommend give pass . * Side-note flaws ; notice I n't list It rip Star Wars list . It I n't really find legitimate complaint . Yes ; ton similarities plot Star Wars series ( particularly book 1 ) , 1 ) n't help Star Wars fairly generic plot ; basically textbook hero journey . Notice Star Wars somewhat generic n't stop really awesome film series . 2 ) Even given book least inspired Star Wars , n't immediately make bad book . Is n't Star Wars , told fantasy book dragons something interesting premise ? ",1
13054,"Personally - I enjoyed . However , much story Eragon story Paolini Eragon came breathing , living book . Really - one rewarding stories family support kid putting . The Book pretty formulaic predictable - grafting numerous well played tropes . The best explanation - Star Wars meets Lord Rings . However - really - knowing history book came , reading story view 17 YO bringing creation - I enjoyed . It allowed easy forgiveness predictability less stellar writing . So - I guess TL/DL Is Good ? - Yea , amount heart MADE good ",1
13057,"I recommend Movie Maintenance podcast Sanspants Radio episode Eragon ( I know says movies also talk fixing book ) I n't even like Eragon much , good job addressing shortcomings series . I think give listen ",1

Having nostalgia middle school finally concluding journey college felt like I completing journey Eragon . I hope reread day . ",1
13061,"I also like point many characters Eragon series make excellent role models young adult target audience . For elementary/middle school girl reading books , I ca n't even say much I idolized Arya . She truly strong independent female character , took life hands made fortune . She born wealth royalty , denounced pursued interests rather succumb pressures familial expectations , accepting felt ready assume elven throne . I also loved Eragon love Arya remained unrequited , n't destroy relationship . Too many young adult novels resistant women worn male pursuers affections , incredibly unhealthy worldview teach young people . It refreshing see female character simply said unwanted attention , see Eragon character come accept value friendship . This one main reasons I love series : characters real , n't perfect . Eragon immature , irrational , n't think acts . Arya proud wo n't accept help needs . These real personal problems people relate read books , characters like deal problems healthy ways help readers !

13062,"Read Mistborn , The Name Wind , The Way Kings . The worldbuilding done Eragon laughable compared Sanderson , Rothfuss , Abercrombie , Lynch It best world building . It impressive new young author . He deserves praise . In decade might really good . ",0
13063,"Are n't stories collections recycled bits stories though ? At point history nearly impossible truly original , matters author takes certain story elements , ideas , character bases etc . interprets !

My definite favorite YA fantasy novels , one guaranteed make cry end ; ) ",0

Good making money ever going good matter many fans . , Paolini , wants write stuff set world start new story , great . Eragon basically LOTR fan fiction run amok personally dont want see . ",0
13078,"Yes . If take book face value , Eragon basically motive killing Galbatorix . His goal start kill Ra'zac . That . Unless extremely weak-willed individual ( n't , judging submitting Galbatorix multiple occasions ) , true reason wage war Galbatorix . That elf war Galbatorix ; Eragon reason . I sure Galbatorix sent Ra'zac destroy Carvahall , I remember Eragon hearing officially joined Varden . There really 2 plausible reasons joined Varden first place : 1 ) . Longstanding relationship Brom . I n't remember Brom telling join Varden , though . I remembered telling Eragon go learn Dragon Riders . 2 ) . Him hating taxes . It really thing know Eragon motives , . The book n't really explain motives , wanting kill Ra'zac get revenge killing Brom . It also pretty obvious dislike Nasuada policies , left . He probably knew crippling country magical defense good politics war ( even trade agreements ) . Of course , Eragon might complete pushover I might completely wrong . ",0

What great experience , well wife I . If read children learn see chore . When old enough , almost essential listen raptly start reading back .

The pace n't breakneck speed good allowed figure hell going . I type ADHD I focus everything time . I could n't never get The Hobbit kid pretty overstimulating . Something LOTR cooler .

13308,"The Hobbit favorite book I ’ put either , first time I read . Welcome Middle Earth . There much , ’ ready ",1
13311,"The personal difference movies books books spend time different things movies . The Hobbit LOTR movies spent lot time building massive battles , battles book merely mentioned single paragraph . Some could argue , good way , movies made storyline consistent throughout less downtime drama important events , cutting changing useless plot lines added ( specifically end LOTR books ) . I wouldent suggest movie hater book hater like subjects , good way , movies action packed , drama filled , straightforward , books spent lot time smaller plot lines events explained much deeply . Personal preference would movies LOTR/Hobbit , ’ mine ",1
13312,Same ! I brought copy read I finished book still going chapters rest class . I told I heard The Lord Rings could I bring start read remained The Hobbit class said ‘ YES ! ! ! ’ This mid nineties . ,1
13313,"Huh , 5th grade teacher also read us whenever free time ! I credit love Tolkien day . I convinced Dad buy boxed set LOTR , hard 5th grade , I stuck years later read Hobbit Lord Rings around 20 times . ",1
13316,"I odd one say better choices class novels . I adore Tolkien stuff The Hobbit probably loved children book I read class 9-10 year olds last year , although enjoyed parts , quite slow , dry sections book . Most language fine words dated hard kids connect . We ended getting 50 pages end putting something paced quicker . This n't say bad choice classes , two cents . ",0
13317,Our teacher also read Hobbit us chapter day . Our class nine year olds enthralled . However deliberately never finished . When got exciting bit end put book class library told us read rest . Unfortunately one copy book 30 students classs . Life happened I never managed get hands . I never forgot though I finally got copy twenty five years later . Read cover cover went straight LoTR . ,1
13318,"Through series extenuating circumstances I read The Hobbit 2 year old Daughter every night bed . I n't high expectations would follow story - sound voice would comforting . However , number complete readings became apparent followed - grown love - story . Since enjoyed The Hobbit perhaps would also enjoy LotR , case . I speculate The Hobbit linear , comparitively , faster paced The Lord Rings - vocabulary much different two . I struggled find novels appeal , e.g . Harry Potter , avail . I wonder breaks formula The Hobbit : Linear , A B , flashbacks , forwards parallel narratives . ",1
13320,"Not , LoTR much darker The Hobbit . I read three first time last Spring . I surprised dark actually creepy could times The movies really portray . The journey Moria downright spooky . & # x200B ; Will reading , much details I sure I missed lot . But enjoyable . Take time try rush sake completion . There lot books unfold . ",1
13322,"Yours may unpopular opinion . For , hobbit fun lotr epic . ",1
13323,"I like much . The perception bit tainted movies I make comparison LotR still . Oh , I really like much characterization Bilbo getting Hobbit . Tolkien soldier fought one horrific battles WW1 writing something like T * dreadful Bilbo ’ experiences , one time hated most—which say one proud , fond recalling long afterwards , although quite unimportant * really interesting reminds stories I heard WW veterans .

13324,"The hobbit fun modern bard ’ work easiest read , old skald best LotR , I count one book . Simmarilion example arguably much world building ",1
13326,"If I recall correctly , originally bed time story told son Christopher eventually wrote . The Hobbit came first release The Lord Rings , went back made changes make consistent LotR ( mostly dealing one ring ) . ",1
13328,"Extended makes better , also adds top stuff well , improves upon film theatrical release overall feels less clanky ( theatrical cuts lot fluff feelgood stuff books , explains bit lore uninterested reading books delving silmarillion ) By means subjective , I would say watch lord rings trilogy hobbit ( go extended ) . Though opinion , I love bunch ( family would say much , surpassing love star wars ) , I grew LOTR film trilogy , read hobbit unexpected journey got extendeds six . Trying get copies books . The score first LOTR probably favourite score time , two similar category . Total run time insane theatrical extended watch entire thing . ",1
13331,"It definitely holds hand fair bit , lest forget , hobbit children book tolkien originally told son bed journey includes brief histories told dwarves , wizards , incidents goblins large underground city dragon . A LOT happens around 356 pages . I fairly certain first foray middle-earth , hand holding also expected degree , Tolkien stickler details . It also easy go go deep explaining things , go create fictional universe , complete languages litany backstories explaining origin world stories predate events hobbit several thousand years . Still great book . ",1
13332,"It interesting point Tolkien n't writing Hobbit part big mythology . It magical tale funny , humble hero . The reason leaving simply could n't wizard problems . So really point Gandalf could trickster/meddler benevolent guide . ",1

13360,"I finished reading second time , read first time 8th grade . I ’ 29 . I ’ agree ! I disappointed Thorin end stubborn gold , ridiculous ! I suppose , end , book called Hobbit , rightly . Bilbo true hero story . Even though Bilbo ’ kill dragon , identified weak spot ultimately killed . Great writing go around I listened audiobook , fantastic quite fun hear Gollum different songs sung throughout novel . ",1
13361,"You watch cartoon movie The Hobbit . Closer book opinion , dwarves 100 % lazy cowardly . ",0
13362,"I think especially Hobbit , parties come away pretty flawed . * The dwarves pretty greedy , selfish bunch primarily concerned recapturing former glory , * elves ( Thranduil bunch ) collossaly arrogant spiteful , show fight take piece pie , * Men ( lake ) primarily concerned politics stay rich power * Hobbits bunch bumbling narrow-minded country bumpkins The whole story essentially couple exceptional ( untypical ) individuals ( Brand , Bilbo , Barin , Elrond , Gandalf ) stepping past shadow make things happen , forced . And even , plenty warts issues . All-in-all , fairly multi-dimensional story , looks first like pretty straight forward good vs. evil 2-dimensional setting .. That genius whole thing . ",1
13364,"I read Hobbit LotR teen boy I prepared read children book . I disappointed I reached final third glimpsed little bit LotR heroism Battle Five Armies . As consequence , I always liked movie version - shortcomings - I expecting back still true silliness humor book . And yes , dwarves bunch miserable old men , whining lost gold . It would obvious child maybe , adult , funny right I appreciate whole Hobbit : Bilbo hero journey . ",1
13365,I finished Hobbit first time last month I . About 100 deep LOTR . The Dwarves inability share anything end pretty pissed . ,0
13367,"The Hobbit long fairy tale caricatures typical . The character fleshed Bilbo , necessary story told Bilbo perspective . ",1
13371,"huh . one hand 're right , : children book written entertain Tolkien children . If dwarves would able slay dragon would storyline beginning . yes , Thorin dwarves make living warriors rather kind salesmen . everyone bit clumsy incompetent make story line work . In opinion feel adult parts get story - one ring Gollum fate , Beorn powers course , Bilbo act betraying Thorin good , Gandalf disappear sometime soon noone could think slaying dragon solving problem . also : I guess Lake-town burn Bard glorious hero , also broken man lost . never intention Tolkien contribute big heroic stuff even smallest people make difference storyline . fun thing turns around Lord Rings : everyone best hobbits clumsy people . rest : warriors , sometimes professional trained killing machines ( remember one first scenes movie ? long lines Elvish soldiers precise movements , killing second getting killed ) ",0
13373,"Well , Tolkien understood everyone story wise good , among reasons , makes people really want highlight wise good appear ordinary comparison . In The Hobbit , Gandalf Elrond unambiguously virtuous heroes ( add Aragorn Faramir LoTR ) , rather selfish dimwitted dwarves serve contrast . Finally , importantly , Bilbo ca n't portrayed reluctant Hero dwarves competent , bold , decisive . Then really would tag-along burglar , real importance story , means rise dwarves ' esteem . It reason government either incompetent corrupt action movies . If FBI Die Hard competent , need John McClane go rampage save everyone . If Lestrade good detective , Sherlock Holmes snarky drug addict . Also , I sure I describe dwarves bellends , 're normal . People acting self-interest , avoiding risks completely rational , mostly people behave real world . Thorin particular case gold-madness arguably worst deeds , device used dramatize approach final battle , well hammer home one Hobbit moral themes . ",1
13374,"When I kid I saw cartoon movie first portrayed dwarves even cowardly greedy , I sort opposite experience I finally read Hobbit . The dwarves actually competent fighters book . They could beaten trolls n't foolishly tried fight batches two dwarves vs three trolls .

So Lake-men seize treasure ! ) In film , Smaug pushed right buttons bringing Arkenstone , big deal Bilbo friends one many problems book films fixed expanding upon .

The high king Turgon dies battle nameless enemy , Glorfindel ( returns LoTR ) dies takes balrog attacking refugees . Tuor ( ancestor Elrond ) defeats Maeglin dark elf betrayer . The swords Orcrist Glamdring ( would go Thorin Gandalf Hobbit ) gain fame . Compare contemporaries writing Great War , Wilfrid Owens Siegfried Sassoon , even modern writers Sebastian Faulks * Birdsong - * much greater emphasis rank file . Indeed upper officer class often ignored vilified uncaring ignorant . There often visible enemy , rain artillery , chemical weapons snipers keeps everyone state terror shock . The soldiers simply march doom , great detail spent describing wounds psychological impact surrounded death . It epic heroes gloriously sacrificing .

We get Hobbits Hobbit-y , singing walk , getting swept silly wonderful Elves give feast woods vanish morning little trace .

A gender-switch n't make Hobbit one bit better , also n't make worse . It completely irrelevant original story course n't matter change . ",1
14882,"A better read ? Really ? Sure makes different read , Tolkien wrote . Simply changing character head female n't make better . In fact , thing changes pronouns . If Tolkien wanted Bilbo female , would big deal . As seen rest universe , adventuring female character big deal . Eowyn ( slew witch king ) deal disapproval , disguise , DID overcome everybody prejudice . By changing Bilbo female character , thus , making gender non-issue consistent values Middle-Earth , 1930 England ( The Hobbit published ) . TL ; DR - Having Bilbo female inconsistent Middle Earth value system . Gender IS issue world . ",0

It good book ! Tolkien wrote really well . I comment . However , I like point books/stories/media sort encourage young boys explore express feelings . Young boys n't many great role models expressing emotions . There definitely books stories , minority . So often , men portrayed fearless , emotionless stumps . Never crying , never singing , never laughing , never afraid . The hero often worst role model young boy . Having character Bilbo , expresses full range emotions , extremely beneficial young boys . It teaches okay expressive rounded . Is role model also beneficial women ? Absolutely ! But women n't typically suffer * often * emotional stunting men . This comment post women vs men whatever . I think however link makes good point Bilbo good role model girls gender-switched , ever better role model boys . Especially age boys encouraged hide feelings , show . ",1

14900,"Tolkien hardly managed female characters well , even * LoTR * . It odd covers much detail daily life , even details seem unnecessary- yet women strangely unmentioned . Far less mention women * The Hobbit * . But characters lacking love interests family relations DO make easier swap genders outright . ",0
14903,"I get 're saying , I n't think point particular article . This author seems saying women media underrepresented , sometimes represented , way makes femaleness big deal . Like , look girl amazing thing * girl * wow . An example might Tauriel character added Hobbit movie . She ca n't captain guard feels sorry dwarves person reasons , fall love girls ! So basically , making Bilbo female means gets real person without crap usually goes ( poorly-written ) female characters .

Which bad author could nice little article developed idea parents modifying stories children WHY modern authors seem suffer inability write female characters whose gender n't one defining characteristics .

15098,"The world around authors time reflected work , whether folks like admit . Authors works ’ exist vacuum , thread alone people already drawn comparisons tales glory valor experiences WWI .

In 1954 , LoTR first published , women entering public sphere . It nearly two decades The Hobbit ’ original publish date , perhaps Tolkien ’ life experience could explain slightly inclusive handling female characters , complex world building general .

15105,"These ideas much coherent well thought comments . As normal trite opinions subject - I misjudged commitment books . But worth saying - idea novel unique n't mean valid holds scrutiny . Just , opinion commonly held n't mean worthless . Sure I repeating ideas theses professors scholars I read , like I got grad focus Epic literature . Irish Lit focus . So I tourist Tolkien Epic literature . That said , I talk somewhat intelligently subject - gon na long response , bear . So anyway , lets start Homer , cause probably I know best - There timeline issues statement Homer obsessed Persian empire . The 1st Persian Empire came power around 550BC ended 350BC . Now idea The Odyssey written , generally assume written Homer around 750BC - Homer using oral tradition basis writing . So oral Bards recited The Odyssey Homer time anxieties foreign , Middle Eastern powers , n't Persians . Before The Achaemenid Empire , Persian people nomadic , united , certainly threat power Greece . The Assyrians Anatolians mentioned Homer writing , Phoneticians Egyptians written extensively The Odyssey Iliad . Maybe anxiety foreign Middle Eastern powers ( could probably make fantastic argument ) , certainly n't Egyptians Phoneticians . Homer writes trading habits , exports imports , gods religious pantheon . Zeus tells Odysseus see King Phoneticians - treat well travels home . Now Greeks held many prejudices I think assume held favorable views least Phoneticians Egyptians . Their wares religious culture military strategy vessels spoken highly . I feel like , oral poem , praising skills shared enemy would n't impress audience much . The East certainly foreign , other-ness quality used throughout Western Civilization , example , I think Tolkien utilizing specific language Homer Epic writers interest tradition . I think Tolkien , way describing group people - people , location . The Huns 'of The East ' Nibelungenlied , Hyperboreans dwelt Northern Wind The Odyssey , Egil Saga Volsung Saga refer groups people directionality . It theme , Tolkien utilizing narrative - opinion . You could possibly convince otherwise . Onto Tolkien inclusion women LotR lack women The Hobbit - He certainly chose source material - women major aspect traditional epic literature . Sure , Odyssey , women clever intelligent , often equal husbands ( Penelope Calypso Charbydis reckoning forces , literally ) even , The Odyssey 1 female every 10 males ( Penelope Suitors , understatement ) hardly women The Iliad . Helen described bewitched whore - . And nice look . She given significantly depth appearance The Odyssey , otherwise , women traditional Greek literature plot mechanisms foils . So Tolkien source material diverse coalition female characters , works almost none . Beowulf , Nibelungenlied , Hildebranslied , Germanic/Icelandic epics sorely lacking female characters . But Shanemah diverse coalition warrior women - text I think inspired number female characters LotR . Excluding The Hobbit , OP pointed , women , LotR Silmarilian fact diverse cast strong female characters . There Sam wife , Valar almost equally divided men women , Lady Haleth , Galadrial , Shelob female , Arwen slouch others . There may many women Tolkien stories , women includes strong , formidable , wise , often times dangerous . I ca n't think single feeble , weak willed woman entire trilogy I name probably half dozen sniveling , unmanly , subjugated men . I agree final point - artists separate art . John Lennon terrible father , Albert Einstein womanizing shithead , Cobain debilitated dope addict . I n't think fair label Tolkien writing 'racist ' 'misogynistic ' . There enough evidence writing suggest true , evidence support personal life . I ca n't tell much personal life , even racial prejudices , I n't think LotR interpreted way described . The women include inspiring , racial themes aligned traditional epic narrative language 20th century prejudice racism . But , ya know . It worth considering . I enjoyed argument much . ",1
15107,"I currently reading The Hobbit daughter . It first time I read since I kid . The thing I struck much feels like Tolkien telling tale conversation . Perhaps n't connecting straight ahead read , maybe try reading aloud like performance . Or try audiobook . I usually n't go audiobooks unless style fits performer good . Someone mentioned Andy Serkis one sounds like would quite good . ",1
15108,"The Hobbit pretty short . The first 49 pages seems long Unexpected party slooooooowwwwww , next 238 ( yes , I remember exactly many pages childhood copy long time ) much action packed . ",1

AVOID THOSE UNTIL YOU VE FINISHED THE BOOK ) They 100 % accurate books good job catching feel books . Also , leave lot , books still feel fresh ways . It help know exciting stuff coming get bogged rather slow beginning Fellowship Rings . I personally think totally fine skip prose descriptions ( poetry ) first read . I love Tolkien world building , I read books times I count appreciate beautiful writing , I know drive get action . If keep going - ! You always come back read enjoy later . * * TL ; DR * * If like prose n't lot time r/lotr slow read jam . If get bored prose watch movies skim slow bits , always re-read I love hear progress !

15113,"I agree completely . For Tolkien world , culture , language history important character plot . It letting reader know stake , effect events story world past shaped future . Sometimes means story slows crawl think like stroll forest enjoy scenery Tolkien describes . If try fight pacing probably end hating books . They action stories .

15121,"To , makes The Hobbit unique worth reading . Bilbo n't become Dragon Slayer , n't great War Hero , happens guy along ride wrote book travels .

15123,"I would recommend reading Tolkien Essay Titled - On Fairy Stories . He refers Dues Ex Machina-like things eucatastrophe core part fantasy story . Tolkien uses eucatastrophe stories like eagles return king , killing Smaug , Gandalf arriving battle helms deep name . If look stories see eucatastrophe happen time Woodsman saves little red grandma , jack cutting beanstalk time kill giant , big bad wolf falling fireplace burning death . So intentional choice Lore wise said Eru God chosen path everyone throughout Arda . Luck , Fate , chance huge theme hobbit . The Dwarves Gandalf randomly choose bilbo Bilbo found ring accident . Bilbo also found Arkenstone mountain gold chance . Now things n't happen accident laid Eru ring would found later destroyed Frodo . If look early pages Silmarillion Morgoth Eru song creating melody ( getting deep lore folks ) . Eru told Morgoth matter always contribute Eru ultimate plan . So everything happened way supposed happen according Eru . ",1
15124,"Ok people , first , anyone besides one claimed read The Hobbit , actually read book ? Because sounds like either watched movie ( cartoon live action ) read comic book . The Hobbit NOT children ’ book simple fairy tale . You ’ missing point . Bilbo vital part story size . Hobbits general known large gardens , find peace small simple things , also speak small animals birds . The thrush NOT tell Bard missing scale . No one knew Smaug even missing scale Bilbo snuck cavern . The thrush one shared tidbit Bilbo , turn shared Bard . The humans Laketown long history Smaug . There magic arrow . Bard ’ father , Girion Lord Dale initially fought Smaug broke scale . Bilbo whole reason Smaug killed ! Also remember correctly , Gandalf always part story . HE one called The Eagles help . The dwarves never motivated greed . Thorin blinded time , initial motivation get dwarven king back . The elves simply ’ trust dwarves wealth driven Thorin ’ father mad . The Orcs Goblins plain evil . The humans seen friends family die , town leveled nothing rebuild . The ones truly entitled treasure dwarves , belonged initially . Bilbo Hobbit easy story . In everything throughout adventure , actions pivotal way including desolation Smaug . ",1
15126,"I always imagined The Hobbit something like campfire story told children age long past . All details pretty much gone , main story beats , lessons learned experience . ",1
15127,"When I read The Hobbit , charmed omniscient narrator ’ English voice , full colloquialisms time place . It come across story read told aloud children . But also dovetails well later trilogy . It makes think Rowling set universe—the initial books clearly younger readers vision grows increasingly dark grim mature series . ",1

15130,"The tone The Hobbit definitely children story LOTR epic fantasy whole bunch complex characters . You mistaken thinking The Hobbit little depth , finding dull much matter taste . It story development one particular character , whereas LOTR wildly complex character development . Indeed , plot LOTR depends heavily character development . You see characters pushed limits , see break , day saved friends . The Hobbit much lighter tone . LOTR much darker , melancholy , stuffed like Thanksgiving turkey hope faith possibility maybe good win end . Maybe like . Knowing story The Hobbit makes beginning LOTR make lot sense .

15153,"The LotR trilogy easily favorite series time , rivaled Harry Potter . I made point reread least main trilogy every year since sophomore year high school , 6 years ago . What I love much Tolkien universe , attention detail put work . I mean , man actually created language , several fact ! The way describes Hobbits Hobbit culture beginning Fellowship Ring rarely comes much importance later saga , paints vivid picture life like Hobbits I easily visualize head . Tolkien family tree every main character drawn , least , generations . A lot characters names never read see mention books , fact exist adds much world building . Now I consider diehard Tolkien fan , I feel compelled recommend novels universe : I start Appendices actually , end Return King . This gives lore takes place trilogy , along things like pronouciations family trees . It absolutely essential read along LotR trilogy , opinion . The book must read Silmarillion , Tolkien bible . Though reads like actual Bible times , brief overview everything happens LotR world ; creation end Third age , even hints events beyond . I find skipping certain chapters , n't feel bad find difficult read . The Letters JRR Tolkien nice read , indeed glimpse , mind author . Not essential read , add lore provides corrections explanations things adequately done books . The Children Húrin much smaller story length scale compared LotR books , measurably darker much sinister . I read two times , bit downer tastes , I would recommend nonetheless .

15179,"I think Tom Bombadil serves several purposes . He helper quest ( quest heroes traditional epics fairy tales generally run helpers exact qualities need ) , rescues hobbits first serious challenge , Old Man Willow , overcome . ( Traditional quest heroes also usually fail first challenge , Bilbo burgling trolls * The Hobbit * . ) Tom also demonstrates nature Ring . It feeds desire power . Hobbits , nature generally n't desire power , turn better guardians Ring creatures . Thus Gandalf , nature powerful , fears corruption Ring knows would corrupt desire use power good . ( Gandalf seldom exercises power within ; uses advice persuasion , believing free , domination . ) Tom Bombadil similar respect : great deal power , chooses use . He freely sets boundaries desires : master land , claim ownership beings within , belong . Thus desire Ring Ring hold . Frodo feels threat Tom possession Ring , freely hands Ring Tom asks . Tom remains visible wearing Ring hold . Frodo feel threatened Tom plays trick , making Ring disappear ( neat inversion usual power others ) , resulting Frodo playing trick : putting Ring becoming invisible fellow hobbits . But Tom ( literally ) sees , tells take Ring ( hand fair without ) , Frodo moment passes . Tom narrative lacks desire greater power possesses ; thus foil great power remain unsatisfied ( principally Saruman Sauron ) . Of course , Tom also isolationist , withdrawing engaging world . That ultimately indefensible position , figuratively well literally , Gandalf makes clear Elrond council : Sauron wins , Bombadil fall , Last First , Night come . In words , isolating solve problems world ; simply avoid responsibility solving likely get trampled end . Tl ; dr : Tom Bombadil purpose novel show desire power needs limited , also pitfalls isolationism . ",1
15180,"A lot explained book appendices . > Why world seemingly depopulated ? Why civilization dying ? The story LoTR takes place end age mythology beginning age Man . For history world , titanic struggle first magical races , like elves first men Numenoreans , forces literal evil - first god Morgoth , lieutenant Sauron . One things repeatedly mentioned books part power elves preserve things - since immortal greatly slows progress . Over time though elves leaving go undying lands , magic bring world still slows development . The world men seems dying real magical evil existed world constantly sapping energy human realms wars twisting men fight men attempt gain upper hand finally get rid elves claim world side darkness . There absolutely titanic struggles past wiped whole kingdoms sank continents left remaining humans kind survivors number apocalypses limited niches fill world still present influence power magical / evil world . > What hell things mounds ? What happened Kingdoms Wraiths ruled ? Why called Witch-King - immortal mage ? What happened Angmar ? They old kings seduced evil side things . That whole depopulated side Middle Earth used full human kingdoms , forces evil captured many , like Angmar , using things like rings power . Sauron gave rings power human kings region control people , kings died rings allowed wraiths continue existing bondage Sauron . Wars fought destroy evil northern kingdoms , area never repopulated true evil still lurked land active picking corrupting humans . So books really changing ages , fading away magical heroic past inevitable , necessary even sadly magical , human future . They way balance power works , things controlled beings n't interested change undying things become static withered attrition takes fatigue sets .

15192,"Here thing though : many things work books necessarily work movies vice versa . They 're two entirely different mediums . So movies n't give nuances books , pretty hard deny movies succeed showing grand , epic scale war . It like comparing apples oranges . I understand avid book readers get upset , honestly movies , anything , likely expanded readership rather caused people substitute movies books ( i.e . people want read books likely dissuaded watching movie ) . I think compliments one another , showing different aspect story . For instance , books Tolkien focuses mostly hobbits perspective embarking huge journey . And narrative strategy successful , opinion , taking reader along journey . But movies focused hobbits much books , would seemed strange ; movies tell visual story , expect see bigger picture ( e.g . Saruman new power rising speech two towers ; movie better job capturing epic scale ) ",1

It , unfortunately , hard read hundreds unpronounceable Elvish names characters , groups places . And 12 volume set The History Middle Earth contains ( understanding , I barely read pages ) many story fragments Tolkien wrote . I mention ground LOTR , never explains Sauron ending significant . Instead reading also really great lore videos youtube help put LOTR perspective . And one thing need remember going forward : The Hobbit book children . Each chapter little story 're meant told bedtime stories . The rest meant adults , take heaping teaspoon delayed gratification . ",1

If n't unpleasant , keep notes read A notebook , note cards , post-it pencil notes margins . I tend retain things better I write , I often . I reminded librarian friends many times famous , valuable books annotated famous owners . Today books may survive centuries , I like think notes would jog memory re-reading later , perhaps give character inspiration otherwise boring collection papers someone else might acquire . Watch ( rewatch ) one BBC PBS documentaries discuss books . Stick pre-2000 searches You Tube . [ one example ] ( https : //youtu.be/HkmNHP58OhU ) . They little slow , listen background perhaps . They discuss major story lines , making familiar characters places . They also offer insight myth origins book reflected world written .

I like think LOTR trilogy single 1000+ page story , VERY LONG beginning , middle end , rather 3 shorter stories , beginning , middle , end . That helps put rather boring first 200+ pages perspective . I also think reading Hobbit LOTR makes former interesting - Bilbo n't huge character LOTR , knowing story kinda irrelevant .

Hell , even soldiers ' psychology realistic ahead time , Tolkein using Hobbits explore different way war affect someone . Some people broken fault ( Frodo ) .

15532,"> Many people call greatest fantasy epics time , I seen others call convoluted difficult read . I n't think mutually exclusive : ) Keep mind Tolkien wrote The Hobbit children / young adults , wrote LotR adults . The two different tones , trilogy much darker . And somewhere halfway second book ( The Two Towers ) 're probably going want chuck , 'cause things slow crawl storm slowly gathers energy . But keep plowing ahead , payoff worth . It might easier copy something like Complete Guide Middle-Earth handy , JRR tends throw references ancient kings/queens/elves/forests/rivers/aliens/whatevers , useful reference WTF talking ? moments .

15533,"LOTR wonderful series , definitely worth time takes read . It quite dense , liked world hobbit , love way LOTR expands world .

All acceptable children book , n't work 're asking movie audience care thirteen Dwarves . Especially audience coming straight hugely successful trilogy Necromancer Gandalf dealt disappearance , numerous fan-favorite characters expected included The Hobbit , tons information Middle-earth/its inhabitants n't even exist The Hobbit written . There chance Peter Jackson could done justice book/universe single movie rushing Shire , Rivendell , Beorn cabin , Mirkwood , Laketown , Erebor , trying make characters ( i.e . thirteen Dwarves ) stand enough audiences care succeeded failed mission . tl ; dr two movies absolutely necessary opinion . Heck , I could even see three two-hour movies . Three three-hour theatrical versions bit much , though ",0

I also say reading Lord Rings early might bit mistake : I think I enjoyed ( willing revisit series later ) I waited later age . My reaction long-winded , verbose descriptions etc quite tiring slog point life . So : go Harry Potter . But 're ravenous expand reading , hobbit would great second step . As better : Tolkien far original , Rowling basically top game specific thing : accessible fantasy reaches broadest audience possible still retaining level flavour .

15782,"Tolkien prose truly divine . He n't get nearly enough credit , admittedly humble opinion . I heard many people say writing dry boring I honestly feel like people say n't actually read books assume way since stuffy Oxford language professor 1930s ! But writing gorgeous descriptive . It really rides line poetry prose way writers pull without coming pretentious overblown . Between The Hobbit , LotR , The Silmarillion ( favorite ) multiple passages literally moved tears first time I read . The writers I think done Steinbeck Shakespeare . That pretty lofty company ! ",1

In many ways I ca n't even describe , books changed life became standard I read fiction . During High School years , friends I become experienced D & D players , much detriment social lives , Tolkien works still inspired . It took three tries finish The Silmarillion ( still , took four five fully read The Bible ) . I guess I trying say , poorly , Tolkien made reader I today . ",1

15793,100 % excited . I would suggest reading The Hobbit . And maybe disciplining taking time . Digest might make LOTR enjoyable summer . We reading The Hobbit aloud 4.5 year old son gets excited every night read chapter “ adventure story ” . We skim overly descriptive and/potentially nightmare inducing sections . But large read . Enjoy . And share ! ,1

( It second book actual chapters I ever read . ) I still re-read every ( LOTR also ) still enjoy . It rich wonderful story , compelling characters , vivid descriptions , set complex enchanting world , told master story teller . ( Although , Tolkien n't good writing female characters . He wrote * * amazing female characters , n't well actually writing , instead writing . ) Do n't feel bad worry read book yet , enjoy reading . : ) And LOTR connected The Hobbit , set world , characters , events The Hobbit set things events LOTR . But different stories , different plots . The Hobbit personal journey , , point view main character . LOTR multiple main characters , changes viewpoints times , scope entire world . It also slower start , takes much longer big action scenes . Still , extremely well written book , well told story . But feel different times read . And watch movies , LOT left LOTR movies , though I think done quite well part . I n't bother go see third Hobbit movie , much changed drastically . It felt like alternate universe fanfiction Hobbit , actual movie version book . ",1
15796,"I felt Hobbit enjoyable book drag little , Lord Rings books suck right away . I read three first Hobbit good little letdown , opinion . So read Hobbit like , get excited Lord Rings even better story ! There reason Peter Jackson make movies first . Just juicer story overall . ",1

15809,"There noticable difference tone Hobbit LoTR , although first 150 pages LoTR set shire still carry light-heartedness Hobbit . So read beyond first 150 pages even n't enjoy , rewarded later . After hobbits leave shire drawn events larger world , tone becomes serious . Even though , I n't think Tolkien especially sophisticated writer . It storytelling uniquely masterful captivating , language style . The writing differs chapters . There empty chapters full descriptions nature architecture . There chapters slowly unfolding dialogue , revealing piece history illuminating new character , like Aragorn , Faramir , Saruman , Treebeard - favorite chapters . There still less satisfactory chapters seem rushed wrap storyline ( esp RotK ) . There chapters far much poetry . But always , stories window great legendary past , age Elves Men Westernesse , explored appendixes well Silmarillion . That makes book rewarding fascinating . ",1

15972,"I would n't say VITAL , characters references ( far ) popped fellowship . It definitely helps though , good read 're planning reading trilogy might well start w hobbit ",1
15973,"I ’ read LOTR trilogy twice . I ’ read hobbit 7-8 times . It ’ necessarily essential understand trilogy , ’ phenomenal book . It ’ favorite book : I look forward day daughter appreciate reading hobbit bedtime . The hobbit flavor excitement trilogy , ’ easy consume whole story shorter time .

15979,"Yeah , The Hobbit lead Lord Rings . ",1
15980,"I loved book far Tolkien writing . It different experience read english , much said distinct ways spanish . I encourage read hispanic literature get used way talk write spanish . Reading translations good , I bought The Hobbit . I would recommend , n't read yet , books Gabriel García Márquez . Maybe read smaller easier ones first . Like * No one writes colonel * * Chronicle death foretold . Twelve pilgrim stories * also good one . I recommend Gabo I Colombia favorite writer , I feel like I . Nevertheless , I would say best pick specific dialect spanish read learn . Any country pick would open whole world things enjoy . I love way languages different . For example , No one writes colonel good title original spanish , El coronel tiene quien le escriba , waaay better different version english . The spanish one gives feeling pure loneliness . Anyway , thanks advice I hope keep learning spanish . Es el idioma más bello que existe . ",1
15981,"I saw triolgies I , course , liked LOTR . And I reading The Hobbit , I began understan way people n't like movies . The Riddles dark part impressed . In book almost like horror tale . Gollum obscure creature feels way threatning . ",1
15983,Same ! We started The Hobbit kids started trying scare one another impressions Golum night . The younger ( 5 ) wakes older ( 8 ) saying precious creeper peering side bed . ,1
15984,Hobbit Book short easy read I love lotr I totally understand people hate n't manage get however hobbit essence children book light fun I recommend giving go ,1
15985,The Hobbit incredible excellent starting point imo ,1
15987,The problem Hobbit trilogy two films . The studio stretched hell back added much ridiculous fill took much creative liberties EVER allowed I even talking stupid forced love arc . ,0
15989,"As much I love books 're also without criticism . They often waaaay cynical reflective WWI . Some parts I would argue n't even well written narratively . The eagles relied many times , Theoden ' end wayyy depressing unfit great hero . The hobbits return Shire n't needed show much grown cunning strength , completely anticlimactic events Mordor . The way things depicted often n't fit overall theme narrative . ",0
15994,"I personally liked Hobbit better LoTR , nevertheless remains difficult adapt Tolkien style . I would try reading heck , though . ",1
15999,"I enjoyed Hobbit , found LOTR incredibly slow paced . I could never get past 1/2 way second book . ",0
16001,"Lord Rings much slower paced The Hobbit , characters significantly developed . LOTR honestly , lot ways , actually good novel , pretty unlikable n't appreciation highly specific strengths . ",0
16003,found hobbit kinda boring im liking lotr books way idk ,0
16005,"Making three movies Hobbit disaster . They added stuff Gandalf Necromancer based passages books , also lot needless CGI action scenes weird love triangle . ",0
16007,"I love much ! I ’ read boys nearly every day lives . It best part life , I ’ currently getting full leg sleeve tattoo characters favorite books - hobbit one ! It absolutely lead lifetime love reading , warmest memories . ",1
16008,"My son born 8 weeks early I read bit Hobbit NICU , . Things got little stressful I n't follow times amazing little guy ! ",1
16009,"The silmarillion possibly favorite book . Not middle earth series , book . Just n't read first . Go everyone saying , read hobbit , LotR , silmarillion . The silmarillion basically answer outstanding questions hobbit lord rings books n't explain . What hell gandalf saruman , sauron matter ? Whats balrog ? Where orcs come ? Or even men , elves , dwarves ? Who morgoth character mention one time passing ? Where hell entire world come first place ? Amazing book turns world middle earth simple story ring epic creation saga chronicling entire history world creation present . ",1
16012,But n't get discouraged read hobbit first find little immature . It children book LOTR trilogy adult oriented/more complex . Welcome lifetime loving Tolkien : ) ,1
16015,"Definitely The Hobbit first , LotR , everyone else said . I LOVE Silmarillion though . It easily one favorite books . If love history ( history books ) Silmarillion . If hate history books , probably wo n't like . ",1
16019,"I saw * The Hobbit * film ( 1979 ) reading book absolutely loved reading book . Although , important things left film , spirit books captured really well . The later movies much filler fail capture spirit book . They okay enough prequel LOTR films , good adaptation * The Hobbit * . ",1
16021,Well ca n't get hobbit I really would n't suggest even trying LOTR . As different dialog ? Because movie making people mean . ,0
16024,"> Those films terrible , I see could ruin person . I read hobbit I eleven I actually liked movies . Maybe low expectations , I never got hate movies . ",0
16026,"The book definitely war . War subtext greater story line . The book Bilbo , dwarves . That called * The Hobbit * . War much prevalent theme LOTR ( one book ) . But keep context statement - The Hobbit : watching ..... * The Hobbit * nothing war . I gave several themes concerning * The Hobbit * . Tolkien wrote books middle real , world war . The last thing wanted another story concerning every day life . He wanted escape readers . An adventure separates used lives . It meant emphasize things worth cherishing , even trials tribulations every day life , i.e . camaraderie , food , adventures , etc . Jackson wanted focus war . That brought character whose mention * The Hobbit * appendix - Azog . The reason mentioned book point Bolg father . Jackson didnt concern much Tolkien envisioned words . I doubt Jackson loves Tolkien works , dollar bill signs eyes wrote , directed , produced terrible trilogy . That helps explain fudge Legolas Ariel films . They added NOTHING films . If anything , detracted little worth films begin . ",0
16030,"I liked movie much seemed capture feel book . I liked 3D 48 frames per second capture came little closer I imagine head I reading book . It something makes sense every movie , movies draw rich literary background , like LOTR Hobbit movies , I think works really nicely . ",1
16031,"I went see today . Really quite liked . I read The Hobbit I guess I baggage knowing source . Perhaps people left door would enjoy fun , exicting adventure . I say perhaps one two scenes seasoned perhaps . The whole frames per second debate ? Did n't really notice . Some dynamic chase scenes little , . Go see leave book door I say . ",1
16032,"Personally , n't like . Sorry everyone loved , much random stuff shoved movie attempt make longer . Did need 30 minute sequence Ratagast running around ? And Ratagast weird , insane old wizard ? He shows briefly Fellowship Ring normal guy , albeit one loves animals . Also , need another 15 minutes council Rivendell ? Again , necessary plot , makers wanted tie LOTR . Furthermore , whole subplot white orc completely unnecessary overall plot Hobbit . While I enjoyed scenes , especially Thorin final scene , still simply shoved producers could turn three-part movie . I say I liked Gollum scene lot , large number dwarves ' scenes extremely awesome / fun . That said , n't need battle/running enemies every two seconds . TL ; DR : Movie need long , much shoved blatant attempt lengthen movie could 3 parts make money . ",0
16034,"I emailed coworkers I crashed midnight showing For edge seeing Hobbit work : Go . It epic fun , loosely adapted book snobs among regret giving chance . It tale tales twists , turns , Bilbo nailed every scene . ",1
16035,"I said I n't enjoy scenes . The one I really enjoyed Thorin final fight The Defiler . For god sake , The Defiler fucking hook hand . How cliche get ? But point Defiler White Council necessary overall plot The Hobbit . Sure , put , unneeded . The reason ARE , makers movie stretch 3 parts . This book need 3 parts . They easily could finished two , I would accepted could put important details . But bringing details mentioned briefly small sentences , Oh n't want go towards Necromancer , dangerous , completely unnecessary . ",0
16036,"I understand purpose white orc . And mentioned books . However , mentioned briefly , I remember correctly , appendix The Hobbit , merely fact killed Thorin , Thorin got name . My point could avoided altogether , turned 2 part movie , rather bringing random villain could make 3 . ",0
16037,"We seeing two completely opposite perspectives , I glad expanded . What irked reading * The Hobbit * Tolkien made off-hand remarks things seemed quite important , like brief mentions Necromancer . That movie resources scope expand like opening new exciting world . ",1
16038,"I thought movie took liberties almost immediately , went farther along , took . The barrel fighting scene river probably egregious . I loved Jackson Lord Rings , hated Hobbit . What I wanted second I finished watching second one take trilogy , edit crap , make one , good , movie . Someone else already done [ ] ( http : //www.maple-films.com/the-hobbit-fan-edit ) . The book much better . ",0
16039,I feel like stretching The Hobbit trilogy mistake . ,0
16040,"The worst part movies Bilbo interaction Smaug . In book , sneaks , engages Smaug battle wits , tricks Smaug revealing weakness . In movie , Smaug immediately gets Bilbo reveal , dwarves need run rescue Bilbo . In process , make Smaug look like buffoon , far fearsome dragon made . If want true version Hobbit , google Maple Films Hobbit . Some guy took extended Hobbit trilogy shaved 4 hours 30 minutes , removing ton stuff n't true story took away main plot line . The main injustice Peter Jackson taking The Hobbit making movie actual story The Hobbit plays second fiddle story Dwarves . Come join us Tolkien discussions /r/tolkienfans sometime ! ",0
16041,"I disappointed tone movies . They seemed lack warmth present books . For instance , Hobbits least , Gandalf supposed kind , funny old man could break awesome fireworks older people looked bad influence young . They idea powerful never felt need flaunt power . It supposed shock hobbits threw serious magical fire wrath . I think films missed aspect character . Same thing elves . The books portrayed powerful people silly , warm , kind preferred way . Elrond supposed wise , thoughtful , benevolent ; scary reboot Agent Smith I would afraid room . Galadrial books beautiful , warm , loving , ice goddess . Tolkein seemed employ theme forces good hiding power concerned happiness day day basis fighting war . I remember reading books kid immersed world I wanted visit . I desire visit world presented films . ",0
16042,"Might I suggest check Rankin-Bass animated version The Hobbit . It 1977 . And captures spirit book far better Jackson managed . For people like grew book ( first read around 12 years old ) , animated version better job ingraining one fondest memories . Plus great songs ! Let face . The Hobbit 1/3rd size LOTR . It probably 1 2 movies maximum . I agree Jackson n't capture spirit book . The book lovely children adventure story . Simple . Straight forward . The movie n't need Orcs . Nor liberties . The LOTR books great ! I think post inspired reread . ",1
16043,I actually liked Hobbit movies way LOTR ones . could done without azog romance subplots shorter barrel scene would nice along songs . I really liked movies took stuff Tolkien appendices Unfinished Tales flesh Gandalf/Sauron subplots . ,1
16045,Jackson really stretched Hobbit movies . They cut two films . Too much filler throughout . ,0
16046,"I felt Hobbit movies mistake start , announced trilogy . The story I read child single three hour film . Turning trilogy prime example commercialism finest/most disgusting . I watch three came Redbox , found first impulse completely right . Three films felt extremely thin mere shadows original film trilogy , I loved . A part still would liked see Guillermo del Toro would done films originally proposed . Might would crushed studio weight well , never know ",0
16048,I hated hobbit movies . ,0
16049,"I grew similar background , however father read Tolkien books young , adament going read us . My mother displeased , say least . When LotR movies came , watched admitted n't thought . Having grown books , experience different . While things I could nit-pick , I really felt like Peter Jackson amazing job . So I heard making The Hobbit I ecstatic ! The Hobbit one books I read reread , every time like visiting old friend . Then I heard going trilogy , I remembered thinking ? The movies entertaining , I guess , different book I could n't believe . It seemed like Bilbo n't even main character movies . Really upset . ",1
16050,"I n't seen hobbit films . I watched lord rings ( forced see three see I n't missing something ) , concluded either peter jackson never read books , english n't native language . I get behind choices , missed many things lost spirit essence tales . You see Christopher Tolkien say films ",0
16051,"That LotR films far better . They stayed true spirit books even taking liberties . The Hobbit films , though , dramatically different tone book made far weaker liberties far jarring . ",0
16053,"Wow , thank much incredibly detailed well written post . That fills much information answers many questions . When kid father would read Hobbit got older would read Lord Rings , always fascinated . As adult re-reading Hobbit LOTR , done reading ( The Silmarillion , Lost Tales , Tree & Leaf , Ect ) I used think knew much LOTR , met talked people like read extensive writings son . I really need get dive , im sure fascinating , Is book particular start find ? ? ",1
16055,"Oh wow ! It single movie , amazing ! Done 77 . One fondest memories childhood , I still watch time . It responsible love reading , since got hobbit , first real book I read . Enjoy ! ",1
16056,"I try watch ! I finished The Hobbit , loved btw . Now I try first book Lord Rings ^^ ",1
16057,"That move I always suggest people read hobbit lotr . It necessity , eases Tolkien Middle Earth . The lotr get little dry times , lot lineage mythology , whole nothing short life changing many others . I love able read first time . ",1
16064,"A bit late , search J.R.R . Tolkien The Hobbit . It fantastic edit point I forgot I n't watching real thing . Just n't get confused The Tolkien Edit , older fan edit . ",1
16066,"I similar experience , although arguably worse : back High School , I managed read 3 books Lord Rings * still * found underwhelming , vastly preferred Hobbit . The killer former probably expository dialogue slow pace , relatively dry style writing . But recently , classic fantasy kick , I reread Hobbit LotR , complete opposite experience . The Hobbit seemed little formulaic , adventure starting stopping increasingly predictable sequence . While book ended juuuust completely overstaying welcome , I still pretty eager get ride end . LotR total revelation . Things I previously remembered boring utterly engrossing , many details revealed adulthood I never appreciated teenager . What especially stood relationship Frodo Sam . The films course try best justice , even 30 hours extended material simply enough space time capture nuances go . By time reach Mordor , experience becomes exhausting almost difficult read—but best possible way . LotR became favorite fantasy book , remains . ",1
16067,"Try Silmarillion next ! ! Its nothing like either hobbit trilogy . It delves past histories middle earth elves whole creation . Like first start . I warn tho , first wont like . But dont put bcz becomes AWESOME . Ive obsessed books since kid . Enjoyy ",1
16068,"I n't able get LOTR books I 14 , movies came . I read Hobbit I 10 , I tried . many . times love Fellowship much I loved Hobbit never clicked . After watching first movie realizing I loved story stuff actually * happened * , I picked Fellowship skipped straight Council Elrond . After I hooked . ",1
16069,"Nice timing , I turn 30 next month finished reading trilogy first time two days ago ! I think experiences Hobbit LOTR movies fairly similar . I say trilogy really lot reading walking around , magic . Somehow captivating interesting ignites emotions reader related journeying , friendship , struggle , etc . ",1
16070,"I late bloomer LOTR books . I first got books I 10 years old bit heavy digest time . I picked 20s . I watched Fellowship Ring movie first going back books I think helped visualise story would go . Afterwards , I opportunity visit film locations New Zealand ; really made appreciate stories even . I read LOTR trilogy first The Hobbit heavy narrative trilogy , The Hobbit seems like breeze . Still lineup though Tolkien Middle Earth tales . My next target The Silmarillion The Children Of Hurin .

16071,"I made way Return King I bailed LotR That maybe couple years I saw movies theaters I early 20s . Honestly n't know I made far . They dry dull I expecting something vein The Hobbit like . Never thought bad books never told anyone read . They n't tastes . Have always said I would least make way RotK one day , reread entire series I doubt I ever . Every book n't everyone n't . There plenty books read , everyone make decision . Only one way find 're going like book : read . ",0
16072,"This makes want try trilogy ! I felt lot exposition hard get , even though I adored films read The Hobbit many times . I ’ give go soon . ",1
16075,"Began reading The Hobbit followed The Lord Rings son 9 , never previously read . It took almost year , reading 4-5 nights week . We enjoyed stories ’ many places story dragged . When reading books aloud , I always use different voices character make fun bring stories life . As I ’ previously watched films ( although ’ point ) , actors influenced choice voice/accent great deal , many characters challenge . When later watched movies together , remarked characters voices ’ imagined . He ’ ever aware using different voices accents reading ( think I almost lost voice several chapters reading almost entirely “ dwarf ” ) . ",1

16078,"No need feel ashamed . We different opinions . I liked The Hobbit could n't stick FOTR . I gave page five scene mushrooms . My dad dragged see movies I ca n't read LOTR killed favorite character . > ! I felt sorry Golem .... wanted better person , threw lava .... got hopes . I n't forgiven . ! < ",0
16083,"As huge lotr hobbit fan whole life though movies got progressivley worse . Fellowship epic , twin towers quite good , return king pushing 3 hobbit movies plain bad . ",0
16084,"agreed , lack music across movie franchise kinda let . major gripe hobbit movies loosely follow book . generally speaking stuff happens , scenes occur almost entirely differently book ( entire Beorn sequence comes mind first ) . also , kate lost love story never happened ? shmeh . LOTR movies loose , hobbit bad imo . ",0
16086,"I always preferred book Hobbit LoTR trilogy , Hobbit movies n't come close eyes . I love Lord Rings scale balance scale relatable characters . The Hobbit stood due simplicity core . The dwarves wanted go home . The movies focused reasons , bigger picture stuff I felt like I loved Hobbit lost transition screen . ",0
16087,I mostly agree . I feel like films became victim success . As ( LOTR movies ) progressively successful Peter Jackson given free reign make decisions . Then came The Hobbit films producer due bit del Toro situation every idea greenlit pushed without oversight comes unproven blockbuster director . Sometimes less people around asking rethink idea say No times helps creative process . ,0
16088,That given . You never film good book hobbit best film adaption I see far . Just annoyed 1 song ,1
16089,"The hackneyed love story elf dwarf painful watch . The cinema​tography river barrel scenes horrific . They looked like something someone filmed go pro kayaking . And decision use three films instead two bit iffy . The Hobbit small , self contained story . Two movies would better , took three entire lotr trilogy . ",0
16091,"I massive fan novel , I n't care tuppence fidelity . The film could completely different still potentially amazing . Or could slavishly faithful still potentially amazing . The problem : faithful unfaithful , The Hobbit films n't amazing films . They n't even good films : * dreadful * . Rather write must thousanth time every issue I The Hobbit films , I recommend anyone reading watch video ( subsequent ones ) , explain perfectly issues hollow cinematic money-grabs . https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=TijkFnT8D-U ",0
16092,"Loved books , loved movies . I think I may vast minority ( least far loving Hobbit films ) . I disappointed couple things Hobbit films , though . One lack Beorn Hobbit films .

I * really * like Tauriel character I glad added I actually liked relationship Kili , I read somewhere actress agreed films condition would love triangles So bit shit . ",0
16093,"Oh yes , many people feel way . I liked LOTR movies , genuinely good job working art style , makeup music made fit , I displeased changes made story characters . Eowyn loveable , strong headed , feminine character book , made brat films . Not sure , sucked . The chase Rivendell rescue Frodo also quite boring film , compared book , simplified much . Never seen cinema , apparently death Saruman extended version , bad mistake opinion . I kind understand left bit Tom Bombadil , simple skip feel nothing lost , memorable part first book gives depth . - As The Hobbit films : They insult . ",0
16095,"While books great ( Hobbit movies definitely lot problems ) things work books n't work mediums . And Tom Bombadil probably perfect example . It n't serve purpose mystery would bloated already epic length movie . It also another example character confronted chance take ring turning , would 4th 5th character first movie alone . ",0
16096,"Yes , I disappointed movies , especially * The Hobbit * . Like , LOTR , I eagerly waiting see would portray Tom Bombadil Goldberry . I upset I found left . ",0
16097,"I disappointed The Hobbit trilogy , overall poor movies bad pacing lots action sake action n't serve story . Battle Five Armies particular terrible . The Lord Rings trilogy , however , remains favorite films time . I mean scenery , costumes , story , god acting fantastic . There movies I love characters much I love characters Lord Rings . Yeah , films n't Tom Bombadil , would n't well film . He makes interesting case world-building epic story , would serve little positive purpose movie . I said I say , works books necessarily work well film . ",0
16098,"The LOTR movies great , I real problems stuff missed changed . It stayed pretty true story good job telling LOTR effectively screen . With Hobbit , I must admit particularly liking first couple movies initially , seeing I think great job . However Hobbit movies , n't telling story Hobbit , telling larger story things probably happening Middle Earth time setting scene LOTR . So portray story Hobbit well movies ? pretty much times got little lost setup War Ring . I would love see Jackson going back Middle Earth , possibly focusing events lead , related War Ring .. even better pick Silmarillion , Unfinished Tales Children Hurin . ",1
16099,"The first half Fellowship joy . The Shire lovely , lived-in place full characters descriptions beautiful . It key rest story need feel Hobbits left behind every stage adventure . The depth detail part book much effectively movie scene ever could . ",1
16100,"Glad 're enjoying ! And yeah , hobbits much fully characterised mature . ",1
16101,"I also currently reading LOTR first time believing I would hate whole life—at point I kid I heard absurdly difficult dull , I kinda soaked . I glad I decided read . I way The Fellowship already looking forward rereading I n't want reread books often . They immersive . Have read The Hobbit ? But I feel way several classics . There many books I forced read middle high school I probably would gotten much ( terms enjoyment , also terms understanding/processing ) I allowed * read * . Having read ( actually : skim ) 250 pages per night top homework answer questions random , tiny ( usually completely irrelevant ) details prove I done completely ruined experience reading , yeah , reduced enjoyment reading whole awhile .

16102,"If want really push enjoyment book , get map Middle Earth . Get colored pushpins start tracking journeys characters . It really helps visualize world better suddenly realize close barrows really Shire . How far course crossing misty mountains makes fellowship . How layout land allows Rohirim safeguard Shire much human lands orcs coming Mordor . Both hobbit lord Rings novels characters traveling across middle Earth running trouble . Tracking travel really fun way figure fits together . ",1
16103,"The 8th grade I first read The Hobbit LotR . I tore books . Only put I - like class . My oldest brother ( 6 years older I ) got box set . When finished one book , I read . Except I finished The Two Towers , taken The Return King weekend camping trip . So middle brother took store I bought copy RotK read oldest brother returned camping trip . So , ironically , I started books finished set . I read many times since . Both movies came . My favorite way read The Atlas Middle-earth beside incredible reading experience maps open reading happens sites . It gives whole new dimension books . > Years later movies came , know incredible Not n't . There parts good , I think LotR , movies n't even cross mind . It books . When I read books , I visualize nothing movies . As I said , I read books many times . Last time I saw movies The Return King theaters . And I go rest life without ever seeing movies .

Use Harry Potter ( something similar less problematic author ) , The Hobbit , Watership Down , must tons 'literary ' works still modern valuable read , heck , end might even throw Romeo Juliet sonnets Shakespeare Donne . I fairly lucky HS could freely pick books read . Other schools pick certain number books certain era , going back medieval times .

16107,I actually surprised find The Hobbit written 20 years earlier LOTR . ,1
16109,"The Hobbit first book , generally better stand-alone read entire series , The Hobbit much concise story . ",1
16110,"I personally think one interesting things Hobbit character Bilbo . He fat , lazy , decadent aristocrat gets sent mission way actually prepared , yet manages hold , even thrive new environment . Exactly unlikely hero , never insincerity , describes fear , discomfort , pain . This makes character relatable , story exciting , imo . That said , Tolkien clearly afraid using various Dei ex Machina , may perceive weakness , I personally feel fit style fact bit tale children . As general unpreparedness , n't nature adventure ? Nobody knows exactly journey store , make , go anyway , worth trying . ",1
16111,"Unpopular opinion time : I first read The Hobbit 5th grade , told like Harry Potter better ! I hated . I found slow boring dwarves basically character would far easier everyone Gandalf gone killed dragon seriously competent person whole story . Twelve years later , I decide reread The Hobbit movies going awesome ( Martin Freeman , Lee Pace , AND Benedict Cumberbatch ! ! ! ! ! ) . I figured I matured reader maybe I enjoy book adult . Nope . It still slow Gandalf still deus ex machina whole time . I heard The Hobbit generally regarded one Tolkien weaker works , I guess best explain feelings ? ",0
16112,"I read Hobbit loud son recently , I bit disappointed ( read kid ) . Frankly reading Harry Potter enjoyable . But perhaps Lord Rings much better . ",1
16116,"You identified lot people think pivotal point Tolkien writing The Lord Rings . For first 10 chapters , Tolkien writing story sequel Hobbit , kind skirting around edges rest stories writing spare time since early 20s . But clearly defined point finally decides yes , new story writing actually going part wider world created background , Aragorn says line I tell tale Tinúviel . It great universe introduction small story Aragorn going tell well serving universe message Tolkien , finally going let us one stories First Age , serve backdrop rest story . Also sidenote , finish Lord Rings , best backstories serves contained book * The Children Hurin * another great tales First Age , never gets summary treatment LotR like Beren Luthien . ",1
16117,"It one moments remind Tolkien always interested world lore main plotlines books . He spent years creating lore ages Middle Earth , mythologies histories main races , even creating entire languages , drawing maps , . He drew heavily existing Anglo-Saxon materials made without planning write Lord Rings . Then wrote The Hobbit set world , people demanded , eventually created story Lord Rings , already incredible world wonder ready set epic . Also , I sure thread full people saying already , : like best Lord Rings world-building epic lore , really ought read Silmarillion , covers entire epic history world , creation successive ages , moves pseudo-religious battles gods mythic history toward time LotR , closely resembles actual history .

16118,"Tolkien books worldbuilder's/lore lover paradise . I yet encounter anything quite like . Most author subscribe notion everything must serve plot . And maybe Tolkien vastly different , grander concept constituted plot ( story whole world ? ) . Or maybe n't give damn . But many tangents virtually nothing plot . Tom Bombadil biggest example . He 100 % unnecessary plot , chapters could excised entirely , nothing stating hobbits found swords old burial mound , even got Rivendell . Nothing happened chapters touches anything else entire rest book . Yet adds much * world * Tolkien building . Those chapters show ancient , mysterious beings unknown powers , remains kingdoms hobbits never knew existed . Hints world far bigger , far older , much discover . And book filled stuff . Seeing elves making way Grey Havens , book Balin tomb , little songs , various bits languages scattered , fact Helm Deep named person history go , entire chapter lore dumping Rivendell adds flavor world , helps exist beyond characters ' horizons .

16594,"Sadly I yet come across anything captures vibe The Last Wish way I like . I found vibe unfortunately kind unique . After Sword Destiny even Witcher series changes fair bit ( morphs epic fantasy ) . One thought might want try old school sword & sorcery like Elric Melbinone , Conan etc . Part also wonders something like The Curse Chalion Lois McMaster Bujold . It long book , single pov involving curses/demons medieval setting , although & monster hunter . As far Witcher series , mixed bag . I loved The Last Wish Baptism Fire Geralt heavy . I loved Geralt character wished series actually focused . Most books 3.5-4 star vicinity , although I n't fan last book Lady Lake . ",1

And , I seriously confused arranged , I saw interview book author tv show runner author talked one would buy story made several short stories found way combine .

Now , I think ’ fascinating way give enough world characters want know , much ’ thinking yea yea yea skiiiip . It ’ also first book omniscient viewpoint I ’ read liked .

I starting Blood Elves , lot big characters ( Dandilion , Ciri , Yennefer , etc ) introduced fleshed short stories 're missing lot back story . The Last Wish consistently awesome throughout I found last two stories The Sword Destiny much better important four preceded . ",1

16612,"Yeah I find royal ranger books boring . I n't know Falaise last book , , sucks final book ",0
16613,See I disagree . They reminded lot classic RA books . They favorite Royal Ranger series far . ,1
16617,"I think one reason rangers apprentice books always largely character driven . The plot setting ok main reason people read characters well written likable . However , royal ranger changes . Our characters take backseat new ones ’ know . I ’ think inherently bad thing , I mean brotherband well new characters . I think ’ royal ranger first came ’ ’ series , book 12 rangers apprentice . So readers go expecting see characters know love find background characters . If read go knowing ’ sequel series I think fine , going expectation old favorites going another adventure make book disappointing , regardless good might . ",0
16618,"You need read Brotherband , give character familiarity , n't need understand plot Royal Ranger series . ",1
16619,"It sad many authors make mistake . Instead finishing strong , fall prey trying continue , whatever reasons , profit caving fan wishes continuation series - continuity consistency gets worse worse storywriting , 're left monstrosities like Royal Ranger series Rowling Cursed Child ",0
16620,- The Ruins Gorlan - The Burning Bridge - The Icebound Land - The Battle Skandia - The Sorcerer North - The Siege Macindaw - Erak ’ Ransom - The Kings Clonmel - Halt ’ Peril - The Emperor Nihona-Ja - The Lost Stories ( short stories ) - The Royal Ranger - The Red Fox Clan ,1
16623,"I finished Battle Hackham Heath today I say felt little underwhelming . A lot might part already kind know things going end . Seeing already read Tournament Gorlan though I say finish Early Years moving Brotherband . There stuff happens The Royal Ranger coincides Brotherbrand , I read first background knowledge . ",0
16625,"I would go The Brotherband Chronicles , ’ fun break main series , go The Royal Ranger series . It ’ really bad . Give shot . It ’ undo anything , anything adds even depth characters ’ come love . While new ranger ’ apprentice Maddie main character , o.g . characters ( Will , Halt , Horace , Gilan , Cassandra ) still prominent roles . It ’ really cool seeing Will senior ranger mentor , ’ really come full circle started . ",1
16627,This far favorite series ever I think I read main series 6-7 times honest I ’ read royal rangers . The writing feels lazy plots feel recycled point . The royal ranger series nowhere close good main series opinion unfortunate much I loved rangers apprentice . ,0
16630,"The Lost Stories really interesting , . I recommend backstory entertainment ; I sure 're relevant Royal Ranger , 're worth reading . ",1
16632,"I would n't torn , honestly original cover much attractive . Although I would n't buy Royal Ranger series period lol ",0
16633,"I glad still releasing . I biggest fan Brotherband series , I excited second book Royal Ranger five year hiatus . I still find new books enjoyable , maybe I n't read dozen times like I original Ranger Apprentice series . Anyways , I think Flanagan end series final book ( maybe two ) finally brings together two casts . Will Halt never met Brotherband crew , I expecting finally meet last arc . ",1
16636,Why dislike Royal Ranger ? ,0
16639,"As far I know , short story included one regular books English version . The English title The Beast Another Time . I think one Brotherband books , I remember correctly back The Caldera . They wanted promote Royal Ranger series . However , promotion neccesary Netherlands Royal Ranger series n't seperated regular Ranger Apprentice . Therefore , published seperate novella/short story . ",1
16642,"My favorite probably story ( set stories I think ) Horace Cassandra wedding . As Nils says , everything could want wedding ! Will Alyss ' wedding nice , I remember bit short . Actually , one Roamers might favorite . I feel like story best Alyss whole series . About next book , yes something controversial happens , books good rest series ( though statement quite controversial ) . I urge continue reading Royal Ranger series . ",1
16643,"You get lot together Royal Ranger series , mostly book 1 . ",1
16647,"It second book new series , started The Royal Ranger . ",1

16664,The Royal Ranger . ,1
16666,"I agree killing stupid . I would problem right way . However , killed nowhere . I mean going kill character deliver emotional punch . At least , build character scenes character killing her/him . In Royal Ranger series , n't even good job showing effects death Will . Aside fact , angry nothing else . Him apprentice IMO John kill Alyss without expanding impact death Will . That said , Ranger Apprentice Movie/tv series must eventually kill , else wo n't . Edit : I n't know watch RWBY , certain character died . The writers many faults series , brilliant way , fans really learn impactful death another character . ",0
16667,I really sad shocked read Alyss ’ death The Royal Ranger tbh I ’ glad ’ Halt . I love Halt dearly . ,1
16668,"Honestly , I dislike Flanagan villains . All villains arrogant dickheads , ’ bland . He getting better tho . The Caldera Royal Ranger books much interesting . But one thing I noticed HE SUCKS AT DEATH SCENES , THEY HAVE NO DRAMA AND ARE SO LAMEEEEEE , whole Maddie scare thing worst thing books . The good “ death ” Halt ’ poison , cousin Nihon-Ja ( forgot name , sorry ) ",0
16669,"I agree would adaption due need fit story another medium . However , I feel like killing would betrayal John considering major point Royal Ranger books . Now said , premise/ idea ( killing ) could good . However , John unfortunately messed execution ( pun intended ) . ",0
16670,The Royal Ranger The Red Fox Clan Duel Araluen ,1
16677,"Tbh , I kind created alternate reality maintain sanity , Alyss never dies Maddy ’ spoiled brat , never becomes ranger . I still read Royal Ranger books , ’ way worse original RA series , ’ sure . Love RA , love Brotherband , despise Royal Ranger ",0
16678,If like Dracula need read The Dracula Tapes . BS Dracula written POV Vlad Tepes . It pretty entertaining . He spends lot.of.the book shit talking Van Helsing . ,1

16707,"Read last year , great novel ! One thing I specially enjoyed Dracula character ! > ! He n't mindless monster , nice gentleman , spiteful , prideful childish creature , characteristics alive reflected death . Characters study life work order predict next moves . That kind good writing something zillion movie/TV adaptations desperately lacked . No wonder Christopher Lee wanted play like book , never got star proper adaptation . ! < ",1
16709,"I heard Dracula pulled older story called Vampyre , written time frame Frankenstein , vampire heavily based Lord Byron . Might worth checking . ",1
16710,"Dracula lot Being organised analytical . Knowledge power Mina link . She compiles data , journals , print outs , package , copies shares group . Why much lore .

16729,Been loving Dracula Daily ! ,1
16736,"I mean , I imagine people n't realize much stuff invented codified Bram Stoker book . I think assume classic tropes already part longstanding mythological tradition , , like every modern vampire writer , would play around traditions . He almost certainly invented n't appear mirrors bit , instance , possibly based one two stories described lacking shadows . Another terribly funny part , course , Dracula also sorcerer , graduated honors Scholomance , school evil magic run devil . His ability turn animals , hypnotize people , instance , perhaps meant instead inherent vampires . ",1

I met Saberhagen socially couple times science fiction conventions 1990s . I hope I thanked properly . Edited add : The Dracula Tape makes point saying several times Jonathan Harker locked Victorian propriety ( also , mentally dense ) genuinely lived vampire castle weeks months noticed . I think Keanu Reeves portrayed perfectly Coppola movie . ",1
16900,"The short version Stoker ’ descriptions men obviously written somebody attracted men . And , novel heavy erotic undercurrents , gives little attention women . The sense ( emotional ) intimacy male characters given much attention supposed love interests . In one scenes blatantly ( hetero ) sexual , Dracula interrupts proceedings jealously declares man . Stoker closeted gay man . He knew Oscar Wilde ( believe may lovers ) , Dracula written right around time Wilde imprisoned homosexuality . Read context , themes repressed socially unacceptable sexuality come even louder clearer . ",1
16903,"I agree ! When comes Quincy novel , I think maybe part creating foil highlight certain things Dracula represents .

16908,"I actually finished Dracula thought excellent , especially beginning castle . The build great creepiness Dracula made cringe . Well worth read . ",1
16912,"I definitely preferred first half second . The beginning eerie : Jonathan Harker going strange foreign country , meeting people palpably afraid disturbed , finally getting Dracula castle eldritch experience nearby forests . The castle equally horrifying , get experience scares Harker intimate epistolary prose . I even enjoyed section Lucy Westenra , Jack Seward , Abraham Van Helsing . I loved Van Helsing character enjoyed Westenra death resurrection . The Renfield bits interesting , retrospect , I wish Stoker expanded bit . I surprised well book held , especially since I think horror tends date really badly . The characters also great , one felt like real person I quickly worried fates . All kind putters . Oddly enough , even though stakes ( pun intended ) raised book came conclusion , I became less less invested . It could n't capture dread I felt Dracula castle helplessness watching Westenra turn vampire . Overall , I enjoyed felt quality fluctuated .

If read Gothic works dated much Dracula , focus terror aspect leans toward psychological side . Dracula still probably easiest read , whole genre fantastic imo . ",1
16918,"I love first part . Everything castle sets creepy atmosphere parts get really tense reading , specially night ( least experience ) . Then story leaves castle kind slows gets little hard finish . Overall I liked experience implications maybe Dracula n't really heterosexual sometimes portrayed , I think book drags areas . ",1

16930,"I loved . It took minute things really build one great things classical writing n't rush climax . The backstory dialogue gives characters time assess situation realistic way . Bram Stokers 'Dracula ' scared absolute heck . The way tension builds plateaus without immediate resolution gives story strength I feel like lot modern story writing driven potential make movie characters less likely make mistakes assumptions 're following story line . Dracula older novels n't . They n't rush , characters n't flawless even particularly bright , 're existing circumstances realistic fears determination . I really enjoyed book read simply fall line characters thinking behavior . It scary , unexpected , n't moments characters judgement situation n't justified whether correct assessment . You make want reread lol ",1
16932,"One thing I take away book , besides easy read great story , HAUNTING .

16940,"I really n't like . I trying remember . I think Dracula came across silly undignified much threat , final confrontation total anti-climax . I say someone loves 19th century novels . The original Frankenstein amazing , I thought Carmilla better Dracula . EDIT : Although one thing I remembered ( I think I recall correctly ? ) I thought cool n't really appeared vampire mythos since suggestion Dracula arose mindless monster slowly great deal time develop mentally learn emulate noble appears . The modern portrayal leaves part . ",0

16945,"Dracula definitely top 5 favourite books . First , I like format , epistolary novel well-suited story . You see feel characters see feel helps us get mood novel . Discovering Transylvania Jonathan eyes really makes feel I stepped far strange land , nearly I gone back time ( sometimes condescending ) descriptions . Then I like Ur-example vampire story still surprising elements . As said , first start reading , think going like every vampire story find elements stories ignored like fact sunlight n't harm , prevent transforming whole native soil thing . I also like fact old gothic castle see every gothic novel whole setting novel . It appears beginning end rest story set Modern England ( well , modern book written ) . You go Whitby London , 're stuck Transylvania . And speaking modern , I like modernity novel : science modern transportation heavily used Mina definitely modern woman . Alright , scientific discoveries made science used book outdated ( blood transfert without knowing blood type instance ) still feel Stoker used latest scientific disccoveries novel . And , said , scary , unsettling , good point . Some unsettling scenes beautifully written wonderful atmosphere , like Dracula arrival Whitby . ",1
16946,"Reading bit Dracula vampires kept draining Harker odd cliched , chill spine sensation . I get phrase . The book really good damn , movie went rails couple places . ",1

I always loved modern vampire fiction ( pre-Twilight ) , I thought I know vampiric powers/ect . since Dracula big basis lot modern stuff . But I n't ! I guess Dracula old modern vampire writers deviated enough stereotypical vampire I picture n't entirely accurate book dracula . A pleasant surprise . Similarly , I liked Frankenstein reasons . It little dense ( though I listen audio book , perhaps affected enjoyment ) , still really good . We know modern references monster , source material different enough feels fresh . ",1
16950,"It ’ one things I picked I like gothic romanticism think vampires cool , fully expected bit brick . Nope ! I surprised much “ human story ” turned . Sure , atmosphere chilling count rad , something positive touching depiction relationships band heroes I came away book feeling warmed . Not way Mina cares Lucy men , way men concerned well , though initially brought together interested woman . The parts book stuck passages one characters would offer blood transfusion another one already weak , way ’ stand guard outside Mina ’ room .

Dracula , story , novel , character , nothing like imagine - much like Frankenstein . It ’ testament story Dracula become part popular mythos , tragedy see happened spotlight , pun intended . ",0
16958,Interestingly I started listening podcast recently highly recommend listen Pleasing Terrors - episode 025 A Vampires Heart . It gives interesting insight author perhaps another reason Dracula came . ,1
16959,"The first 50 pages brilliant . After shifting perspective narrative robs narrative momentum , I think . But many brilliant sequences ever adapted faithfully movie first 50 pages , especially sequence ship Dracula arriving England would make truly incredible set pieces . ",1

The tension race time till sunset exciting enough . The epilogue ( 7 years later ) really sweet nice see strong group friendship remained .

17198,"It favorite book . Stoker amazing English . Virtually entire book gets excited language . You try Lair White Worm Stoker , liked Dracula . It also fantastic . : ) ",1
17199,"Just finished Dracula well , I enthralled ! Way complex I imagined . I think Dracula Frankenstein great companion reads , especially imagine contemporary worlds . Very different , similar topics . Frankenstein , , danger new tech unreformed world . The ego loneliness Dr. Frankenstein taint works . Dracula old evil , made dangerous growing globalism labyrinths bureaucracy . Each fault ivory tower science ignoring ancient works folk wisdom . I read epistolary works , unique many characters featured . I felt creates narrative distance , I ready characters die , since someone else could finish tale . Especially introduction note ; almost 'found ' quality . ",1
17200,"Frankenstein way better Dracula imo . The first 60 pages book far best . Then kind goes downhill . I remember reading pages pages words ’ contribute story . And ’ even get started final showdown Dracula . How completely underwhelming . I ’ glad liked , I ’ see reading anytime soon . ",0

17203,My first experience actually musical I read right . It interesting musical expanded relationship Dracula Mina turned sexually tense one fall love . ,1
17208,"I first picked Dracula middle schooler , airport bookstore , order pass time announcement decent weather delay . It incredible read ( somewhat enhanced spookiness simultaneous listening Phantom Opera musical London Cast Recording ) . I re-read book high school book report , fun analytical . Then year I took German class vampire literature film ( 1700s remake Nosferatu ) university , found even greater richness reading . There excellent motifs duality existential confusion ; Dracula well-layered book . If 're interested classic vampires , I would suggest Carmilla Le Fanu ( It older vampire story vampire female , first story introduce lesbian vampires female , rather male , human side vampire-human relationship . It also interesting approach story unreliable narrator ) ",1
17209,"I love Dracula ! It one favourite books definitely favourite classic . I love scenes almost seem like satire , point I wondered Stoker meant like . I read Frankenstein thinking I love ok imo . ",1
17211,Try Jewel Seven Stars next . It obviously lesser known maybe captivating dracula I also enjoyed lot ,1
17212,"I recently listened ot audible loved . It amazing voice cast ( Simon Vance Johnaton , Tim Curry Van Hellsing ) . I actually surprised ending I seen Gary Oldman movie since I kid could remember plot points . I knew lot modern media Mina Harker vampire/Dracula bride surprised happen . Now I pissed media bastardized character mad vampire love Dracula . ",1
17213,It oke favorite books ! I official edition contains dialogues pages lost due censorship languages . Reading Dracula English best . ,1
17217,"I ’ like books I forced read school . Being forced read book told means test teachers interpretation book always felt like waste time . Which sucked English teachers always cool people , I ’ help despise class . I ’ never much film . The I knew Dracula ( film word mouth ) probably goofy Van Helsing movie way back ! ",0
17218,"Interesting , I still yet read Frankenstein I find idea narrative letters/journal entries super fascinating since writing fact happening present . What things Dracula loved stuck ? ",1
17219,"That part great ! Another part I really liked early part shaving glass Dracula reflection . Jonathan ’ first kind big clue dealing something unhuman . So cool , whole part Jonathan Castle Dracula amazing . ",1
17220,"I agree . Like I said , I ’ fan Mina much first man grow . She strong character driving force group . Though moment remove groups actions love well definitely one needed stay farthest Dracula . But , comes back telling ’ going go changed mind , ’ even second thought . Immediately Van Helsing like “ Sweet , cool please , love Mina. ” They know strong useful member group , even different reasons ! ",1
17221,"That ’ really kept . Although I really enjoyed teams dialogue watching slowly fit together pieces , meat Dracula moments . Like I said , really , mist thing going mess lot , season coming soon ! I completely captured whole time Jonathan ’ stay Castle Dracula . The moment shaving glass pulled kept ’ grasp ! ",1
17223,"Definitely , ’ unfortunately huge differences written medium visual medium . I give props people give hand trying make adaptations , sometimes changes make absurd ! The main one I ’ seen post Mina falling love Dracula . How dissapointing ! This woman , fully human time , still looks female vampires horrific disgusting ! This ’ woman would jump Dracula ’ bed I think text makes obvious . ",0
17224,"Same way I felt Dracula ! I ’ excited delve Frankenstein . I ’ currently wonder greek mythology , going dive japanese mythology . Then I ’ probably get library card get Frankenstein ! ",1
17225,"Fair enough . It definitely feels like lot happened looking back copy 400 pages . The portion Lucy definitely feel like rinse repeat bit , still enjoyable . I think I liked watching group characters come together try fight monster . The ending definitely somewhat underwhelming , hunt find outwit fun . Besides , best bet vanquish Dracula far mostly helpless sunrise sunset . Dracula general interesting monster way weaknesses rather plain . You got holy wafer ? You better , else ’ dead . But even though weaknesses plain powers cool ! An interesting balance I suppose . I ’ definitely check Frankenstein ! ",1
17226,"The final showdown huge let-down , added racism , boot . I think Frankenstein wins social commentary/philosophy , basically know going end beginning , Shelley gives details mechanics . Dracula lot adventurous , I guessed Hollywood ending , shifting narration kept pretty open : n't riding one character survival . Stoker gives cinematic scenes , imo , Shelley leaves imagination . ",0
17227,"Which musical ? Probably 10 years ago , I bought movie musical 'Phantom Opera ' amazon . So later Amazon recommended 'Dracula ' musical . I shocked , I n't even know 'Dracula ' musical . So course I ordered ( DVD ) . This musical produced Canada French . ( I n't speak French . ) It n't quite I expected , watching several times , I decided I really liked I went Amazon order CD music . I looked 'Dracula musical CD ' , much surprise , Amazon showed CD different musical , German one . Not one , two 'Dracula ' musicals ! So I ordered German CD ( I speak German . ) This CD ended changing life . I immediately fell love lead singers voice , led investigating musicals , ultimately led 'Tanz der Vampyre ' ( Dance Vampire ) , favorite musical time . I made friends The Netherlands , Germany , Austria I meet every couple years go see musicals . I Berlin , Hamburg , Vienna , Magdeburg , Stuttgart met extended family I n't seen 40 years . I plan going back soon possible . This obviously way need know words 'Dracula musical ' fond place heart . I understand least two Dracula musicals . I one around somewhere ( n't like much ) second Frank Langela starred . ( He went start Dracula movie-not musical - quite interesting . ) ",1
17229,"It really changed mind horror books . Preface , I ’ huge whimp ’ like many scary things . I always thought horror books ’ effective would good imagined well enough could stop got scared ! But , oh wrong I ! I actually enjoyed scared book ( ’ like scared movies except maybe like zombie movies ) . The part Draculas face kind seen dark Carfax really tripping trying sleep couple nights ago . But I kind liked , I ’ always hated scared . And time season I suppose ! ",1
17230,I ’ watched much anime definitely seems like would interesting take Dracula ! Being done different culture I ’ sure interesting different spins . ,1
17235,"I gave Frankenstein first go right Dracula ; took three tries finish . The beginning dreadfully boring . If find way , I highly recommend powering first couple chapters . Once gets good stays good end . I still like Dracula better though . ",1
17236,Exactly ! Also I thought Dracula brides 're much frightening screen adaptations . Everything I castle unsettling . I may add book annual reading list . ,1
17238,"I really enjoyed book , I really loved Renifeld I found character quite interesting eating bugs spiders gain life serving Dracula . Also mild complaint might personal taste , reading picture Dorian Grey Dracula I n't know call old English ( really know I mean ) kind puts makes characters seem somewhat emotionless unnatural . I n't know I new reading may crappy reading something . I course loved unique structure book using journal entries kind like book equivalent found footage horror movie I quite liked . Also finished book Halloween pretty badass lol ",1
17240,"Oh I agree ! There moments getting bit later night book definitely took edge ’ already spooky nature . The one got I room lamp reading see Draculas face somewhat darkness . It probably minds playing tricks , I noped shut book night ! ",1
17241,"I would definitely suggest make annual reading list read October ! Seeing spooky decorations front peoples houses I reading book interesting thing . Like right time set Dracula . The scene brides , Mina , Van Helsing infront Castle night terrifying . I ’ even imagine horror endure , even inside Safe Wafer Circle ( SWC ’ called business ) prevents vampires even getting near ! It ’ like trying write scene character bit inland sees shark water , situation real danger scary , thing ’ even get ! And yet , scene effective terrifying though characters safe ! ",1
17242,"Fascinating take ! I get sense 'cutting edge ' , , blood transfusions telegrams . Part horror Dracula also making use newely connected world . ",1
17244,"Right ? I loved Stoker keeps reader guessing . Everything connected , hard see done . Is Renfield thrall ? Had vampirized ? How long Dracula grooming ? Has Dracula caused insanity first place ? ",1
17245,"Oh man , 90 ’ Dracula awesome . The cast awesome . Gary Oldman plays Dracula . Keanu Reeves ’ “ accent ” might bit distracting . Winona Ryder , Cary Elwes , Anthony Hopkins . It ’ definitive Dracula movie . ",1
17247,"Oh definitely ! I intermingling classics books I reading ( mainly Lord The Rings related things moment ) . Just couple I read ( Dracula included ) I enjoying classics much . The last one Dracula , I thoroughly enjoyed , The Sea Wolf Jack London . Loved ! I try give Great Expectations another chance wow . ",1
17248,"The way Harker describes watching Dracula scale walls outside , I never thought book could give Goosebumps ",1
17249,"I read couple times . I really liked story number really strange goings-on seemingly inexplicable . The strange women castle Jonathan , instance . I always assumed vampires , n't seem deteriorated Dracula . The story shipping containers grave earth excellent , really shows kind evil forethought goes invasion Britain plan Dracula . Renfield obsession consuming life interesting . Not vampire , almost like trying emulate one best way . And Mina attacked monstrous beast repeatedly , fed Dracula blood . It clear ordinary vampire , interesting see far powers go . I agree last third book less satisfying 're pretty sure point victorious . The real tension left whether Mina survive well . ",1
17250,"It since I read , I pretty much agree assessment . Overall , great - good reason classic . It certainly several steps novels I read - * Jewel Seven Stars * , * Lair White Worm * , * Lady Shroud * etc , adapted film interesting results , aged well text . However , I read earlier works . There short story - originally intended opening chapter * Dracula * - worth look though . It * Dracula Guest * . The shorts eponymous collection generally worth reading . ",1
17251,Great book whats really interesting Dracula story aristocracy preying peasants finally overcome new educated middle class . ,1
17252,"> watching Harker stumble confusion , denial , finally horror resignation course letters really brought menace Dracula existence I forget , certain comedian great routine * Dracula * great example British class-system work . Harker sees kinds incredibly fucked things castle , thing finally convinces something unnatural going * count servants ! * ",1
17253,"There school thought one consistent threads Dracula condemnation character virility upper-class Victorian Englishman . FFC Dracula certainly takes ball runs . The effective men story Abraham van Helsing ( Dutch ) , Quincy Morris ( American , specifically Texan ) Dracula ( Slavic ) . Jonathan Harker complete wet noodle writing paprika chicken recipes Transylvanian peasant women sobbing begging go castle . Then get threads infidelity pretending virtuous , etc . Dr. Seward runs 19th century insane asylum - definition quack . And Arthur Holmward exists ? Is name page ? It interesting thought exercise , since easy forget Bram Stoker Irish , English . ",0
17254,"Just finished reading day . The Christian horror different suspense murderfests day . The fear Dracula beyond becoming vampire death . It eternal separation God afraid . You read Van Helsing speeches Lucy . You see greater fear soul body . Later , Dracula moves Mina . He able seduce feast upon husband sleeps next . He bypasses free threatens eternal damnation . It mark given wafer marks realization happening . The mark akin Biblical sign unclean unable partake sacrament . What I really appreciate book New Woman avoidance cliche . Mina active player book . It traditional female helpless woman perhaps never existed anywhere prejudiced dreams , rather one based Biblical women Deborah . The mixture Reason , Christianity , Paganism , Old World unexplainable make interesting mix . Nowadays debate reason mystery Agnostics ( Atheists ) pitted Christians . In past , Christians scientists . What consistent need man provide reason great mysteries life along life way showing endless supply things mettle reason . ",1
17255,"I liked first Act book lot . The way letter format keeps us kind dark ; pace Johnathan discoveries growing dread ; indirect organic way hear peasants ' folk wisdom ; imagery atmosphere castle , surrounded mountains brooding forest I enjoyed second part well ( especially sequence involving shipwreck ) , Lucy death . Around time several things took , : -The incredibly poor communication heroes , particularly Van Helsing , even bunch dialogue importance sharing information . More generally , gross negligence protecting Lucy . -The book parody-of-itself portrayal gender relations . Maybe reflection era , laughable much time spent talking weakness women need rest protection . Perhaps Stoker trying draw attention problem , caused least one oh ! moment plot , felt dumb . -The vibe whole thing kill vampire Lucy begin hunting Dracula . The pacing style devolved point pulp , I felt suspense , characters ' combination melodramatic solemnity ridiculous ineptitude made whole thing almost laughable . Edit : TL ; DR I disappointed . I n't think considered classic . Stoker good ideas : letter/diary format , similar claustrophobias characters ( space , suspicion ) reader ( information , dramatic irony ) ; ultimately failed execute way deserves title classic . I want read retellings , see people develop I consider rough draft . ",0
17256,I finished reading English class ! Honestly beginning n't really pull especially letter formats I came part Dracula invaded sailors ' ship got interested terrified Dracula powers . ,1
17257,"I read literature course teacher also explained shows new technology ( typewriter , blood transfusion , logic , science ) winning hierarchy , class , superstition religion ( old way things ) . Also Dracula sexually awakens female victims frees repressive Victorian lives . ( Victorian males view horrifying symbolically rape stake ) . I found interesting still one favourite books ! ",1
17259,"I liked John part book best . It kept turning pages mounting horror despair , exactly I hoping . I thought second half book , particularly end , fairly boring though . I idea books like time I n't know would flown , I would liked somewhat darker . Dracula talks big able predict every move blah blah blah , first seems like back claim , end escape seems kind desperate , act somebody truly aces sleeve , disappointed . The whole time tracking boat , later carriage , I kept thinking Okay , NOW gon na spring trap ! never materialized . I also thought kind lame nobody among vampire hunters really flaws . They acted like perfect knights Arthurian myth ( except even guys occasional flaw ) . It read less like real account happened like someone idealized revision events , given nature writing I suppose possible . But man , I taken drink every time someone overcome chivalry selfless acts someone else group moved tears , I dead even finished tracking dirt containers . I glad read , I glad gave us vampire genre . Do n't believe I picking . ",0
17260,I read literature class . My professor us draw thought Dracula looked like based descriptions . That realized Stoker basing Jewish stereotypes ,0
17261,"Dracula novel easily hooked first pages . I love genuine suspense built first two-thirds , atmosphere Harker visiting castle first time . One thing I also enjoyed ( I find horror novels n't well ) Stoker wrote band human characters sympathetic able show genuine affection one another . The oath Lucy suitors Van Helsing swear ( later Mina ) rather powerful . ",1
17262,"I read year ago really enjoyed . It really interesting read book see vampire fiction got ideas vampires . For example Buffy ( Willow comes gay ) , episode Willow becomes vampire attracted to/seeking women later goes back human says something along lines Wow , vampire little gay one characters says Actually vampire makes . This reminded Lucy vampire suggestive/sexual , basically letting inhibitions/society expectations go true self . I also still trying make sense weird 3-wayish scene men walk Dracula bed passed Harker Mina drinking blood chest . I read Dracula part college english course focusing monster lore . My professor big fan theory baby Mina end novel could Dracula hinted sexual encounter . Not sure much I buy , scene really strange . ",1
17263,Now read Anno Dracula . I kind stumbled across bookstore like month ago . It reads lot like high quality fan-fiction exploring world Dracula n't die fact seduced queen Victoria slowly took England . Everything throwback Gothic literature time . ,1
17264,"Dracula great book illustrate role culture literature . The way story framed highlights relative modernity Victorian society . Great attention payed use shorthand typewriters well trains transportation modern time . This technology seems quaint us , Dracula written , would served reinforce disparity heroic , modern Anglo protagonists superstitious , antiquated Eastern European villain . Horror stories great telling us story contemporaries feared . In case Dracula , conflict much modernity science vs. antiquity superstition . This central conflict points towards fear embracing technology cause us forget important traditions weaken moral resolve culture . The moral decay component especially strong Dracula considering beastial sexual nature villian attacks Lucy Mina . ",1
17265,"Somehow words look seem accord , else cast face made smile look malignant saturnine . One favorite time pieces classic literature . A riveting adventure remarkable depth fantastic writing ! Dracula provides wealth richness , complexity , humanity , charm , horror vampiric fiend many think already knew ubiquity culture . But original Count Dracula far cunning , calculating , blood-curdlingly maleficent one might suppose . And let forget truly fantastic cast characters Count , Van Helsing , Jonathan Harker , Mina , Lucy , Dr. John Seward ( My favorite character book ) , lunatic Renfield , countless others ! ",1
17267,"Dracula one time favorites . What I especially love fact book created vampire archetypes : Jonathan n't clue meets white-faced , claw-nailed , saber-toothed host , , weird cultural metacognition lets us recognize The Count comparing prior knowledge Dracula ( phew , wordy ! ) . Also , 're campy movie adaptations , watch Bram Stoker Dracula version . It totally intentional B-movie adaptation well cast ! Gary Oldman kills Dracula , Winona perfect Mina , Tom Waits greatest , best choice Renfield ever could . I absolutely ADORE twisted old man , know music , know perfect choice , . ",1
17268,"Love Dracula ! And cool minute ( ) technology - typewriter phonograph forth . Try The Woman White - kind format , nice spooky bits awesome twist-like bit middle . Marion Halcombe great heroine , reminds Mina lot . ",1
17270,"My favorite part Dracula journey England . The way stalked crew ship , picking one one suspenseful . I could see spiritual predecessor Alien . ",1
17271,"Read ago , think I generally agree , esp concerning last part book . Once get leave Britain go , kind footnote point . It I n't * really * remember things like writing style , I quite enjoyed But man oh fucking man scene Dracula ship comes port , storm , dogs howling shit happening - stuck forever . Got ta one evocative scenes I ever read , honestly . Too bad Dracula threat basically never emerges point . : p ",1
17274,"I glad enjoyed ! I recently finished Salem Lot I recall someone stating thought reading Dracula , Salem Lot , I Am Legend ( order ) made pretty good ( unrelated ) vampire apocalypse trilogy . But yeah , Dracula amazing I would also recommend Dracula Guest maybe The Historian ( companion piece ) . ",1
17275,"I read post someone made months ago reading Brahm Stoker Dracula , Stephen King 'Salem Lot , Richard Matheson I Am Legend succession great trilogy vampirism . I completed Dracula couple weeks ago , loved , honestly loved book I Am Legend . If 're looking read vampires I highly recommend two books I mentioned earlier . : ) ",1
17276,I highly recommend Frankenstein even mildly liked Dracula . They really good books . ,1
17277,"Oh man ! One faves ! I think Jonathan gets judged unfairly sometimes readers . Dracula one books lot unfounded speculation - based Irving ( actor ) , Vlad Tepes , Bram actually went Romania etc . You might want read Elizabeth Miller Dracula : Sense Nonsense books Dracula origins myths speculations . I also recommend manga Hellsing based book ah taken 11 . ",1
17278,"I glad posted ! Dracula , despite read years ago , probably favorite book . I n't know , I loved first moment meet Dracula ( coach driver pulls town , I remember correctly ) . The foreboding comes universal silence behalf townsfolk sets tone novel perfectly , opinion . Also , driver speeds night , leaving coach behind . Absolutely thrilling . Kudos read one ! ",1
17279,"I actually finished writing 17 page research essay book ! ( On Victorian sexualization ) . I actually happy see someone else see value book , really talked anymore . Id agree epistolary narration something I really enjoyed reading , gave us sense helplessness though reading journals/letters/etc helpless unable help . It added element realism mind least . Might well mention thoughts sexual side things since I wrote paper ; well essentially Stoker broke silence , showing grim sexually corrupt side Victorian England , virtually authors Europe 1800 would even mention . Of course also see Stokers opinions women regarded ; specifically religion . Mina Lucy may real female characters book , far focus along side perverse Count Dracula . Without going much detail , women seen sexually vulnerable easily 'corrupted ' temptation lust . Lucy spoken extreme writing , whereas Mina kept true beliefs represented angel archetype Lucy devilish counterpart . Doing research writing side story made even fearsome book behold . Scary stuff !

17280,"I know n't popular view - must classic reason - I really hated book . It years I apologise vague details I understand need read within context time , casual sexism , calling children 'it ' etc n't bother . ( Animal Farm , example , feels simple unsubtle today interesting reading within context written . ) I thought characters lacked depth motive development . What really bothered core message book . At point early part book Dracula anything wrong , hated 'being monster ' . The whole book felt like archaic christian parable , moral absolutes story Lucy metaphor sex outside marriage . I even went far time reading attempts give blood transfusion 'fix ' 'fall purity ' paralleled abhorrent belief raping lesbians would make straight . ( That news lot time , maybe influenced ) . Anyway , I thought whole book really one-dimensional lacked redeeming qualities . I realise I probably read sometime , life short read something I disliked much . I really want read Frankenstein though , anyone I talked Dracula says similar developed themes . ",0
17282,"I personally loved book , I say lot visuals I imagined reading influenced film adaptation Gary Oldman , bad thing per se , though definitely n't want keep visualizing Keanu performance every time read Jonathan Harker , nevertheless , I found book entertaining . On similar note , find , read novel Carmilla Sheridan Le Fanu , another Irish author wrote vampire story several years Stoker , served inspiration Dracula , well worth read , another jewel Vampire/Gothic fiction . ",1
17283,"I actually opportunity visit Dracula Castle Transylvania Brams Stoker went get inspiration book . Reading book afterwards , really cool think view castle surrounding forests mountains Stoker describing Harker point view goes visit Count . It really made book come alive ! ",1
17284,"I read one almost every year I since I 9 10 years old . It pretty challenging read first time I young . I suspect format would still challenging many adults today n't avid readers . The journal entries showing different characters perspectives creepy situation nobody fully knows going creates atmosphere feeling quite like anything else I ever read . I think helped turn voracious reader . I chasing feeling ever since . The closest I come finding elsewhere reading Peter Straub . Ghost Story creates similar effect different , entirely dissimilar manner . He gives us 5 alternating points view creepy situation start dreaming deaths . I agree last part Dracula n't nearly enjoyable . The mystery solved effect gone . Stoker works n't good , either . I highly recommend anything Straub , though . ",1
17286,"I read Dracula I quite young , maybe 10 . It bit level I enjoy one stories inspired love horror . For years I read , I could n't look window night fear something coming .... one reasons I enjoyed . It twenty years , I re-read . I know stand test time ! ",1
17287,"I read I twelve years old , since I blown away Francis Ford Coppola movie released around time . I remember I stuck pages I finished . Because age , literature favourites likes Tom Sawyer , Little Women , etc Dracula definitely one first books left mouth wide open . I tried get movie adaptation Bela Lugosi , I couldn´t really get . The F.F Coppola one definitely best I remember . ",1
17288,"It one favorite books I ever read . Stoker great job making Dracula creepy right start . Dracula mysterious creepy . Plus , way actions described people adds creepy atmosphere . It shame lot powers vampire possessed lost many modern interpretations . Stoker vampires seemed unreal otherworldly , even though Johnathan would see eyes . The ambiguity Dracula death solidifies mystique . Dracula 'killed ' turns smoke , stoker vampires anyway . So truly dead ? Personally , I lost little interest story shifted away Johnathan Castle . Do n't get wrong , rest story comes together wonderfully . I grown attached Johnathan character definitely felt absence second part novel . It characters started catching going Dracula I felt book started pick back . tl ; dnr Bram Stoker Dracula classic good reasons . Easily one best novels I ever read . ",1
17289,"I ( trying ) read book week year , Dracula book 12 ! I also writing reviews , I thought time I finished : WEEK 12 : Dracula , Bram Stoker . Jonathan Harker solicitor tasked going Transylvania assist one Count Dracula buying house England . Once arrives Castle Dracula , finds pretty promptly Dracula weird dude , leave , trapped castle . Once sees supernatural goings , surmises ’ gon na let place alive , manages escape , goes mad process . Back across pond jolly old England , Dr. Seward , sanitarium manager , starts noticing strange goings new neighbor . Jonathan ’ missus , Mina , friend , Lucy , fiancé Arthur get involved , Seward call old teacher , Dr. Abraham Van Helsing save day . What follows story intrigue , love , loss , bravery . This cool book . It written epistolary format , word I look make sure I got right ; basically , ’ written series diary entries letters , newspaper stories thrown . Therefore , reads like detective story great dramatic irony - information characters , hence feel lot tension . There ’ great bit ¾ way perspective characters met , decide pool knowledge - recorded various journals letters - read ’ stories , hence better chance hunting vampire . I like think Bram Stoker ’ keep track knew far book . It ’ little weird reading foundation iconic monster character . All vampire tropes - ’ daylight , hates garlic Christian iconography , turn bat , sucks blood places people thrall bidding - ’ interesting see dealt original context . One ’ really come much Dracula command wolves , turn one . There ’ also weird telepathic link thing one victims forced drink blood , hence becomes linked thrall command . It ’ definitely cool though - Stoker good job set list rules monster must follow ( Van Helsing basically spells early book ) sets detective work crimes based rules , gets characters figure . The main theme I could see book madness ; one faced horror undead foe , one help go mad process ? Especially impossible ask help authorities , no-one believe story ? How , one judge conventionally mad , may different objective viewer ? This supported quite well prose - introduction book , Jonathan Harker heard several chapters , went mental escaping . It takes months return former self , Van Helsing confirms happened - self doubt mirroring fears nobody believe tale . Dr. Seward ’ patient Renfield another interesting case ; already patient mental institution , Dracula starts messing placing thrall , nobody trust believe conventionally mad . The burden unbelievable truth old trope ( back Cassandra Greek myth ) , works really well , keeps 450 page book interesting . I would recommend book . It ’ gripping , well told thriller good characters great villain . There ’ lot good prose , use different voices different characters entertaining ( Dutch Van Helsing ’ slightly broken English used example ) . While little long winded times strong opening 65ish pages ( page-long paragraphs pain arse read ) , mostly stays focused , pays end . BOOGIE ON DOWN , IT ’ S QUOTES TIME BABY . “ What manner creature semblance man ? ” - Our Count seems… “ Why men noble women little worthy ? ” - That good female characterisation Bram . Keep good work . “ For life , , waitin ’ somethin ’ else ’ doin ’ , death rightly depend on. ” - Some fisherman wisdom . “ All men mad , way other. ” - Who judge sane ? “ I tried keep open mind ; ordinary things life could close , strange things , extraordinary things , things make one doubt mad sane. ” - The importance shutting belief encountering monsters . “ Some people see things others . ” - Sometimes , got ta trust madman . “ When men believe even see , doubting wise men would greatest strength. ” - The Count , using human nature advantage . “ We want proofs ; ask none believe us ! ” - A good closing message book .

17312,"Dracula great example social political trends work late 19th century , specifically feminism , expressed literature fiction . The feminist movement ( women liberation ) full-swing England late 19th century . As social movements , detractors railed change , Bram Stoker sat firmly old-school conservative camp women stayed home , stayed quite , took care husbands children . This novel expression Stoker conservative anti-feminist views , dire warning dangers female liberation . Case point ; two female leads Mina Lucy . Mina traditional , conservative , pure . She pursued corrupt carnal Count Dracula ultimately prevails due virtuous conservative nature . Lucy however modern woman sexually liberated , shuns tradition making choices , liberated lustful nature leads conversion vampire . As vampire Lucy becomes antithesis proper woman . According traditional values , woman purpose wife mother . Lucy brazen sexuality allows corrupted Dracula turned vampire . As vampire Lucy becomes anti-mother feeds bodies children instead feeding children body . Stoker equating women liberation absolute inversion woman . That liberated woman dangerous , destructive , incapable supporting traditional family unit . It direct corollary Stoker fear feminism lead one great classic horror novels . ",0
17313,"Loved book I read years ago . The build fantastic really kept edge . The ending I felt bit rushed ( seems even realize happening ) , n't detract overall story imo . If liked Dracula , really look The Historian Elizabeth Kostova .

Imagine trouble could saved everybody said first thing . ",0
17327,"You thought ending satisfying ? Honestly seriously disappointed . I always feeling like cheap ending like thought book would n't sell humans didnt prevail end . So entire book hes really building dracula , saying hes strong 20 men extremely clever war general life lived hundreds years split twos kill easily .

17335,"It absolutely fantastic book several strong themes , especially sexual themes/symbolism got slipped . My absolute favorite theme book came theme Van Helsing embodied . Namely , master 'old ' 'new ' worlds greatest advantage/power . None characters first much knowledge advantage Van Helsing one ( ) people still bothered studying 'old ' sciences etc . He combined knowledge old archaic 'new ' technology time help effectively combat Dracula , characters brought speed team , gain power . Hence end book mystery power Dracula gone Dracula run life .

To extent even considered horror—I never feel fear I watch them—these modern series resort occasional—or frequent—gory interlude—which usually viscerally disgusting , anything else—to punctuate horror , whereas Stoker artful . In Stoker ’ version , refinement part coldness . Dracula ’ attempts hospitality leave Harker chilled . Dracula equal parts aristocrat literal horrifying monster—beastly demonic , true incarnation evil . The latter often absent modern series . ",1

17687,"Regarding gender stuff , I say Carmilla gets points toying Very Victorian idea beauty = goodness . Seriously , number stories era , Dracula included , immediately tell someone trouble due conventionally attractive . It actual belief time criminal deviant behavior sort showed face ( Dorian Gray also plays ) . Nowadays 're used character femme fatale , ( example time I think Milady Three Musketeers ) time Carmilla looking acting like sweetest innocent thing imaginable actually monster bit subversive . Also female character stronger smarter males , time rarity . As sympathetic , still monster , whereas Dracula shows zero positive traits throughout book , Carmilla couple . Like showing signs guilt actions , trying rationalize part nature , fact apparently good person life ca n't help . Whereas Dracula shows remorse complexity , life , well , actual maniac Dracula . I would n't say better book , Dracula better plot . But Dracula character Saturday morning cartoon supervillain . Every adaptation tried add nuance , guilt , affection victim , borrowing Carmilla . She interesting character less interesting story . ",1
17688,"I say Carmilla good book worth reading , particularly 're interested horror/vampires . I say Dracula great book , I recommend anyone even particular interest horror/vampires . The Vampyre important book interested horror/vampires , I n't think league Carmilla ( certainly Dracula ) . Maybe one books I need reread , also one books I ca n't really find enthusiasm reread . ",1

I think going feel much familiar readers modern ( read post Interview Vampire ) vampire stories . The ending defiantly anticlimax , I ’ think Baron completely blame . Part point view character business monster fighting climax . Hard fit non tragic climax protagonist like Laura . It ’ also notable early example beautiful innocent looking monster hunts manipulating assumptions people would make “ frail ” creature . That angle would transgressive time . The woman dropped Carmilla also one tantalizing unsolved mysteries fiction . One thing I say I ’ convinced relation meant lesbian .

17974,"Men openly crying together actually older thing ( needs come back ) .

We 're currently leaving weird century long blip case . And modern history classes n't seem justice fact ; making seem like men always toxic closed-off emotion-bottling stoics . I think Herodotus recorded one army battalion sobbing joy together seeing ocean first time war . And even MacDonald ( Scottish Victorian author ; mid 1800s ) consistently depicts vulnerable/crying/scared men also courageous , intelligent , resilient .

18041,"I agree assessment . This book great Dracula actually , surprisingly little . The parts ship , poor crew n't know going , especially chilling . I think expressed wrong hero characters way I trouble nailing . They angelically noble ( problem I Dickens characters ) therefore respond stress way , makes constant worry get annoying even though well founded . Van Helsing especially seems spend half time mawkishly telling Mina wonderful whenever worried turning blood sucking vampire . I guess relates various sexual subtexts suggested novel , I found side harder relate . The epistolary format another thing I n't sure . It works time I n't know whole bulk novel requires . Often character say something like , What long , tiring dangerous day ! And tomorrow ! Let spend hours writing detail I get rest The climax also little disappointing . [ * * * spoilers coming * * * ] The heroes race across Europe beat Dracula castle . Dracula spends time asleep box . They manage catch destroy time .

18053,"I read book I think misogynistic . I even found rather visionary /modern time . Sure might included stereotypes women according time written . But I find Stoker writing purely genius even daring Victorian era mindsets . Lucy character clearly antonym ideal Victorian woman . She bold curious girl even described erotical ways parts book . Instead appearing child caregiver , turned vampire , preys children ! That kinda destroys old fashioned idea women attentive children constantly look . As creepy sounds , yet amazing idea Mina heroine , last point view . She clever played major part Dracula demise . She clearly helped men build plan take . Even Van Helsing admits , point , probably would never succeeded catch Dracula n't Mina intelligent planning . I really love book I find lot interesting ideas coming women portrayals ",1

18073,"> Like Dracula character allegorization anything everything feudalism ? Of course . He Count . He literally feudalism flesh . He underlings bidding , whether force magic .

But stranger strange land ( England ) , one ; men know not—and know care . * This line says - Dracula leave fief , kingdom everyone learned fear ilk centuries , embark journey England , treated like anyone else , longer power control . > Feudalism ended 1400s . Seems bit odd concern would occurred Bram Stoker 1897 . But point . Dracula * lived * 1400s still used living way even 19th century , novel tries make clear Transylvania hardly changes . > I also hardly think characters novel 'enlightened ' except Professor Van Helsing superstitious . They mostly products enlightenment . Seward , psychologist ; Mina , teacher ; Harker , solicitor ; Quincey , American . Van Helsing literally * * superstitious fellow bunch . He one ruled existence vampires . ",1
18076,"> You misunderstand . Superstition belief something based one ’ reason knowledge . In world novel , vampires obviously exist Van Helsing knows prior experience impossible superstitious vampires since would fact possess prior knowledge vampires well fact novel vampire . Van Helsing * * experience vampires prior meeting Dracula far I recall . This makes belief vampires superstition . He never encountered vampires ; merely heard , reputed , means destroy . > Feudalism existing small patches remote areas Europe enough convince Stoker would concerned interested feudalism would industrialism , capitalism Marxism . I find big stretch Stoker would cared topics writing book . I mean analysis , . We never completely certain Stoker mind writing book , surmise . Nevertheless , passages refer dichotomy old , feudal world Dracula modern , industrial world Harker team . For instance , observe Dracula initial anxiety moving bustling cities England , away kingdom held sway centuries : > Well , I know , I move speak London , none would know stranger . That enough . * * Here I noble ; I boyar ; common people know , I master . But stranger strange land , one ; men know not—and know care . * * I content I like rest , man stops see , pause speaking hear words , ‘ Ha , ha ! stranger ! ’ I long master I would master still—or least none master . Then , Harker later states fears , despite technologically culturally advanced , contemporary England may invincible unknown powers : > It nineteenth century up-to-date vengeance . And yet , unless senses deceive , old centuries , , powers mere “ modernity ” kill . All , I think possible Stoker commentaries going writing , either subconscious secondary main point ; undead . In end , I think still , like Godzilla , King Kong , Call Cthulhu , cheesy monster story , analyses try conjure presupposed deeper meaning behind text theories . ",1
18077,"I argue protagonists hardly religious , least initially - fact religion element overlook , dismissing mere superstition eventually finding thing used destroy Dracula . But yeah , seemingly incestous polyamory definitely odds Victorian norms certainly used heighten exotic grotesque aspects character .

18079,"I one LOVED Dracula . I love format letters , journal entries , newspaper clippings , well different points view come together . I also enjoyed prose , interplay theological sexual undertones . I definitely sympathize frustration characters though . They tend make silly judgments , overlook important information , often * * wrong things pretend know lot . Especially Van Helsing . When first showed , I thought funny little polite educated foreign man . But much said , even beyond dreadful grasp English grammar , made little sense .

Seems fishy . But I think success Dracula presentation . It presented novel , legend , fiction . It makes promises , gives eerie manuscript compiled ragtag band folks facing something n't understand . So I agree often blunder screw repeatedly , I think lends credence atmosphere discovery discovery , reader . You entitled interpret manuscript characters made . So realize something , pulls , makes part , adds infuriating level irony . Anyway , I sorry n't enjoy like expected . I read months ago one favorites . ",1

I slightly underwhelmed ending much I let ruin entire book . ",1
18102,"I read Dracula total four time far . The first time around I pretty young felt bit underwhelmed book . Granted , even Jonathan journal castle horror fan paradise .

18108,"I thought great read epistolary style kept plot flowing , Dracula suffers malaise affects almost horror novels . The form best expressed short stories ( Edgar Allan Poe , H.P . Lovecraft ) extending novel length tends introduce melodramatics soap operas . I also think critics readers rather simplistically dismiss Dracula symbol repressed Victorian sexuality , although suggestive scenes throughout . ",1
18110,Diary Exposition style famously used survival horror like Resident Evil effectively started Stoker Dracula great ,1
18111,"Yeah , every book Stephen King , frankly , books worth reading . Writers love drop names books influenced book ’ writing . So The Stand get Lord Rings Watership Down .

18162,"I finished reading Frankenstein school ( well , re-reading I read . ) To honest , I find Victor Frankenstein absolute idiot , especially due obvious intellect .

18163,I enjoyed Frankenstein much . Dracula much . ,1
18164,"We become spoiled horror suspense . Especially movies . Every release tries outdo ones , something old Dracula might seem little basic , riveting published . ",0
18165,"Reading modern times I think still * creepy * , particular opening chapters Harker Dracula , would agree n't scary . However , I reading I kept imaging someone reading book century earlier candle/lamplight imagined would particularly scary . I read excellent Oxford World Classics edition novel , annotations great job highlighting cultural context time would made novel frightening reader back . This sense fear would shaped lesser understanding science back century greater belief placed organised religion supernatural . There also often cited view novel also plays sense unknown rest world , even simply mainland Europe many people UK Ireland would relatively unknown mysterious place time , shrouded myths . If think Dracula foreign enemy , arriving boat strike fear heart London . An example really stood blood-transfusion scenes , Van Helsing characters attempted revive victims Dracula . The annotated version explained relatively radical dangerous medical procedure time , would injected even greater sense danger scenes . ",1

18169,"I finished I thought scary ! The parts Dracula castle characters danger suspenseful , storytelling style journal entries multiple characters ' perspectives opens possibility anyone die chapter . Also , I nagging thought Jonathan bitten escaping castle would reveal later book . For someone knows story already exposed lots horror stories ( screen book ) , though , I see would n't scary . ",1
18172,The part Jonathan Harker tries kill Dracula shovel pretty creepy asked . ,1
18177,"Aside things people already said , Dracula much better candidate iconic villain . Carmilla Laura friend , even though ends dangerous , Laura n't really want defeated . Dracula framed monster defeated character beloved ways dangerous others . * Dracula * kind created vampire think today , whereas Carmilla vampirism sort vaguely discussed , Van Helsing character shows end rather part big hunt bad guy . I really like * Carmilla * * Dracula * I think lot ways * Carmilla * interesting * Dracula * , * Dracula * kind kickass story bunch friends teaming defeat monster something lot potential widespread success ( ton adaptations ) .

I saying makes worse , harder adapt make popular big hook . ",1
18180,"There far much heavy breathing , eyes cast side , reddened cheeks , I think . The overt sensuality two women pretty big time . I think helped inspire parts Stoker story , overall tale Dracula bolder action . ",1
18181,"I n't much add except I read Carmilla today bc I stumbled upon post , thanks talking ! I really enjoyed ; fun , racy ( time ) novella , I surprised I n't heard . I n't read Dracula yet ( although I familiar film versions ) , I ca n't really answer question .

While obviously n't mean actually desires modern context would still considered rape sexual analogy , I feel like things could interpreted seduction . Edited I thought : I also disagree Dracula supposed symbolize foreigners . I n't know general fear foreign cultures taking victorian England , I n't think Dracula would good analogy , n't really represent culture : alone , manners beliefs ( beliefs ) shared countrymen , fear avoid . In opinion , actions n't reflect back onto country origin . I admit though , I n't know enough say whether general manners behaviour based racist stereotype eastern Europeans prevalent time . ",0

The ending n't fit , seemed bit anti-climatic , especially since chase Europe drawn . I think Dracula , novel , suffers little bit nowadays legend much bigger book . As someone brought 90s , I already clear image I thought Dracula reading . I think pop culture Dracula completely different one literature , perhaps difference disappointing . ",1
18209,"I personally liked Dracula , I see neat horror story . Not amazing anything , engaging entertaining . I like comment I n't think ending predictable .

Eventually doubts dissolved , earlier I liked I must say , I would n't call predictable . ) Another thing struck ending [ Spoiler ] ( # Quincey death . It n't feel sad good anything , felt really odd . My guess never got much insight character foreshadowing would die . I sure could done , , say , Mina flip end , I think would least felt strange .

Instead brings world never age , never get sick , never die long stay away Van Helsing , suffocatingly conservative values Victorian society n't really apply anymore . Obviously going strike chord people 're going start thinking maybe Dracula n't bad maybe VanHelsing mind buisness . And start getting increasingly charming charismatic Draculas .

18262,I n't know people hard Keanu one . That whole film parfait bad ideas worse accents . Every single creative choice director/screenwriter made film completely wrong . All characterizations film kilter . Lucy boisterous tramp . Goldaming smug jerk . Seward clutzy doofus . I n't even know start Mina . Van Helsing know-it-all dick . Dracula completely lacked semblance cold subtlety . Tom Waits ' portrayal Renfield pretty good though . Do n't even get started tacky early nineties stylistic crap .

18290,"What I found novels early genre compared horror today today horror ( especially movies ) seem shock value . Maybe fact people seen everything , much shocks people anymore , gore cheap scares , etc . But I like going back classic horror people often wonder made things like Dracula Frankenstein horror , truly scary unnerves . It scarier basic level cheap scares lasting . It idea gets skin stays , essentially haunting . That real haunting , offered us theaters today . Shelley got . Poe got . Stoker got . An example I always use I try explain people Frankenstein . Spoilers ! read . Think back Victor Frankenstein explains describes pretty great detail raised childhood Elizabeth brother sister . She IS sister , albeit adopted . They grow accepted marry ; betrothal sorts . After monster feels betrayed essentially maker father , explicitly tells Victor wedding night . Then , knowing reminded monster , instead something warning Elizabeth , tells something important discuss THE NIGHT AFTER THE WEDDING . The night AFTER KNOWS monster going something . All stem something either consciously subconsciously want go thorough wedding . Why ? Well happens wedding night ? Consummation wedding . Everyone reading sibling , one thing right : real quick , close eyes imagine sibling sex . Could n't , could ? BECAUSE THAT IS HORROR . I would argue novels like still absolutely horrific contemporary writers readers filmmakers everything , ideas still basically horrifying , matter attention spans . I think people used shock value might bored authors , shame . ",1
18295,"I took Horror film fiction class , two works heart content , horror genres , mediums , focus type aspect vampirism monstrosity . The Victorian Era especially gave rise real fear animal vampire monster within . Works like Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde , Jane Eyre , even Barie Peter Pan saw cultures near obsession concept . This ties animal studies well . So many connections drawn fears non-humans human animals related . Very cool stuff .

Godwin abolitionist believed equality ; thought slave trade evil , Black people human beings equal rights , wrote stories journalism slave trade . Mary Wollstonecraft shared beliefs , also feminist ; wrote A Vindication Rights Woman . Mary Wollstonecraft died Mary Shelley young , mother writing influenced .

18710,"In 1981 nonfiction book * Danse Macabre * , Stephen King discussed Frankenstein length . Regarding moment story , King unsurprisingly made salient point : > At length , Victor agrees , actually make woman . He accomplishes second act creation desolate island Orkney chain , pages Mary Shelley creates intensity mood atmosphere nearly rivals creation original . Doubts assail Frankenstein moments imbue creature life . He images world desolated pair . Even worse , imagines hideous Adam Eve entire race monsters . A child times , Shelley apparently never considered idea man capable creating life moldering spare parts , would child play create woman without capacity conceiving child . If readers fiction n't read * Danse Macabre * , I think really , least give look . I lost count times I re-read , special best way . When King really gets rolling subject matter ( Chapter III ) , lovingly talks - length - three special novels achieved kind immortality : * Frankenstein * , * Dracula * , * Strange Case Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde * . He spends rest book talking horror radio ( remember , written 1981 ) , television , movies , course , novels . Given early career wrote , given forty-one years flown since ( horror content forty-one years would entail ) I wish go back another version * Danse Macabre * scratch . Lol !

In version Elizabeth cousin , rewrite SO much creepier Victor marrying cousin , Frankensteins save poverty ( several siblings ) helpful taking living , poor parents many mouths feed ; save angelic looking blond pretty poor , groom marry Victor age like 7 . Elizabeth good person , obsession beauty clearly satirized novel . There religious mythic undertones allusions Frankenstein , notion beauty = goodness really n't supported theme . Rather , Mary uses criticize society . One possible theme Victor hubris , brought playing God fair ways ( though read novel much think welcomed educated Creature , would good , course would n't make welcomed society ) .

The monster victim one internet theories , sort like Ron Paul Harry Potter actually playing make believe stairs whole time , fun people certain age n't really make sense . People buy self-serving perspective killed half dozen people ultimately Shelley showing shitty self-justifying monster . It dumb brute kills . It , someone rich interior life , kills people really bad reasons . But since people read high school n't sophistication disagree novel viewpoint , even one author dying reader disagree . It sort like reading Nabokov Lolita going : H. H. n't bad guy ! Sure molests little girl , actually victim : ask ! Of course fun argue classroom : 'is H.H . actually bad guy ? ' To Nabokov , probably . But Shelley answer definitely yes got simply ignore lot book come another conclusion . There probably also element following : since n't teach civics teachers smuggle ways , like English class , know students n't really reading closely desire teach certain values coincidentally surrounding great works literature . So monster importance becomes easy way shoe horn classic civic lessons bad prejudice ignorance , though really little book either concepts , naturally leads monster becoming 'victim ' today nomenclature . I promise commentators taking students side : re-read book little older , little wiser , little well-read portion book got tear-jerking high school poor Frankenstein monster going come lot less convincing lot heavy-handed . It like reading Wells ' * Time Machine * . First read high school pretty good sci-fi thriller . Read little later painfully obvious commentary capitalism . Similarly , Shelley showing us humanity squared twice violent , twice self-serving half convincing . The whole ending book monster burns alive North Pole probably one least compelling parts book moralizing Shelley : whatever possibility Shelley 'showing us facts ' gone instead get author flatly informing us monster dude bad realizes pathetic . Like great Victorian England morality cliche , kill much victim even realizes definitely n't .

19046,"Frankenstein great novel anyone anyone generation , really . It almost crazy far reaching . It ranges everywhere dangers scientific achevment without considering ethical complications , paternal abandonment . If really think , Victor deadbeat father The Monster bastard child refuses take responsibility . ",1
19047,"In one way I find Frankenstein comforting . It shows mildly depressing loneliness life n't modern thing . That something humanity faced long time . The people past felt alone , okay well . Being outcast n't result technology isolating us one another , media reporting harshness world . A student university 1818 could feel alone , n't different student university 2016 . Isolation n't invention 21st century . In another way completely depressing . Because fundamental way n't changed since 1818 . Despite modern science understanding still inside . We still face fail meet expectations challenges . Despite instantaneous , global communication easily accessed repository knowledge many us still incredibly alone . ",1
19048,"I really like novel many reasons given others . Something one yet mentioned subtitle ; The Modern Prometheus . Shelly n't invent phrase ; Kant previously dubbed Benjamin Franklin Prometheus modern times electricity experiments . Just original Prometheus created man gave ability survive Victor created new man new fire , electricity . The story crime punishment Prometheus Bound ( probably Aeschylus ) continued release captivity Prometheus Unbound written Mary Shelly lover later husband Percy Shelly almost certainly works Shelly wrote Frankenstein . The Promethean analogy runs throughout story . Page one sailor writes sister country eternal light sun forever visible . Victor describes moment knew would work sudden light brilliant wondrous . The monster first sensation light pressed upon nerves ' . It end Victor borne away waves lost darkness . ",1
19050,"I heavily studied novel well author , Mary Shelley , . It absolutely applicable day age terms us understand neither reason romanticism stand alone without . The authors father critic enlightenment felt reason alone could n't fully provide need humanity . Dr. Frankenstein created creature , also known demon . Frankenstein creation creator . Frankenstein galvanized , brought life , immediately abandoned dire consequences creature well scientist . Not commentary ethics science nowadays also good example need consider emotional ramifications rational utilitarian acts . It also interesting feminist undertones , entirely destroying dismembering female counterpart . And story behind writing quite interesting . The author , Percy Shelley Lord Byron ghost story writing competition spending time together cabin . The novel released without authors name , assumed lovers writing could 18-year-old girl written controversial novel famous ? The figure Frankenstein later used demonize liberals , Mary Shelley father quite radical . ",1
19051,"Frankenstein speak humanity forever many reasons . The idea , outcast society , treat react reverberates modern cultures : lower class , poor , immigrants , minorities , etc . The idea two monsters also fascinating : http : //www.utm.utoronto.ca/~dwhite/101/44.htm . And , even though meant high schoolers , http : //www.shmoop.com/frankenstein/ interesting things say well .

19052,"In mind chief ingredient lost every single adaptation book . While theme science run amok told retold ( I read fascinating essay college positing Jurassic Park update Frankenstein myth ) , critical theme nearly always discarded . My hunch : easy make mad scientist bad guy presented something . That , many people Shelley time galvanists even scientists us present day geneticists . We perceive operate outside realms understand threatening anyway , frequently exercise degree control things greatly control . But 're less likely heap fear upon act cruelty rejection us engages point . To condemn Frankenstein casual cruelty condemn us . To condemn Frankenstein toying laws nature condemn . That latter myth become integral retellings story former ignored . As Robert Sawyer agent told : lot money made telling people afraid science . There little made confronting people consequences actions . ",1
19055,"Frankenstein largely rejection physical imperfection/deformity . The Monster demonstrates beautiful , sensitive , intelligent nature * enraged brutal mistreatment alienation due appearance . Even De Lacey , * blind * man , empathizes strongly Monster , yet shuns attacks upon learning hideousness . I find modern relevance , sure . ",1
19057,"Frankenstein timeless . In addition mention , responsibility courage , failure either lead disaster . It really warning playing God , per se , rather creating courage take responsibility creating . Many us create children . All lessons apply . ",1
19058,"An awesome novel survived test time . Written 1800s , Frankenstein covers issues science , religion , humanity . Shelley living middle industrial revolution , scientist , almost visionary comes predicting potentials science . The consequences dire consider carefully . In case science created living conscience . The beast outcast human world , quite ready . As response rejection experiecnes multiple times , monster turns bitter vengeful . He originally sought love place world . No one could offer , killed . In end , Victor beast eternal struggle , leaving us somewhere Arctic . Makes want read book , paradise lost . ",1
19059,"I read Frankenstein first time late last year loved ! It classic timeless tale I think always relevance . It easy reader relate Frank creation , really forces us examine exactly view treat others around us . Personally I read religious mindset , opened mind relation man , God , souls . How like old man faced person like monster , however reality responses usually fear , hatred , and/or dread ",1
19060,"Definitely relatable current times , especially given current feminist movements . I sure woman author would perceived time , I believe early 1800s ? Or people would even cared . She could definitely role model female activists currently . Although I sure intention book , social commentary simply story . I never like assume authors intentions , story used tool look progression science current times . Especially dealing ethics moral responsibility . If goal Mary Shelley provide story provoke thoughts morals ethics , right . If look sense , story , pop culture shows direct reflection Mary Shelley could trying explain . Children stories , movies TV show Frankenstein creation horrific monster seems opposite book trying say . What modern issues make think ? ",1

For instance , seems good fantasy sci-fi story , ideally , ONE premise counterfactual ( e.g . scientist create life laboratory ) , premise established early story , rest story realistic possible , seem flow naturally logically premise . Well , things happened * Frankenstein * thinking would never happen , nothing premise . Does make sense ? ",0
19358,"I really think Frankenstein monster n't bad . Victor Frankenstein main culprit since tried perform experiment things got messed , kept blaming monster . The monster wanted nice , tried help people people n't respond way . His helpless situation ruined finer side character could eventually developed treated kindness . ",1
19360,"My love novel also affected consideration Shelley suffered miscarriage prior writing , claimed story based nightmare waking hideous face bed ( ie . seeing became Frankenstein perspective ) , famously called work hideous progeny .

19367,"The monstrous part Viktor Frankenstein attaining godly power create life immediately ditching responsibility afterwards . He made monster left world without guidance protection could rightly say owed . The Monster feelings rage Frankenstein suffering mankind absent god cruel world . Only Monster power means hold creator accountable . There also themes power struggle father son / creator creation ( i.e . Chronos eating children Oedipus killing dad ) . This constellation fueled first three books Monster finds reads heavily form outlook world : Milton * Paradise Lost * ( It somewhat sympathetically described Lucifer rebelling God thrown heaven ) , Goethe * Sorrows Young Werther * ( A young romantic despares state world general fails find love potential remedy , eventually commits suicide - heavy * Weltschmerz * existence suffering ) Plutarch * Parallel Lives * ( I familiar one ) . & # x200B ; Regarding 2 : Viktor n't refuse .

19368,"It long time since I read book , I explain argument best I . Dr. Frankenstein essentially ambition reanimating human without concern responsibilities inherent task .

He panics sight creation runs away . The first thing Frankenstein monster sees sight father screaming existence . The monster bit odd person , exceptionally intelligent eloquent also mentality severe lack discipline inherent child . And much like child , inherent extreme desire affection , became instantly enamored De Lacey family . Remember Frankenstein monster fucking clue going . He literally birthed middle nowhere , man screams sight , clue , go , anything world . He maintains intellectual capacity whatever brain transferred , memory previous life . The fact large ( presumably ) hideous drove De Lacey family run despite acting friendly possible . Not , \ * afraid\ * mere sight fled home , possibly permanently . If n't drive home would forever denied affection possibly craved , I n't know would . Dr. Frankenstein , moral failings , trapped creation living hell literally birth . So , naturally , Frankenstein pissed , comes across William hears last name , flies rage , might better described temper tantrum young child would .

19369,"I think whole issue word monster may throwing people bit . The novel n't actually ever call anyone monster . It often refers Victor creation creature . Pointing monster really underlying point . I think 're right . Victor flawed ways lot human beings flawed . I actually think central novel saying . Remember second part title originally printed : Frankenstein , Or Modern Prometheus . Prometheus , story God stole fire heavens give humans , usually told nowadays positive thing . Fire arguable man first technological achievement . It gives us light , cooks food , keeps us warm winter . But think negative things also used fires . Burning people alive . Razing whole cities . Slashing rainforests . Perhaps Zeus right mad arrogant naïve Prometheus . And fires n't even always used outright destruction . Think gender reveal parties accidentally started huge wildfires American west . Those terrible results irresponsible use fire . Frankenstein Modern Prometheus stealing power gods/God mankind never meant . The power create sentient life . Unfortunately , mankind , unlike God , imperfect . Not evil . Not monstrous . Just flawed . But even ordinary run-of-the-mill flaws lead terrible consequences combined great power , matter initial intentions . In case Frankenstein , ambition , unreliability , inability take ownership actions n't uncommon . Most time , nothing terrible would result flaws . But combine power create life , leads death death loves . ",1
19370,"Frankenstein ’ monster , ’ ordinary man . And , I think , real point : ordinary men ’ handle power God . Frankenstein took God ’ power wielded like man would , disastrous effect . It ’ tragedy humanity , doctor individual . ",1
19373,"The creature real monster , ’ hill I ’ ready die . I shocked I finally read book last year : I kept waiting Frankenstein something messed , hear convoluted justification creature murdering child . But ! Victor guilty fleeing shambling inhuman thing , creature became serial killer people treated bad . Could Frankenstein assumed responsibility ? Yes . He acts pretty irresponsibly downright cowardly , ditching years work moment returning check things ages . He ’ one melodramatic Victorian characters seems super irrational modern ol ’ . But defense , way knowing created , feelings , even going survive hours . It ’ like saw creation literal child turned back . He might tried harder work question , I think case absent father overreaching . If anything duty hunt kill creation protect public unknown element . The hubris angle would work better failed trying . I totally accept people different impressions culpability , condemn . I get . But Boy Scout compared creature . The creature vengeful cruel . He got dealt bad hand , seems developed mental moral faculties quickly , nearly quickly decides feelings whims important innocent people ’ lives . He murders kid send message . He lets innocent woman die crime , kills others terrorize Frankenstein . That ’ cartoonishly monstrous . If creature deserves sympathy school shooters . I ’ pass . As classics , population pretends know book dozens times larger population actually reads . Saying Victor real monster another piece folklore gets passes around someone use appear smart . The absurd part probably 100 % people ’ read book would familiar idea monster misunderstood , nothing novel parroting contrarian cleverness . Again , want say victor bad , okay , I see point view . But man creature villain . ",0

I hated felt like weird ye olde excuse Fate Angel Death blame Victor dick . It also felt less epistolary compared Dracula novels style . Then I took gothic lit class college read 1818 version ( Mary original ) revised 1831 edition . Turns , I read 1831 edition previously Mary Shelley revised make less radical , removing quote Paradise Lost symbolism throughout , making clear Victor Frankenstein puppet outside forces . It also expands areas greatly , single sentence Chapter 1 Caroline turning multiple page reflection childhood . Several passages Creatures perspective edited . Victor made sympathetic . The 1818 version , hand , clearly underscores decisions Victor made . He significant freewill choose deviate course . On one hand , makes frustrating , also believable character . Victor shitty person , audience , understand slightly aware fact making , opinion , tolerable . In version , Creature sympathetic .

19481,"actually , I possibly person n't hate Frankenstein character , I could go far say I sympathize . He often criticized douchebag accepting responsibility consequences created , I find irresponsibility inexcusable , understandable ( even relatable ) motivated fundamental moral fault . His motive self-centered , sure , actions reflection inability escape logical hierarchy built ( Ti-Si loop ) . His life basically constant confirmation ideals part reality rather active effort ignore . He basically surrounded obvious signs wrongdoings , yet I feel overwhelmed grief , pain , incapacity accept anything outside strict logical hierarchy built ( idealism also something Creature suffers , learns change ) . These feelings integral part human experience , though dark side . I guess I trying get instead seeing black-and-white scenario characters like Frankenstein , try understand behave certain way help people isolation rather isolating . ",1

In another audio-analysis Spotify , professor noticed relationship oppressed people creature , forced hiding ignorant population denied basic dignities .

I believe I seen classic Universal movies I read book , I knew book different , parents read told .

Frankenstein Unbound sparked creativity , made write 30-page version original story . I never published anywhere , close people read . ",1
19509,"The book awesome , especially given context how/when written . The original adaptations came along monster movies - movies general - getting hugely popular lost lot complex characterization sake thrills/drama/scares . I judging , times . If get chance , read monster books 19th century ultimately turned movies mid-20th century ( e , g . The Strange Case Dr. Jekyl Mr. Hyde , Dracula , etc . ) There lot things lost translation book film . I guess really different today . The Turn Screw faithfully adapted 20th century times , I always found one boring . In Frankenstein case , really lost turned monster embittered , suffering , lamenting , tortured soul confused , lumbering , child-like monster . And change Dr. Frankenstein unempathetic , egomaniacal a-hole god complex misunderstood scientist struggles manage resurrected man-child . I think best movie adaptation one early 1990s Robert DeNiro Kenneth Branaugh , though cast wrong . It pretty loyal book spirit complexity character . Alternatively , Frankenstein monster character Penny Dreadful series pretty nice adaptation character .... series , much , course . ",1

He calls future wife sister . She cousin , sister , wife . That odd even time period . It also death mother drives toward breaking point . 2 . He profoundly self centered way makes seem completely inhuman . During trial Justine says , The tortures accused equal mine . This poor girl put trial murder n't commit in-fact less guilty occurring , yet believes suffering ? He get past ego experience empathy . He monster commits actions monster would , consistently acts way human . ",1
19603,"As someone studying Frankenstein College , I may able help . Monster bit overstatement I think Shelley definitely wanted us sympathise monster , similar Milton Satan Paradise Lost . Personally , main reason I believe Frankenstein portrayed negatively Shelley femenist views . He disregarded Elizabeth , destroyed female monster abandoned creature , often considered symbolic women whole . Because , suffer shown negatively . This said , fairly morally ambiguous novel . When consider use frame narratives , ties three main characters together n't much difference Frankenstein creature ",1
19604,"Ok , two ways Mary Shelley defines morality novel . Victor Frankenstein punished , bad science bad faith ? Does play God take responsibility experiments ? Both plausible argued thoroughly . Victor creates life , something reserved God , tampering morality , creates malicious creature . BUT first created , could n't stand uncanny horror , ignored . FOR SEVERAL MONTHS . Imagine caring baby given birth . How affect child grows ? Look Feral Children examples . If Victor good scientist , would taken responsibility creation beginning raised better , since n't , creature actions partially Victor fault . This makes monster . There third definition morality novel people miss . The creature refers Victor Author least two occasions . The creature , manner , allegory Novel , Victor author . Mary Shelley first wrote novel scare freinds , authors , plausible continued motif Frankenstein . The creature roaming world different one releases novel . It meanders , forever changing lives touches . For better , worse . It becomes entity outside author control . People interpret ignore reimagine without author presence correct . ",1
19605,"Victor Frankenstein absolutely tragic character , 're right suggest view actions lens , means makes innocent .

19619,"That intelligent interpretation , definitely possible young Mary Shelley worked novel , especially keeping company well-read educated Romantic artists .

Keep mind though , Mary Shelley mother , Mary Wollstonecraft ( accomplished writer , see * A Vindication Rights Women * ) died childbirth ; Mary Shelley n't lose mother , actively ( though unintentionally ) responsible death . Her father , William Godwin , cast remarried , perhaps blaming Mary death mother , perhaps never truly forgiving , perhaps never truly forgiving part loss .

19650,"Hi ! I think much creature innocent , two common misconceptions novel : first , creature named Frankenstein ( clearly ) ; second , Frankenstein victim ( clearly ) . There different types readings make novel , way interpreted class last semester : 1 . Victor always blaming others responsibility . He says dad taught better , would n't interested science guys actually led experiments . He blames creature horrible ( thus rejects ) , one made . 2 . He save Justine . He suspects creature guilty murder brother , easily explain something end ( least Justine , appease guilt ) , remains mum . Not condemning death ( assumes jury find innocent ) , also lets die believen guilty . 3 . Victor creates creature without giving second thought . His megalomania gets best thinks Man God , believes source life . Yet concern looks creature ( aiming make someone like Chris Hemsworth , , know , least someone hideous ) . And second creature created , Victor shuns rejects . The creature , highly intelligent capable acquiring knowledge , tormented looks - one sees ever accept due hidesousness born . This leads constant rejection , violence solitude . I justifying creature murders , conscious Victor brother Elizabeth , first , unaware ( like little girl drowning ) , accident . And Elizabeth . Victor self-centered n't contemplate possibility sharing truth woman supposed partner , narcissism selfishness lead death . If told truth , could sought form help would least aware try avoid creature . So , overall , I think issue creature becomes violent murderer way created due rejection society upon , based entirely physical appearance , yet Victor bigger a-hole , never considers consequences actions , never considers coming clean peers ( thinks wo n't believed shrugs idea ) , alerting police , letting Elizabeth know , , know , trying play God .

19651,"I also recently finished book although I appreciate review , I disagree innocence paint Frankenstein character . The flippancy Frankenstein rejects disregards creation , even time creation creature helpless alone , implicates responsibility circumstances proceed . You say father responsible actions child - considered situation story father child , rather father monster ? Certainly , monster evil , especially fully sapient understanding crimes . However , someone else said , monster actions someone desperate , Frankenstein actions someone selfish egotistical . Frankenstein gambles people lives entire book - haphazardly risking innocent friend life much better actively taking life ? I think discussion really makes novel fascinating - really provokes thoughts reader assesses responsibility , reader perceived victim , reader determines accountability someone based circumstances led committing act . In opinion , parties guilty , Frankenstein primarily responsible igniting flame , ignoring every aspect human nature ( perceives creation lacking human nature - would situation avoided treated monster human ? Instead gives mental ability human , denies humanity , shuns acting human nature faced desperation solitude ) , failing take responsibility actions . Edit : thinking , even worse I initially thought . The novel written Frankenstein protagonist . And even still , feel holds responsibility actions . Yet , author , writing events perceives . This creates massive bias us viewing monster monster , wretched creature . So perceive characterize monster evil Frankenstein victim . However , time hear monster tale story cabin , empathize understand human . Then go back Frankenstein perspective , removing monster narratives , abandoning feelings , heightening concept evil . Ask - would perception right wrong change entire narrative written monster perspective , rather Frankenstein ? ",1

19875,"In opinion , Frankenstein novel original interesting central idea , terribly badly written point view plot structure . You mention ending , I agree hugely unsatisfying .

His feelings towards creator seem magically reverse moment learns death . Of course shock hearing someone death change person feelings .

19885,"While sure people responded book , using real struggles/innovations time put different light [ source ] ( https : //www.ukessays.com/essays/english-literature/the-historical-context-of-frankenstein-english-literature-essay.php ) The monster symbolism birth science—an acquisition intellectual power beyond common learning . “ At first I started back , unable believe indeed I reflected mirror ; I became fully convinced I reality monster I , I filled bitterest sensations despondence mortification ( Shelley 112 ) . ” This statement Victor ’ creature signifies extreme power knowledge beyond human thoughts . During period 19th century science emerged profession . It becomes one distinct points learning said era . It means Shelley aware capability science create different entities . Science one significant points novel establishes conflict story . When monster perceives face mirror , Shelley conveys authority science human existence power create abnormal creatures—beyond expectation . Aside birth science , Shelley also discusses representation women society within novel . “ At one time I considered whether I declare guilty suffer penalty law , less innocent poor Justine ( Shelley 185 ) . ” This statement Victor encompasses guilt towards Justine . He knows woman murder—it creature , weak character , lets Justine suffer . This idea depiction women status society . During period 19th century Shelley writes novel , women voice culture . They remain weak , unprivileged , servants men . Using character Justine innocent , weak , poor woman , Victor tends utilize surpass sins . It happens without knowledge Justine know situation within midst . Therefore , Justine ’ case composition 19th century history wherein women objects society treated individuals . Shelley ’ novel also construction social enlightenment 19th century civilization . This Fred Randel ( 2003 ) believes article entitled “ The Political Geography Horror Mary Shelley ’ Frankenstein. ” “ Victor resembles European intellectuals flirted actively promoted radical ideas home , aghast overseas colonies chose apply Enlightenment notions human rights condition ( Randel 469 ) . ” Randel states Victor ’ character signification social enlightenment acts determination unleash secrets physical life . It means Victor tries deconstruct traditional perspectives people towards existence humans . Shelley uses Victor ’ character encompass idea enlightenment towards birth science . Since science also form physical intellectual enlightenment , novel produces point history talks non-traditional structure civilization . Lastly , Shelley describes concept Marxism novel structure Victor ’ creature . According Diana Reese ( 2006 ) article entitled “ A Troubled Legacy : Mary Shelley ’ Frankenstein Inheritance Human Rights , ” “ Victor Frankenstein hear justice monster ’ claim ( ideal citizen ) grant corollary rights man : protection necessities life . In “ series , ” unfinished citizen , daemon comes figure something akin “ unreal universality ” rights-bearer Karl Marx ’ analysis Declaration Rights Man Citizen. ” ( Reese 65 ) When monster states story , Victor perceives human thoughts monster physical appearance hinders become real human . The concept Marxism emerges point creature called “ unfinished citizen ” due appearance . Therefore , could obtain privileges rights human beings . This scenario encompasses history society 19th century wherein people equal due physical appearance . The civilization era degrading Shelley trying convey people perceive beauty humanness person physical appearance—not heart , mind , soul . In conclusion , said Frankenstein depicts historical context 19th century different portions—social class , knowledge , enlightenment . Shelley unleashes fact Frankenstein simple story horror , narration social issues period 19th century—the period revolution , knowledge growth , social awareness . Therefore , history reflects throughout novel unravels life beyond conventional . ",1

It utilises frame narrative ( Walton recounting Frankenstein , recounts creature ) unreliable narrator . Victor often verbose melodramatic style deliberate attempt convince Walton innocence abdicate responsibility creature crimes . But look closely see Shelley n't want us sympathise Victor . For example , ehile Justine awaits execution crime n't commit , narrative point revolves entirely around Victor sense dread fear creature . He constantly begs listener/reader ( remember Walton , due frame narrative ) sympathise internal grief struggle stage , simultaneously making Justine sacrifice . In short , megalomania action . Another good example creature born . It held hand - seemingly detain . We know creature narrative though lie - held hand help , hindrance .

The whole frame story artic explorer guy rescuing Frankenstein pretty much never heard like wtf I felt majority cast repetitive , flat 2D exception Frankenstein monster . Have read Dracula ? Same fucking deal . So annoying . But yah , I think characters ( except monster Frank ) pretty much used tropes . Considering Mary Shelley ( ! ) scandalous affair Percy , arguably responsible suicide Percy first wife Harriet indirectly linked another suicide ( half sister Mary , I think ? ) , I always thought monster either Mary percy . And Frankenstein Dad society . knows Was n't really sure Frankenstein never told anyone creation , full pride and/or shame ? To create monster , Frankenstein became grave robber , desecrator corpses crime modern times , certainly crime back , legal one moral one . also , monster looked exactly like , something patched together dismembered body parts corpses . maybe Frankenstein achieved something amazing scientifically , means repulsive violated way many fundamental human moralities able show ( felt , I think lol ) . Also Frankenstein behaving way people near assuming lost losing mind . remember also sick long time fever , fever associated time delirium etc . The real story monster incredible Frankenstein reasons told truth , people would believe mad/crazy . And tbf , point. although feel could written better people like speculate alternative authorships Frankenstein reasoning goes work genius could possibly written 19 year old girl . Germain Greer points inherent misogynism sexism behind claims , goes point book pretty badly written , technical perspective . So 're good company ! ",0

Then I realized Mary Shelley sort genius exactly story Adam Eve , replicated man science . A man science would make different choice God , would see flawed creation ( humans ) mistake . Thinking conundrum ( humans mistake imperfect image creator ) , I reread entire book analytical eye ( counterpoint Milton Paradise Lost ) .

I could wrong regard , Frankenstein idea monster procreating spreading undead curse , I think bit stretch . ",0
19925,"My point exactly : layered text . You approach various directions Milton text ( Victor like Milton Satan , thinking abilities reserved God , creature like Milton Satan , creature revenges upon maker ruins endeavors ) , story Prometheus ( Victor steals power/might/knowledge gods ) , Plato Theory Forms . You examine theme technology displacing man work , theme knowledge/education , place role women motherhood ( * conspicuous lack suggest overlooked author part ; well , certainly treated explicitly , subtext work , IMO ; Victor also cutting mother procreation equation , refuses share creation producing child regular way . He refuses build female creature create others , * ) , etc . You get lot book , n't sucker thinking horror story , meant entertain reflect upon time . Lots people , pick book , think know 're going getting ( first SF-horror novel , similar popular idea Frankenstein monster , complete bolts stitches ) idea profundity work .

20263,"What I always liked * The Shining * contrast many novels controlled . It tightly focused intense . He takes couple characters really one primary character isolates far away everybody everything . It extremely introspective ruminative novel sets apart many others suffer I always think 'cast thousands ' issue . Some novels seem depend upon big , big supporting cast folks prop main story certain sameness obtains bit . * The Shining * really Jack demons makes feel tightly wound , I like . As far Kubrick adaptation concerned common knowledge King care much made displeasure clear . But thing Stephen King adaptation much Stanley Kubrick film , Kubrick gives interpretation King novel re-imagining King novel certainly kind mirror image . ",1
20264,"My advice watching Kubrick ’ * The Shining * first time : - Watch biggest screen possible good sound system . - Accept almost nothing King ’ book . Seriously , besides character names basic plot points , two completely separate products . King hated Kubrick ’ adaptation , understandable film deviated almost every way book , including character developments major themes . That said , movie absolute masterpiece , visually groundbreaking disturbing layered . Kubrick literal genius ( IQ 200 ) operating singular creative level . The famous scenes movie even book . There whole subculture people nothing analyze movie come thematic conspiracies based little hints easter eggs . It ’ trip . Both book movie great different reasons .

The book Pet Semetery also much depth movie ( ’ see re-make , heard ’ awful ) .

20307,The movie Doctor Sleep really good . It definitely differs book fits sequel Shining movie good . ,1
20308,"I recently saw Doctor Sleep movie managed remain pretty damn faithful book , changes make mesh film version . My biggest complaints left Wendy flashbacks , Abra grandmother omitted entirely , fucking sucked . That said , reason , climax much different due change books hotel still existing rather blown . What actually narratively interesting , circles back around give us meta callback ending original Shining book , I found satisfying . If dislike difference Shining book movie , Doctor Sleep movie actually goes long way correcting wrongs fixing little bit . Other climax omission grandmother though ? The film almost scene scene book . It worth watch , * especially * n't care changes original film . ",1
20310,"It ’ funny I always heard terrible King writing women . Having grown watching The Shining , I like sure , must useless . Then one day I decided read ( first King book ) I blown away Wendy book . She ’ intelligent , caring , brave , fighting tooth nail family . To day , I ’ bring rewatch film . ",1
20313,"I ’ say The Shining book best version , Doctor Sleep movie best version . Sounds odd , doctor sleep movie improved much compared book ",1
20314,"Lol I n't say best book time ; many books better The Shining . But personally , I love , book memories I associate . ",1
20316,"Maybe , movie features four characters , character study , ’ awful . Danny stereotypical young boy , stereotypical young boy interests , actual personality . The book sub plot imaginary friend turned named Danny ’ middle name extension psyche dealing trauma , internal conflict , absent movie . Danny ’ mother ( whose name I ’ even recall without looking ) shrill , annoying , horse faced woman contributes literally nothing towards movie victim hood , completely missing effects towards husband son book . Halloran caricature black man , introducing concepts audience never expanded upon , dies moment tries anything story expository lore . In book , Halloran took role mentor extremely useful towards keeping Danny alive forces evil . In movie , entirely worthless towards characters overarching plot . The worst , however , Jack . Jack Torrence book tragic figure . A man torn temper control , addiction overcome , resentment yet actually address . As character book , Jack Torrence message reader , sort “ grace god go I ” . At end story , temptations Overlook ’ malevolent spirit entity , Jack succumbs inner demons cast body , used puppet slay family . Jack book dead long Overlook blew , throughout story ending alluded references faulty boiler . In movie , Jack goes insane real explored reason . He ’ asshole psychopath decides torment terrify ’ * * bored * * ! His death end story pointless , murder Halloran . In end , nothing gained , spooky ghost story whose elements never add anything Cabin Fever hallucinations . It ’ themes opposite . The movie inconsistent plot , one dimensional characters , shallow morals . It visually striking , sound set designs excellent , ’ much positive things I say . Like I said , Stanley Kubrick brilliant artist . Several scenes The Shining , like several scenes movies , particular 2001 : A Space Odyssey , art motion . But script bad , acting sub par , story disappointing . Kubrick may great artist , shitty storyteller . ",0
20317,"That ’ point , though . If The Shining one best examples horror movie good , ’ scathing indictment horror movies , , objectively , good movie . It poorly constructed , poorly written , poorly acted . As far I tell , sole reason The Shining hailed masterpiece horror movies ( admittedly ) fantastic cinematography . That ’ . ",0
20321,"Honestly , I dislike King shift writing style I purposely n't read Dr Sleep I n't want ruin The Shining . ",0
20322,"I get . I seen movie many times always enjoyed , I picked book entirely different experience I understand exactly gets flack vast departure . That said , I learned years appreciate adaptations enjoy different interpretations source material , judge merits . Game Thrones departed greatly source material still good , went shitter , The Mist took King novella turned something even better original . In case The Shining , yeah , movie resembles book broadest strokes , I still appreciate alternate take story , albeit inferior one . Doctor Sleep feels like double-duty continuation band-aid original film . It sticks source material * * closely , also throwing callbacks film version acting continuation , adapting accommodate changes original film , manages repair damage , far . What missed climax original film get taste Doctor Sleep , fans book greatly appreciate cap things , even changes ending drastically . I still prefer book , Doctor Sleep movie comes across sort apology fans books got cheated , I genuinely loved . ",1
20325,"Except I . I judging movie standards movie . As far cinematic structure concerned , The Shining terrible movie . It introduces plot elements later forgotten abandoned , introduces characters end mattering way set , brings interesting concepts existence supernatural fails expound upon explore , features characters without discernible character arc motivations beyond surface level . I * * * * criticizing movie The Shining bad book . I criticizing bad movie . ",0
20326,"You misunderstand nature criticism Shining movie . I criticizing differences book . In fact , I saw movie I read book , hated first viewing . The movie bad merits , ’ popularity always baffling . It ’ poorly written , featuring red herrings , audience based misdirection , useless additions . It adds elements explain fit together , payoff unsatisfying pointlessness . It follows four characters , three portrayed untalented actors , fourth clearly time life playing unrepentant , irredeemable jackass acts like cartoonish villain third act reasons insufficiently explored . From narrative perspective , The Shining simply bad movie . It ’ great atmospheric perspective , good atmosphere good movie make . That book good makes hate movie , even judged stand-alone movie ’ good . ",0
20328,"In fairness , The Shining infamous fact Stanley Kubrick outright tortured Shelley Duvall production . He made dozens dozens takes back back screaming allowing rest take break . He vision Wendy different book version pushed ensure got captured film . Shelley Duvall accomplished capable actress , appearance annoying n't due Duvall , rather Kubrick wanted portray . Regardless , even retooled specifically annoying film version compared quiet yet determined nature book , reinforces fact Kubrick pushed Jack basically hate family jump , rather good guy dark past making monumental effort better loves much . Movie Jack shows inclination , one could easily imagine different set circumstances , might finished book , got published instantly dumped Wendy Danny curb somewhere go lines hookers ass cared little .

20331,"I also fully agree movie way deeper book . Stephen king wrote story haunted hotel . Kubrick trying directly adapt Shining , rather use vehicle explore themes generational trauma , atrocities committed humanity decades , genocide familial abuse . I saying book n't explore things well , much less abstract thought provoking Kubrick movie n't exploring human condition way Kubrick . I feel like 're looking movie lens book trying make sense movie book I believe wrong way looking . Kubrick intention directly adapting novel included several specific details show audience . I think look movie book two completely different entities valued separately different reasons . Personally movie one favorites time incredibly well Kubrick uses elements book stripped original intent create new story , well create allegories explore themes historical atrocities continue time , way beyond surface level events happened overlook . I think mistaking shallowness trying view movie lens book never going work . The movie actually like , super notorious amount deeper meaning layered far I understand book inspire even close kind analysis movie . The book attempted character study , movie never attempted even second story Kubrick trying tell . ",1
20332,"I n't really want get argument Shining one favorite movies , I n't top head years since I seen . Appeals popularity n't invalidate argument . You saying Shining objectively bad counteracted people study movie say objectively good . Perhaps different people look different things attribute different value thing . Maybe think makes movie bad something I care think makes book good something I n't care . Despite knowing movie heart , I try address points . The Shining irrelevant movie ? Do n't think matters , adds mysticism universe lends strength supernatural elements movie . Danny superfluous story ? Could n't care less , small child dealing things n't understand little control . The supernatural elements scary sake scary ? Do agree . When Wendy sees dog giving blowjob waiter , scary sake scary . Narrative explanation n't explicit exist also need exist . Halloran red herring another thing I n't think matters . It emphasizes point Wendy Danny alone must deal monster pursuing . Have seen The Shining mini-series directed Stephen King ? Do think better movie ? The movie much open ended leaving things explained make much memorable valuable media , opinion . ",1

20335,"I ’ really confused argument . You ’ like fifth person argue I ’ looking movie perspective book . I assure , I . Firstly , I saw movie reading book , I hated first viewing cinematic narrative flaws apparent even . The Shining entirely irrelevant plot movie , ghosts various supernatural apparitions ever tied hallucinations otherwise made exploration human condition . That ’ argument ’ hold . The movie loaded scary things sake scary , detracts potential message exploration generational trauma . This reeks post hoc rationalization , rather judging content merits , judging content based messages * * * * applied . That ’ far objective get . I criticizing movie close objective reasons I manage . For example , character Halloran , cinematically , red herring . He introduced audience another person special quality Danny . Never movie nature Shining explored , intentionally kept vague . Through The Shining , Danny able receive visions , though visions fail change anything sequence events , explore Danny father individuals . Narratively , white noise . Danny able use The Shining call help Halloran third act . Halloran comes call , demonstrating truth usefulness phenomenon . Only untrue , Halloran gets slaughtered ten seconds entering hotel . Had scenes Danny calling Halloran answering cut movie , plot would unchanged . That Danny mother stole dead man ’ snow speeder escape almost irrelevant given happened last seconds film escape still ambiguous ( prior release Doctor Sleep , anyway ) . Cinematically , movie poorly constructed . The ideas muddled themes unclear . The idea honestly argue movie ’ haunted hotel given presence literal ghosts little silly . Kubrick ’ commit supernatural elements used purely atmosphere . Which bad filmmaking . ",0
20336,"I mean , I loved ending novel immensely Danny unleashing ghosts everyone siccing Abra grandmother particular Rose . That powerful . The Hotel need n't involved impactful Danny finds measure closure personal ( real ) demons also paving path forward better life place demons born . That said , I give full marks film taking original ending The Shining recasting Danny tragic figure subsumed evil Overlook forced chase someone loves wants desperately hurt place goes boiler explosion , exactly like original . It much darker ending , I perfectly okay , great merit . The movie gives darker bent , well adapting one best parts original book got gutted terms impact original film , book tells tale man rough go life beginning returning place troubles began * literally * vanquishing demons move towards brighter tomorrow . The film version rights wrong original adaptation delivers feelings concepts original , book provides triumphant showdown evil . I enjoy , though different reasons , I quite enjoy two different takes story . I still think one better , n't make either bad , different . ",1
20337,"I ’ admitted multiple occasions cinematography set/sound design movie incredible . I ’ denying . The entire draw point movie book phenomenal atmosphere Kubrick managers cultivate .

20338,"I say objective things I care . The technical details objective get also agree 're amazing . They dismissed , present entire movie take center stage many movie points .

I argue n't King focus , writing good enough convey wants . ",1
20339,"I think appreciate two separate entities . The Shining favorite King novel , I also love movie . The movie excels giving feeling dread , well creepy atmosphere course acting make film classic . With said , I see King upset adapted . I almost ’ even think story . ",1
20340,Alternative take : Great movie adaptions achieved wise confident changes . I rather watch shining remotely safe 1:1 adaption . Its wonderful reinvention I personally find compelling . There also nothing generic shining . ,1
20341,"I finished reading The Shining recently watched movie first time . I know King disliked movie makes perfect sense I exact issues . The Shining main character flawed clearly loves family , especially son . In movie never even hints loves Danny , one scene says much loves tense Danny actor clearly uncomfortable . The movies honestly different I feel better thing . Reading shining first time ( seen movie except iconic scenes ) I kept expecting see elevator blood scene little girls calling Danny none exists book . The whole last 1/4 unique film , personally helped distance even head . ",1
20342,"This I felt I read The Shining . It n't favorite King book , I totally sympathize feeling like movie erased Jack merits took away lot Wendy agency . I think King hates much , book also personal . To see characters story portrayed made audiences think story written , n't . I n't think adaptations need symmetric source texts , The Shining excellent piece art right . The main problem I movie Stanley Kubrick bad person human level . The psychological abuse cast crew , particularly Shelley Duvall , makes hard love movie . I n't care good film making , Kubrick major prick I think another reason King hated much . It dishonest portrayal characters wrote ( regardless good reinvention ) environment production hostile hell . I totally understand emotions ( King ) , unfortunately I admit film still excellent piece cinema . Fuck Kubrick though ",0
20343,"I know I biased ; movie one favorites . And -is- favorite horror movie , hands . So , grain salt . But think unfair call Kubrick The Shining generic haunted house movie . The slow burn tension , amazing practical effects , feeling off-kilter whole film . Even subtext , may may included , Kubrick may may meant , interesting . I agree movie reflect book well . But , hard translate book visual medium lose something . And know , proof . In 1997 , Stephen King wrote produced TV mini series based novel . He involved pretty much every aspect series , gave us version The Shining visual media product . And dull . It awful . The character development much better . The woman plays Wendy ages better Shelley Duvall ( , opinion , weakest part Kubrick version ) . But remains drawn slightly boring . And look Dr. Sleep . It decent enough novel , movie , thought , messy saccharine . Kubrick notorious cutting source material fit ends . Just look controversy surrounding A Clockwork Orange . But I n't think diminishes merits version Shining . I like think movie distillation King novel , goes long way King recommends storytelling : show , n't tell . ",1
20344,"If Shining generic horror film , horror would better genre . It different slimmer take source material , far generic movie anyway . Hard call horror movie generic first kill comes third act . ",0
20345,"Plenty films strayed far source material , authors embraced . Take Annihilation example . Sounds like The Shining personal work King , never took liking messed . Either way fascinating see filmmakers adapt interpret artists works . In case The Shining , Kubrick created masterpiece . You may like , considered time great many many reasons - funny enough , source material really one . ",1
20346,"I completely understand . I read The Shining first time I 13 immediately fell love . For years number one favorite book , day remains top five . So I finally rented VHS witness controversial masterpiece Kubrick The Shining , I mad ! I could accept crude handling Wendy shrieking helpless pixie . The maze n't interesting . And I n't care Jack thousand yard stare . But I think Danny ghost interactions upset . To bland little importance book much . I n't rewatch Kubrick Shining another 15 years , I reread book countless times . I better able appreciate Kubrick work stand alone entity loosely influenced King book adult . I see art piece cinema . I like impact pop culture overall , twin girls always great meme , n't good book comes telling frightening story madness , ghosts , survival , strange little boy . ",1

20353,"I finished audiobook agree wholeheartedly . I disappointed characters movie . They seemed one dimensional . I went online try find place rent stream miniseries King produced , buy . I spent nights , mentally directing casting The Shining Netflix Hulu series . ( I Ryan Gosling Jake Gyllenhaal Jack Amanda Seyfried Lupita Nyong ' Wendy ) . 10 episodes story justice . ",1
20355,"I honestly love versions story . Which one I like pretty much determined whichever version I experiencing moment . Same Doctor Sleep . Kubrick movie actually one best examples I point I say infidelity source material n't inherently make adaptation bad , fidelity material make adaptation good . I like use The Shining actually another adaptation released 1997 much faithful whole lot worse either prior works . ",1
20356,"I think first sentence way mark begin . Stephen King movie adaptations almost universally critically acclaimed . Carrie , The Shining , Green Mile , fucking SHAWSHANK , Children Corn cult classic , Firestarter , The Mist arguably one unpredictable gut-wrenching endings cinema , Misery . I think big stretch say long history poor adaptations . In fact , regarding film adaptations famous books , I would say King probably best record author whos books adaptions . That said , yes , Shining film leave lot internal monologuing narration . You n't quite get sympathy Jack film appears book . I also think Jack Nicholson portrayal significant part Jack felt like psychopath beginning . It acting style . ",1
20358,Shambolic statement describing shining generic horror movie . It mastery ambiance rising tension/dread . ,1
20359,"I hear . I read The Shining I 20 thought pretty good scary story . I read 15 years later , becoming parent , saddest thing I ever read . The relationship father son betrayal relationship It heart-wrenching . ",1
20360,"In theme , novel Shining nearly ambiguous film . I seen movie half dozen times years ever reading book . The book on-the-nose addiction allegory took level two action . It consume like film I watch . The film full mystery way book . Perhaps book resonates struggled addiction . But , little obvious favorite King . But I definitely see King would take issue adaptation . Kubrick obscures addiction theme instead focuses madness isolation . ",1
20361,"This I feel well . I watched The Shining ever reading book , despite loving horror movies much nothing I put reading book years even discovering love King . When I finally got around giving shot , I thrilled discover much depth story , much better characters , much fleshed-out Shining , much * scarier * I also furious Kubrick totally ruined , * * people liked * * . I hoping Flanagan would retcon little end Doctor Sleep , I guess much pressure given many people primarily knew ( - liked ! ) original story Kubrick film . I understand King hates Kubrick version - definitely adaptations bad least badly received , I ca n't imagine completely aggressively * missed entire point story * way film version The Shining . ",0
20362,"Your opinion , valid , represents misunderstanding difference artistic mediums purpose adaptation , I like respectfully offer counterpoint . First , reading King * Shining * sound . King top genre decades , upon reading something seminal * The Shining * , question . King masterful storyteller , given room explore themes craft characters , * The Shining * clocking 400 500 pages ( depending edition ) , undoubtedly time space craft intricate moving story . However , great books rarely make great films adapted face value . Look works Jules Verne , Mary Shelley , J.R.R . Tolkien , recently , Madeleine L'Engle , Eoin Colfer , Lois Lowry . While relative greatness books debated , fairly universally accepted adaptations thereof ranged disappointing abhorrent . This due inherent differences two media . Both narrative , literature benefit much slower consumption digestion , film use entire audiovisual arsenal get concepts across realtime course hours . That brings us matter adaptation whole . While near 1:1 adaptations attempted past , success ( * Lord Rings * * Harry Potter * films come mind immediate examples close adherence text ) , typically exceptions rule , films get liberal source material often better chance survival . Point case - probably extreme example rampant success beyond original text - * Forrest Gump * . A fair amount viewers idea adaptation , familiar source text strongly abide creative decisions made Roth Zemeckis , citing runaway success . And finally , deem Kubrick * Shining * generic horror movie outright false . Perhaps 're referring film similarities number contemporary ( shallower ) imitators , I like point , far generic horror movies go , Kubrick provided prototype rather following design . Every one Kubrick films represent wild innovation . From ambiguity film conclusion , impeccable attention mise en scene , brutal treatment cast filming , pushed envelope point bursting . The narrative spin towards cyclical violence predestination allowed Kubrick tell largely similar story King novel without overreliance . There significant departures King writings , especially regards lost themes , express purpose delivering Kubrick film King adaptation . In short , King perfectly within rights dismiss Kubrick film visualization novel - phenomenal novel - adaptation , prototype modern horror , * The Shining * nearly unparalleled . It sits atop dozens greatest horror film lists , largely Kubrick ruthless innovation . ",1
20363,Calling The Shining generic horror movie underselling quite bit . Saying poor adaptation one thing deny Kubrick movie good cinema borders ridiculous . ,1
20364,"Yes , I saw film first shocked I read book weirdly sweet ? There much heart love written characters . I really cared characters , heart constantly broke Danny . I think Shining great film , completely different spirit book . ",1
20365,"I recently revisited Shining also read book first time , honestly came dark comedy . Jack immediately reason HATES family , nothing sweet kind , kind comes humorous , like Kubrick deliberately making fun Stephen King book .

King books need mini-series even come close justice . We saw The Stand . Under Dome potential lost steam halfway ( fairness weak story begin ) .

An author required like film version work , especially means much strays far original text . But deny beauty atmosphere Kubrick ’ work , baselessly insult vision , crude point .

Doctor Sleep evoked different kind dread , also horrified terrible ways , True Knot evil monsters I ever read , yet somehow making people , drew conflicting emotions .

The book fractured family still love , isolated evil , haunted hotel uses fractures order steal psychic abilities little boy first terrorizing manipulating father killing . Of two plots I prefer haunted evil hotel human insanity . I hear much human evil world unsurprising find movies , even paired possible supernatural events - idea hunted hotel evil agenda devour soul innocent child terrifying !

The eeriness scrapbook giving history hotel , conversations Danny tony .

Taking empathy films allowed highlight concepts , themes , screenplay , cinematography really powerful way .

20639,"> First , I see notable distinction Jack Torrance beginning movie , Jack Torrance end movie chasing Wendy stairs taking axe bathroom door . Yes ? That book . It takes lot longer + actually makes sense . > Second , Jack exactly picture calm stability beginning book . Within first 15 pages , learn serious anger issues . Before meet Jack , already broken toddler son arm fit rage , beaten shit one students point boy required hospitalization . You 're conflating anger issues psychosis hallucinatory delusion ? Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo K. See , even correct entire concept book revolved around activation house shining , movie cabin fever . > If Jack seems little crazy beginning movie , true source material . The movie barely even resembles book . It one thing say supposed , common argument worth , say actually follow spirit + source author , , know , people read well professionals could create screenplays direct film know could done disagree ? Fine uh The original ending even find body give kid tennis ball . I mean , derp , dream original ending movie 're saying true source ? The movie barely even touches shining , magical negro , wife brained bag doorknobs . Just .

20646,"I n't strong film background , I ca n't speak Kubrick work whole . I see would interesting could work . That said , I really n't think right choice Shining case . The inner life characters , particularly Jack , IS story . I suppose I saying going , I read Shining knew King famously hated Kubrick version , given Kubrick reputation much people like movie , I assumed I find King complaints unfounded . Instead , fifteen minutes movie , I completely understood agreed King . If I written Shining adaptation I got , I would pissed . It brilliantly shot designed movie many respects , butchers book . Now , would forgivable Kubrick replaced something . But instead , really get great cinematography . I honestly seriously reminded newer directors like Christopher Nolan JJ Abrams . Both really know put together really well shot , paced , acted movie , perfectly willing sacrifice character , depth , logical consistency drop hat . ",0
20648,"I feel like I great job communicating . The point I trying * make partially touched : I n't think piece art reproach accurately , critique . It seems really want say issues , goes . Keep mind , I said subjective ( even art ) , nitpicky . First , I feel Kubrick films cold ; inhuman . A stupendous imitation human emotion , imitation , nonetheless . I n't seen films , I suspect true , possibly intentional . The Shining probably worst example , I still feel . As far problems , I stated I n't see point Holleran film . I talking cool book I talking character seems point subverting expectations . I curious I missing something . The movie also seems show Jack everyman driven insane , mentioned elsewhere thread , Nicholson seems crazy word go . What Wendy character , besides mother also scared ? Now , see ? I told criticisms deep enough really figuratively fight . I wanted try say , already said piece art pedestal high negative word uttered without scorn . I guess . The movie amazing . Beautiful cinematography , mysterious , disturbing , rife different interpretations . Nothing sacrosanct . Also , I really like trolling Kubrick nerds . ( That part joke ) ",0

Kubrick fantastic director shots movie incredible overall plot character development book butchered movie . Jack supposed flawed , yet overall good guy slowly descends insanity hands hotel . But movie ’ outright loony beginning seems qualms new hatred Wendy Jack book really big struggle . Danny eyes important character book one shining hotel reacting way . He ’ also mature young age get see learn evolving thought process hard decisions make watching beloved father go insane become dangerous . In movie Danny kinda creepy little kid weird finger thing ’ really offer much else story . Finally , Wendy . In book Wendy total badass . She ’ put Jacks shit gets crazier constantly battling making sure knows Danny number one priority keep safe matter . In movie Wendy big whiny cry baby ’ purpose movie scream cry . I really ’ mean rant long post really struck chord I read book watched movie first time also unimpressed movie I thought gon na great . My final complaint lot major plot points book ( Dick sensing something wrong coming back Florida save Danny , Jacks intense regret breaking Danny ’ arm hindering thoughts harming hotel putting head , etc ) seemed happen movie next explanation . Like I knew happening I finished reading book , I ’ I feel I would ’ quite confused lot stuff sort happened . Anyways , rant lol . ",0
20659,"I agree Stephen King criticisms , especially regards A. Jack Nicholson seeming insane first scene B. Wendy depiction/Kubrick treatment Shelly Duvall . That said , I think Shining novel pretty bad disorganized relative books King putting time . If look Carrie Long Walk ( published later written Shining ) , see SK telling tightly-written , engaging story evocative , subtly deployed themes . The Long Walk allegory Vietnam pointed obvious even necessary understanding book . Carrie pretty brutal account child abuse/bullying/conformity uses epistolary format implicate entire community complicit abuses Carrie suffers . SK wrote Shining , around three times long books , handle tell big , ambitious story , novel suffers . In beginning obvious exposition/foreshadowing scene Jack boiler guy , goes forever basically spells entire ending book . We got ridiculous wasp scene Jack like , REALLY LIFE IS LIKE WASPS whatever . Not subtle compelling . The whole novel feels really disorganized like , tons great ideas peppered really weak writing structurally bizarre choices . I think call Kubrick movie bad adaptation n't literally adapt action book kind dumb . Or least literal understanding good bad adaptation . As filmmaker nothing saying owe direct fidelity source material ; version Shining perfectly adheres SK vision already exists , novel . So I really nitpicking whether movie captures versus , thing judged merits . So I think lot Shining book versus movie discussion kind pointless : cares Kubrick n't interested things King ? To say Shining film would interesting direct adaptation novel totally disengenuous . If want direct adaptation , Shining tv miniseries 90s , closely adheres book ( Stephen King wrote screenplay ) unwatchable . Just godawful . ",1
20662,"Are fucking mind ? King hit miss . The Shining one great stories , however , The Shining one Kubrick great films . I think maybe need read King think Kubrick missed great opportunity . The story film two completely different things , art , The Shining far superior . ",1

20667,"The novel good read , movie Kubrick simply awesome iconic . Stanley Kubrick took something good read , edited unnecessary things added touches make masterpiece . I like King , sour grapes part . He made version The Shining mini-series director Mick Garris 1997 , faithful novel . It quite underwhelming mediocre viewing . The original movie lightyears beyond mini-series . ",1

20679,"> people n't care Kubrick , King afficiandos . Well , . I think * The Shining * terrible adaptation , middling film . Kubrick seems masterful cinematographer ( photographer ) made series interesting films , peaked * 2001 * , parlayed career frustrated largely incompetent writer - hampered remote cold nature - pampered indulged Warners absurd degree , allowing uncaring perfectionist human could making increasingly cold heartless movies largely indistinguishable product anyone else working time - given similar studio leeway - could made well ( possessing , presumably , warmth humanity Kubrick struggled ) even better , middling adaptations novels , made masterpiece * Eyes Wide Shut * , I think probably best achievement , I ca n't imagine people hate .

More faithful book , yes , Kubrick direction , editing , cinematography brought much table , nobody made films quite like Kubrick . I really enjoyed Doctor Sleep ( movie ) tied original novel film together . It felt like director , Mike Flanagan , made place love novel film , could justice .

Doctor Sleep threw garbage , said “ yeah magic , ’ vampires , satisfy masses. ” I wish never written book , I wish I ’ never read . It ruined magic Shining adding needed .

20806,"Firstly , I absolutely love take The Shining ( book movie ) agree . Stephen King writing Jack past slow descent madness hotel evil play weaknesses , masterfully done . His moment redemption well necessary moment especially Danny . This character devolution redemption moment things I think movie sorely lacked . Wendy character well , much stronger book movie . IMO , definitely IT next read . Amazing book . For always toss The Shining IT favourite SK books . You also get sequel The Shining i.e . Doctor Sleep . Not good , satisfying read adult Danny . 11/22/63 also really good , Salem Lot . For , Cujo tragic I never could reread . Even I get tears eyes I think last lines Cujo . The best SK recommendations IMO would include ( amongst others ) : Duma Key , Bag Bones , Misery , Needful Things Different Seasons ( last collection four novellas , excellent ) . You try Dark Tower fantasy slant , though I never really got , although The Stand probably one recommended , favourite mine . Try short story collections well continue love work . ",1

20835,I liked lot . But I read almost King I get ahold . It lot different shining though . ,1
20837,"Why cringe ? Kubrick superb The Shining truly great film . The book may better , n't automatically make movie terrible , let alone cringeworthy . ",1
20842,"While I also worried sequel little sketchy , King vampires right , long Twilight garbage . Nobody wanted vampire reading King versions . From I read far though , seems like real connection The Shining Danny character , I think could compelling story adult version . At least voices head tell , Mrs. Torrance . ",1
20845,"> In King universe , vampires suck blood . He writes pretty mean psychic and/or Life force vampire . He specifically said . That almost exactly described . He said feed people Shining , target Danny Torrence . ",1
20849,"I think Lolita almost Kubrick film adaptations better novels inspired . This especially , although I consider lesser work part , well , maybe King since lesser King really describe vast library schlock interspersed better works . That said , I rewatched The Shining weekend knowing Kubrick editorial liberty regarding Halloran made really long trip Overlook darkly funny nihilistic kind way . ",0
20851,"I generally respect Kubrick work , I respectfully disagree . In way The Shining ( movie ) better The Shining ( book ) . While I would n't go far say The Shining masterpiece horror fiction , pretty damn close actually frightening throughout much read , whereas move version little thriller interspersed Kubrick usual visual experimentation . I would definitely say experience mediums could choose one , take pass film version . ",0
20852,"That , rendered entire existence useless film . I generally think surprise people read book , terrible reason anything . The thing value Kubrick gave The Shining shot twin girls . No way words page could ever captured moment way . Other , book easily superior . ",1
20853,"The Shining one Stephen King books I actually enjoyed . Tried bunch others ( Salem Lot , Carrie , Pet Cemetery others n't pop head right ) I never really got . The Shining though one favorite books time . It probably stuck much I read young maybe 11-12 , maybe even younger pretty sure I read least highschool ( retrospect , probably best age read .. .but meh ) . I remember well rounded characters stood even realistic relateable characters make effective horror story , I think ( especially since I never particularly touched horror movies books , even kid ) . Never really liked Jack Nicholson Shining movie , despite praise got , exactly I felt n't really manage capture subtle touches book , n't manage really replicate full depth characters . ",1
20854,"Dr. Sleep surprisingly good . Not The Shining level good , solid sequel . ",1
20855,After long time I finally sat read The Shining well . It suprisingly refreshing book . I actually thought would seem dated I enjoyed quite bit . I n't intend read King books seems The Stand also well worth . ,1
20857,"Even though I think Stephen King overrated writer ever , The Shining , It , Misery favorites . The Stand ok , much long , climax underwhelming . ",1
20858,"Yeah , I think first I read one lesser 90s works , I could probably figure I went folks found oldest looking paperback name . I also really enjoyed Desperation wrote pen name , years later uni flatmate let pen-name secret . After usually year , picked holidays real rhyme reason choices . Rose Madder sticks Duma Key . The Stand , I realised part way I reading extended version , one publisher cut . It long read , 1/4 I totally hooked . His best books ones hints macabre , subtle terrors become full blown . Anyway back The Shining , I suspect I read younger I would loved , way catalogues temper , writers block , demons , I suspect resonates adult . The subtle slipping reality brilliant . ",1
20861,"I read first time couple weeks ago loved . He many great books get looked favor big ones like The Shining IT . Tommyknockers , Desperation , Revival , Lisey Story , Apt Pupil Firestarter favorites seems like nobody talks . ",1

Within , walls continued upright , bricks met neatly , floors firm , doors sensibly shut ; silence lay steadily wood stone Hill House , whatever walked , walked alone. ” * Makes shiver ! ",1
20872,"HHH The Shining similar , King said Jackson ’ book best haunted house story ever written . They get sense dread , I think , hitting literally live supposed safe . ",1

20879,"The book version The Shining much scarier movie , imo . Kubrick destroyed sense dread got knowing Jack going insane . ",1
20880,It remind The Shining extent . But felt like masterclass books vein . ,1
20881,"King tendency ramble , fair , moderated recently . But best books goes sparse-mode . Revival , The Shining , If It Bleeds example . And yes , female characters lets kind say 'thinly drawn ' . Although I absolutely adore Holly Gibney character . If enjoy measured , deliberate style horror writing give Peter Straub try . Koko one best thriller/horrors I ever read . His prose almost British clipped , precise yet evocative style . ",1

Although I gathered friends King people messed stuff straight horror , n't unexpected ; I still pleasantly surpised good character pyschology . And directness candidness people life reminded Kurt Vonnegut , I felt right home Vonnegut favorite author . ",1
20901,"King characters - throughout work , The Shining - remain best written ones I ever read . And , IMO , key reason movie adaptations works fail concentrate much horror/thriller aspects lose characters motivations . The ones succeeded - Green Mile , Dolores Claiborne , Shawshank - done put characters first . ",1

The badguys started kinda scary . I originally thought Dan True met would badass showdown would hell pay . But fuckers got sick died big finale . I loved characters , I wished suspense . ) ",1
20915,Just last week I finished 11/22/63 holy shit awesome ! It also first King novel . I almost done Under Dome also amazing . I pretty excited I get experience greatness I keep hearing first time . I think I going The Shining next . ,1

20925,"Spot ! My exact thoughts movie / book debate * The Shining * ! You read sequel , * Doctor Sleep * , Danny grown still struggling demons . Not good scary first , decent sequel ( SK wrote many years later ) .

Shawshank Redemption , Apt Pupil , The Body , The Breathing Method - 4 excellent ) ",1
20926,"The Langoliers story Four Past Midnight . Had SciFi ( pre-SyFy ) TV movie ’ pretty accurate adaptation . Pet Semetary one bleakest endings book ever .

But I prefer The Regulators would love see movie . The Running Man . +10 ’ let book affect movie mind . It . Holy crap . If ’ know happens end absolutely look .

20932,"I finished reading The Shining week ago . Also first King book . I busy reading The Stand moment . I loved The Shining , characters interesting well portrayed . Jack likeable flawed ; reprehensible ways , sympathetic others . His slow descent madness terrifyingly captivating . King portrayal Danny great well , naive also wise beyond years result gift . He also nailed feeling one gets child certain word phrase uttered parent passing , innocuously , becomes memory really sticks , surfaces time time subconscious . > C H E A P P R I C K The length build one best things book , opinion .

One thing I always enjoyed Stephen King writing idiomatic . I found interesting story told several points view person personal way speaking comes interior dialogues . One thing took surprise final scene last chapter Danny sitting dock talking Mr Halloran . That scene incredibly touching tender I found tearing . I presently reading * * Doctor Sleep * * , King 2013 sequel Danny adult . I say kept one night reading . Do n't want give anything away say enjoyed The Shining , I highly encourage read sequel . ",1

20970,"I read The Shining Girls loved . But I tell people : time-traveling serial killer , people skeptical work ( I tell works great . ) Did encounter resistance tried publish novel , maybe merged many genres ( sci-fi , thriller , horror ) ? ",1
20971,"I big fan , loved Zoo City The Shining Girls Broken Monsters well . However ! One thing really struck Broken Monsters fantastic straight ( non-speculative ) thriller , 90 % book , exactly read book . At point , events happen overtly supernatural , longer making dual reading interpretation possible . As Mulholland publish fantastic non-supernatural thrillers ( ex . Warren Ellis ' Gun Machine , good recommendation liked Broken Monsters ) real thought finishing novel ambiguity intact , leaving question completely open reader , rather coming definitively side supernatural ?

They 're Claytons . Clayton Broken Monsters something else entirely , reveals book . He even monster . He broken . ",0
20981,"The Shining absolute favourite book . I found parts superb . It n't Jack acting , Overlook working Jack . We see line end Jack tells Danny run remember much loves . Jack would never hurt Danny , Overlook overcame order get Danny . Doctor Sleep good , n't expect another Shining . Good time reading The Stand cause coronavirus . I currently reading well . Mammoth book - ~467,000 words I believe . Make sure get complete uncut version . The Stand takes page one . ",1
20982,"I Stephen King fan , although I n't read everything single book ever written . I finally read * The Shining * month two ago , I really liked , despite fact I knew lot scenes going . I saw movie years ago I n't impressed , I probably would like even less I read book . The idea changes Kubrick made bother , took lot depth characters . The escalation certain character anger perfectly done book , nuanced film . The movie pretty cool visually , though . ",1
20983,"This book really scared , feeling hard find I n't felt anything like ( recently Phantoms Koontz creepy ) . The shining plain creepy scary time , scene I emotionally remember ( details fleeting ) boy standing end hall man dog suit something starts running yelling things genitals . It horrible experience I highly recommend one King best . ",0
20986,"King said Kubrick believe supernatural understand King concept hotel kind storage battery evil . King also said Kubrick never understood King meant evil sort objective , external force absent human actions . So Kubrick made movie alcoholism , isolation insanity instead . I think Kubrick improved movie inarguably effective horror movie . It probably one top ten horror movies ever made one scariest . I kind wish Kubrick done straight horror movies . I old enough seen * The Shining * original theatrical run . I probably 13 14 . My parents took . They Stephen King fans early . I n't think I ever scared movie theater . The naked old lady scene scared living shit . Imagine seeing movie without knowing anything going happen . That probably impossible , I n't know woman going turn old lady . The dude getting blown bear extremely WTF , even though n't scary exactly . The Here Johnny line actually got big laugh theater . It n't cliche yet . It caught us surprise . I think movie better book case . It happens . There several Stephen King books I would like see get better movie treatments got , though , example , * The Running Man * , great , tense little thriller nothing like cheesy , WWE style Arnold Schwarzeneggar spectacle movie turned . * Salem Lot * remade . All ever gotten lame . 1970 TV miniseries starring David Soul . It really good book . Classic King , always kind radar . There great movie waiting get made . ",1
20987,"Yeah , The Dead Zone recommended King fans . I taking break stuff time , definitely near top list future King books I like check . I disappointed The Shining , King overall style still chewy enough I see exploring stuff future . Probably Dead Zone , It , and/or Salem Lot . ",1

Over week I read book I felt like I could really relate Jack . I started getting withdrawn group even started getting paranoid . I scared death building , especially night I would walk dark hallway unoccupied part house . That two years ago . I still think book lot I never come close finding something similar effect . I guess perfect storm , Overlook type place unfamiliar secluded . That book really fucked way I would love experience . ",1

Ancillary Justice Ann Leckie 9/10 The reason I ca n't give 10 I felt writing times difficult understand . I know hard write Leckie general hard scifi themes mixed Breq constantly shifting perspective occasionally confusing . The story phenomenal writing refreshing despite nitpicking .

20995,"I think interpretation book entirely valid . I hard pressed see anyone read end * The Shining * know hotel charge Jack—there many instances King makes quite clear . There issues play : one many people conflate book Kubrick film , Jack unhinged stereotyped first scene ; secondly , swathe readers n't experienced enough , even inclined , recognise subtext 'trashy horror novel ' , n't , wo n't , see . You seem empathetic friends regard , maybe n't hard . Jack background novel classic abused-turned-abuser . None takes away , , decent husband father , flawed . It point vulnerable , rocks Overlook Hotel , gets claws . This clearly King view , quite deliberately gives Jack scene redemption end > ! comes senses moment lets Danny escape ! < . ",1

The sequel Doctor Sleep decent , quite good . It almost could completely different novel , ties The Shining . ",1

And already experienced * The Shining * . I highly recommend reading book * It * next . * Salem Lot * great vampire story ( glitter hair mousse ) * Christine * great , especially like cars .

21008,Dark Materials must-read sure . SPQR great somebody wanting dive Ancient Rome first time . Survivor I read two days . The Shining I read three . That must mean something ! ,1
21009,"You 're quite correct . Since Kubrick adaptation dominant version story pop culture , sadness personal failings book inspire genuine empathy sympathy characters gone . Uncle Stevie said never really liked adaptation precisely reason . \ [ It's\ ] cold , said . To paraphrase , said felt Kubrick treated Torrances little rats lab rather human beings . He n't wrong . While Shining film n't bad overall , also really story King wrote . ",1
21010,"I definitely find The Shining scary per se . Definitely unsettling , overall description matched I felt . What even scarier slight projection King written Jack Torrance . Man , good book . ",1
21014,"Both Pet Sematary The Shining , King writes passages * something * lulling characters sleep , sleep ca n't break , matter hard try . I nightmares long I remember see put words really freaks . ",1
21016,"I must one finds King ’ books long boring . Don ’ get wrong , I love good 700 page book supernatural themes nothing . I struggled IT , Pet Cemetery The Shining . Snooze fest ! I prefer psychological thriller . Something actually take place . The human brain mental health far chilling . ",0
21017,I found The Shining genuinely scary . ,1
21018,The disturbing book I ’ read The Shining Stephen King . Only wasps 🙄 I reading though I know I young I read haha ,1
21019,"I love horror books hardly ever find actually frightening . The two exceptions second half Cujo , scene The Shining inanimate object suddenly animate - like Danny staring fire hose , thinking looks like big snake , suddenly falls wall toward . That part made physically flinch I reading . ",1
21021,"The 2 books ever actually gave scared feeling The Shining The Amityville Horror . The scene The Shining old woman bathtub tries strangle Danny made uneasy , The Amityville Horror whenever talked seeing eyes looking window creeped . Seeing someone looking window probably biggest fear , wrote really well book . ",1
21022,Also one best books I ’ ever read . Whenever I think The Shining I think absolute terror I reading firehose . King master . ,1
21024,"Having read The Shining King hotel early hours , I dan totally relate feeling . ",1
21025,"Very nice . I hope n't mind , I added contrast decreased saturation : [ Shining ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/NG3OC.jpg ) ",1
21028,"Dr. Sleep OK . It really even related much The Shining , story Danny adult . A nice read . It neither adds takes away The Shining . You see movie , though . In opinion , lifelong SK fan , ONLY movie adaptation one works worth seeing . ",1
21030,"lot tv version shining , god awful . edit : Apparently Kubrick knew King n't like version . So beginning Kubrick version , helicopter shot highway , car fire ( I think blue ? ) . King version opens ( I believe ) blue car traveling along highway . I might specifics wrong , gist Kubrick giving big fuck King . ",0
21032,"The first like 300 pages shining I thought alright , last half amazing . And last half ’ great without things first 300 pages connecting . It ’ worth finishing ! ",1
21033,"Of King ’ work , The Shining Apt Pupil , maybe It , ones stick closest something appear . Also , like historical fiction , The Terror Dan Simmons good pick . Survival horror supernatural elements , set context Shackleton type expedition . ",1
21035,Please read . It fantastic book . The shining fourth King book I read The Stand best . ,1
21036,"Absolutely ; book much better movie , much better storytelling job . It good movie , n't hold candle book .

21038,The Shining favorite horror movie horror novel . I highly recommend reading book different movie . There lot events happen book movie cut either budgetary reasons special effects time n't allow . The book also scarier opinion . ,1
21039,"In nearly cases , King books better films , many adaptations worth seeing least . The best ones focus character , threat/monster . That lot live-action versions stories fall . King makes care cast * * threat , matter far-fetched , scary . I probably minority , I also recommend hunting TV mini-series The Shining . The cast n't good , course , competent . The FX dated ( CGI still polished ) , longer format gives sense story unfolding , background , etc . It also features injury polo mallet one effective cringe-inducing blows I seen falls less category . The blow midsection , blood , staging conveys punch actors carry delivery severe internal injuries quite well . If nothing else , watch 're completist . ",1
21040,"The movie book two different things , plus done reading The Shining read sequel Doctor Sleep . ",1
21043,I agree The Shining . I read I 15 scared daylights . ,1
21044,"For , horror genre , would also * The Shining * SK , novella * Apt Pupil * terrifying non-supernatural way . * Angel Manor * Chantal Noordeloos vivid , gory scary horror book . ",0
21048,"Maybe unpopular opinion , I think Doctor Sleep one King ’ best books . It ’ supposed like The Shining . It ’ product DECADES King mulling question : happens Danny grows ? He develops nice little contained horror novel world horrors exist outside mental breakdown alcoholic father kid vaguely alluded supernatural abilities . What ’ wrong developing something bit different ? If thing early King , contained psychological plots like Misery The Shining , maybe ’ . But I personally love books , recognizing genre . One psychological horror , supernatural adventure . And ’ fun ! I liked characters , I like relationships , cheesy wanted win ’ always good feeling . ",1
21051,"Cujo though well written , felt bit far fetched . Too many things left fate . A good read nevertheless , eerie The Shining IMO . ",1
21054,"I read The Shining hotel ! Luckily room 217 n't exist , cus would floor . ",0
21057,"The Shining way , actually . It far superior movie . Christine another one early favorites , Duma Key great recent book . ",1
21059,Was hoping . The Shining favorite Kubrick movie I love everything . ,1
21060,"yes , worth read . Personally , I think one best works long long time . We levels Salem Lot Shining , Stand , questions ( , ) . The smart thing find smart balance things leftover Shining new things . The old Shining things , apart shining capability , kept minimum : first chapter Doctor Sleep , means , new chapter The Shining : characters , bad guys , setting . But Doctor Sleep turns completely different thing : I n't want write spoilers , love King loved Shining , I say 98 % 3/4 guaranteed like one . Plus , invention Steam one coolest ideas I seen long ",1
21061,"I finished last night , could help devouring . Dr. Sleep creepy ambience strong character development I love King writing , definitely much stronger book evocative earlier writing , fantastic . He pulls stops one , awesome connections avoiding spoilers , enjoyed The Shining , love greater depth Danny Torrance characterwqa story rollicking thriller start gets better . But , I unapologetic King addict . ",1
21064,"It would really hurt OCD didnt read The Shining first . It good book , really nothing lose ! ",1
21066,"I n't read Doctor Sleep yet , I think read Shining first simply excellent book . Granted , I n't read since high school first book scare bone . Like sleep lights kind scared . ",1
21067,"Definitely read The Shining first . But important thing consider Stanley Kubrick movie adequate representation The Shining . If seen movie read Dr. Sleep , wo n't make sense Kubrick left lot essential stuff put lot stupid stuff . That said , Dr. Sleep effing amazing . ",1
21070,"Here [ detailed review Amazon ] ( http : //www.amazon.com/review/R1A0MRYN8TVVHT/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm ) . I n't think people appreciated allegorical references , anything else lousy review please let know . Two things answer question : * Scare-for-scare , content Doctor Sleep . Fans original book movie may think The Shining , . King brings first ghost Doctor Sleep within five pages . He n't bring first ghost The Shining page one-fifty . * There lot reference Doctor Sleep draw original book . You fine skip directly Doctor Sleep , may appreciate read The Shining first . Many famous movie scenes never show book ( twins , ax , bloody elevator ) . And one final point : King today much improved King thirty years ago . I like , I started path King going back early material hard trip travel . His writing vastly improved years . He may intoxicating drunken writing days , I take trade-off cleaner writing style . EDIT : forgot add link review ",1
21071,"In opinion connection The Shining reason give Doctor Sleep try . I finished think one worst Kings I ever read . Boring , dragging uninspired , often reads like fantasy novel Shining terrified , one scare . Not even little bit . Also , showdown one biggest letdowns novels . ",0
21072,"I would concur . Just finished mine day loved . OP read standalone book I think people read The Shining appreciate much , much . On , good . As sequel , great . ",1
21073,"I n't advice , I spot first time I read The Shining . I big King fan . He got good stuff , far misses hits , imo . However , The Shining great worth interrupted sleep ( staying late night finish ) . The Shining one books got reading horror . Books reproduce ( good ? ) scared feeling The Shining something I look horror books . ",1
21074,I read The Shining I 13 14 scared silly . ,1
21075,I one agree . I think King much better writer 33 years ago wrote The Shining . I understand Jack influence hotel I n't find dialogue super believable . Seemed really clunky sort turned . ,0
21076,"Every subsequent book The Dark Tower better The Gunslinger . Black House better The Talisman . Most Dresden Files better Storm Front . The Daniel Faust series significantly better first book . The first book The Death gate Cycle weakest imo . There loads . I also agree Doctor Sleep better The Shining . I liked , The Shining I dunno blandness maybe ? It n't feel way King writing usually . I n't get invested characters , n't feel connection themes story I work . Doctor Sleep qualities . I still think better significant chunk catalogue , something missed mark . It felt like half finished comic book drawing . You see talent , already amazing , n't inked finalized . ",1
21077,"Haha I saw title , * The Shining * * Doctor Sleep * answer automatically , even reading . I read pretty close together , I could really see difference . I also think Danny better POV character Jack . Of course , I think big part King improved writer n't going issues . * Doctor Sleep * might one favorite King books . ",1
21079,"The book considerably different many places . I wo n't point , since n't read yet , one general thing tone . King good creating sympathetic characters , version certain warmth . Kubrick vision , probably noticed , cold , clinical almost alien . Also , read The Shining , follow Doctor Sleep , King wrote recently sequel The Shining . I thought excellent . ",1
21080,"When sit book , forget movie . Just , think Kubrick The Shining totally different thing , similar setting character list . That damn near similarities end anyway . The book really family , Danny overall experience , Jack corruption descent madness . In movie , Jack shows Overlook already pretty far gone kinda takes Danny Wendy along ride . They 're good , best taken separate entities entirely . ",1
21084,"The thing happened couple years ago . But transition smooth enough . If I remember correctly , I started Dan Brown book ( Da Vinci code , probably ) . It interests lie . For , I love thrillers , horror , lgbtq stories like . If 're book , best put away start another line interests . Two months ago , I finished The Shining took 2 weeks read even though I love horror genre ! This book n't everyone cup tea times , extremely boring . If like reading King books , pick 'Misery ' . It 400 pages long I guess far better read The Shining imo . If 're fantasy , always start basic ones like Harry Potter Percy Jackson - even re-reading series get bookworm zone . Once mind spirit get habituated reading , new book surely capture interests ! Welcome back reading I hope find book keep planted time around ! 🙂 ",0
21085,"Omg ! I followed users ' recommendation I reading lighter book shelf . It week managed read 5 chapters , compared 2 chapters The Shining 3 months . I working way ! ",0
21087,"The insight The Shining scary dad anger problem makes want read I father 2 year old . Also , speaking kids , Stephen King fans go check son Joe Hill work . Arguably good better King ( notably , King gave son credit coming superior ending 11/22/63 one originally conceived ) . Horns amazing book NOS4A2 comes couple months . ",1
21090,My favorite book go Desperation Shining still . ,1
21093,"Would n't hurt , necessary . You kind need familiar main characters The Shining . It several years since I read The Shining I n't problem Dr. Sleep . Really enjoyed actually . ",1
21094,"I read Dr. Sleep months ago . Read The Shining 15 years ago , details definitely fuzzy . Dr. Sleep stand alone , likely enjoy read The Shining first . It great book , totally worth . ",1

21097,"I read quite bit King . Out , I thought The Shining terrifying . So one favorites . ",1
21098,"There parts The Shining brought Doctor Sleep might spoil The Shining read DS first . It imperative , still book , goes long way helping understand Danny motivations . The Shining fantastic book read anyway . ",1
21099,"If want Doctor Sleep , I say read . What got lose ? The Shining great book . ",1
21102,"You read Doctor Sleep first , takes away entire experience reading The Shining . Most plot recapped first chapters I remember correctly much better experienced actually reading . ",0
21103,"Agreed . The Shining one best earlier works ; Carrie Salem Lot good , n't yet gotten form together . The Shining excellent . I defy picture Nicholson Duvall roles reread , though . I n't issues Scatman Crouthers , n't like cast . ",1
21104,"Definitely . King n't like Kubrick movie ( good reasons ) says afterword * Dr. Sleep * book ( * The Shining * ) definitive history Torrance family . The important takeaway book vs. movie movie really screwed Jack n't start insane . He weak , recovering alcoholic , evil spirits hotel take advantage less take . He evil start . Definitely read * The Shining * reading * Dr . Sleep . * There things happened book happen movie referred * Dr. Sleep * I imagine might confusing . ",0
21107,"One problem better often 're talking enjoyed , entertaining . No one deny movie The Shining extremely entertaining point us instantly identify even teeniest portion scene come movie . But admit movie entertaining sensationalistic . It sense , really delivered . But movie dropped bit nuance relating Jack & inner demons , explored book . That brings us back full circle better movie dazzled good actors effective scare effects , book also delivered scare department , spent lot time back story & psychological detail main character . ",1
21108,The Princess Bride Jurassic park least author work script works . The Shining hated author ( good reason read book ) . ,0
21112,"Not . In fact , one reasons Stephen King disliked movie version The shining : Wendy reduced whiny victim strong character wrote novel . ",0

21118,"Those King read ? I love Stand , I think * * IT * * better . It scared shit . It book ever really . I could n't read night . The Gunslinger , , series , might literary . Well , The Shining ( said already ) , Salem Lot . He really lot great shit . Especially younger . There sweet spot career voice fully matured , still listen editor . The Bachman books , get original copy Rage , fucking AWESOME . I almost feel like King best short stories . Then The fucking STAND , like said . And IT . Oh , dude , Misery . MMM , Misery fucking great . Just read , I guess . I mean , skip Rose Madder Cell Gerald Game dross , Oh , come back comment . I remembered Pet Semetary . That book haunting . Like kids I know King incredibly popular , gives people cause disregard artistic merit , reason people get popular King awesome . ",1
21119,"Ok I loved book disagree ending . I thought total shit . In fact , read dozens King books I started realize many absolute garbage endings . Pet Cemetery The Shining THE two exceptions , imho . ",0
21120,"* SPOILERS * I probably going get voted shit I fucking hated book . I loved shining immediately read book left wondering , What actual fuck ? ! Seriously ? That end story ? ! There literally point main characters traveling Las Vegas trashcan man showed nuclear bomb hand God came flag became ball energy blew everyone . Nothing eluded protagonists impact events . They happened would happened . I say , though I super book left confront flag . The moment decided leave , characters actions failed make sense . ",0
21121,"As constant reader King otherwise completely unqualified assess quality literary works , I believe basically 3 eras King literature . The Early Years ( early mid seventies ) King hungry young author trying catch break . This era best represented * The Shining * . His stories period new , shocking , visceral , perhaps bit unpolished . The Cocaine Years ( late seventies late eighties ) King serious alcoholic drug addict height powers . Everything wrote era absolute dynamite IMHO , I pick one defining work period , would * The Dark Tower : The Gunslinger * The Serious Years ( early nineties present ) King becomes conscious role literature begins produce sophisticated , cerebral , subtle works . And less dark horrifying , something missing I compare work 80 . I ca n't put finger , I know . None work period bad , nothing era left breathless like * The Stand * * It * . * The Stand * I would consider first book cocaine years . He still passion hungry young artist , really hit stride . It story told many times , told best . I read 20 years ago , I still name virtually every character recount plot . ",1
21124,"For longest time I thought King quickly churned cheap horror stories . I shied away books years years . Then I watched 11/22/63 Hulu loved enough seek book . I glad I . That book amazing , like absolutely brilliant . So reading , I branched The Shining I always liked film . That incredibly intense read , . After I finished , I wanted branch something I n't heard much . So I asked friends pretty unanimous I give The Stand read . So I , completed The Stand sharing reddit lol . ",1
21132,"The ending Stand excellent . Salem Lot , Shining , The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon , strong . The Talisman Black House two strongest endings books I read . Could go . Most books strong endings . Edit : books ending pedantic amongst us : - ) ",1
21133,"Pet Sematary amazing ending . Christine good . Salem Lot , The Shining , The Talisman good endings may , man . ",1
21134,'Here Johnny ! ' - The Shining ( 1980 ) ,1
21136,"To Stephen King often playing supernatural note real human problems , troubles , diseases , limitations , crisis . Here Jack dad alcoholic . He abusive father . The troubles addiction trauma causes seeps generations . The Overlook hotel seen larger sense psychopathic society live - racist , addicted , loaded unmet unrepentant horrors native americans , blacks enslaved Jack comes Overlook recovery alcohol addiction - abstaining drinking - psychopathic hotel pulls drinking The Shining sense utilized , somewhat washed abilities prescient , gut feelings , know future , relate others non-verbals without words In order access talent must turn TV - involve creative processes - open right brain psychopathic society severely undervalues - especially school early development .... To messages I glean book - less movie If look comments made - frame superimposed seen way Jack slipping demon drink The movie Kubrik loaded statements artistic impressions . ",1
21137,"Anyone thinks King ca n't write take look passage . I think sympathy Jack * The Shining * makes novel disturbing troubling beautiful . In many works , writer hero , explores happens evil wins . The thing hints , explores writes Bachman , oftentimes dark , terrible ending truer one better one . I think allows novels end tragically writing best . ",1

21144,"Why n't King say fuck write something good ? I mean , many millions dollars need ? He sit write great American novel . Even falls flat face , least would made attempt instead churning sequel * The Shining * fuck sake . We know going worthless trash even writes . ",0
21145,"Honestly , Stephen King movies made , I say The Shining , IMHO , one best . You correct , differs quite bit book , I n't think necessarily bad thing ; King tells stories perspective really tied character way think , mood , going heads , REALLY difficult portray film , difficult convey narrative characters thoughts . I think Kubrick knew , instead trying ( potentially poorly ) portray book exactly , left elements suited literature ( much actual shining Danny , lot internal struggle Jack etc . ) instead used techniques build feel atmosphere book film ; things like long slow shots , use steady cam , interesting angles ( things n't apply literature ) . Personally , I * love * King , way writes , sometimes best written material makes REALLY poor movies ( ending It miniseries comes mind ) . ",1
21146,"Wait , talking true book ? Because stand alone film , The Shining pretty damn good . I n't read book , I ca n't comment . If 're talking true book , I Legend would worst I ever seen . I quite like book movie though . ",0

21151,"It irritates end people , like OP , judge book adaptations based similar book . They movie regarded seperate piece art intentions . It judged book n't exist .

21153,"Almost finished The Shining Stephen King . Very thrilling I liked even I like film , I n't expect happen . Both excellent right , I like book makes Jack much deeper character . ",1
21154,"In order get big picture , watch documentary The Shining , Room 237 . Kubrick used novel vehicle artistic themes , movies . He bought rights books proceeded gut maintain plot points way threading narrative . If watch The Shining mind , start see differences , start realize even horror story traditional sense . It story past . Not past . The Past . How past impinges present . How shine navigate way history labyrinth release The Overlook . There many , many themes interwoven story : native American genocide ( Calumet cans , Jack throwing tennis ball ritualistically wall mimicking call Native spirits ) , holocaust ( Nazi typewriter , black white outdoor scenes snow falling like ashes Nazi crematoriums ) , moon landing question ( room 237 , watch movie one ) , manager office Jack interviewed job showered sunlight room completely enclosed hotel , tv Wendy Danny watching n't power cord , dozens things everyone knows Kubrick absolute perfectionist never made accidental continuity errors . There literally thousands things notice . And point , creating art conveyed countless subliminal devices . Read Mastermind critique movie net best source interpretations . It exacting exhausting . One thing : Stephen King hate movie brainchild totally missed Kubrick . He essentially banned participation initially consulted objected vociferously Kubrick audacity change VW going mountain ( Going Sun road Montana ) red yellow . Kubrick delivered subtle message King later movie . Remember cook returning hotel snow blizzard passes accident ? A semi completely smashed vehicle . Guess ? A red VW . That Kubrick letting King directly know thought novel . ",1
21155,"I liked Dr Sleep I read came I n't read The Shining years . I think works much later sequel like . I felt nostalgia first novel remember superior two , I enjoyed seeing Danny ( despite bit goofy parts ) I liked traveling group baddies ( I ca n't recall name second ) .

However The Shining , I personally recommend reading book first . Even though adaptation okay , ( like nearly film adaptations ) nowhere near good book . It chilling , gripping , detailed . I also recommend reading book first personal reason - novel The Shining contains one scene book scared hell much made go turn lights . I value book immensely book I ever read invoke reaction . It flawlessly written . I wo n't tell , said scene absent film .

21370,"feminist story n't mean story feminist . One common issues way women portrayed stories zero agency . Gone Girl takes familiar narrative woman goes missing , husband desperate find , sparks support nationwide turns upside . She orchestrating , manipulating public opinion , always one step ahead . What I find interesting people problems indulgent , charismatic , intelligent villains . There shortage Hannibal Lectors , Jokers , Patrick Batemans . We even empathize aspects worldview , spite us clearly understanding evil wrong , reveal something society evil wrong well . What makes Amy Dunne different ? ",1

But , least reading , point monologue less trying play male fantasies eventually drives people crazy , ’ supremely inauthentic person projecting . Amy ’ act ’ start wanted appeal mediocre men ; started Amazing Amy . She makes feminist point , ’ make inherently feminist story . I think vastly underestimating much monologue connected women . Multiple women I know IRL retyped passage put social media . I never seen happen another piece writing . Amy crazy person , cool girl thing describing real pressure women face . Perhaps bit less book originally came , 100 % real pressure . > Now , I ’ guy maybe I ’ missing , basic read story : guy puts bit act get girl ’ league . He loses money , mother gets sick , quickly becomes clear marriage ’ work , kind gross affair younger woman . This makes standard bad dude feel little bit pity ’ tough go ultimately dislike imo . I believe Amy money paid house bar . A big part feels trapped money invested life wants . She trusted trapped dying rust belt town . Then fucking cheated . I think asshole acknowledging .

21412,"This exactly . Gone Girl n't much feminist manifesto satire American marriage . Amy obviously exaggeratedly evil , Nick actions sinister carefree way expected husbands . Over brief course marriage turns independent , successful , prideful , type-A , intelligent woman Stepford Wife . When move midwest Amy n't done anything bad yet , Nick already started treating like villain . He n't ask wants move even tho would said yes . He resents money even gives funds start dream bar . She foreign place , taking plates hosting potlucks like dutiful wife Nick still frames stuck New Yorker . He never vents frustrations gets mad trying get open . He spends money recession shuts brings . Their whole marriage neglects , mom passes basically acts like n't exist . She wealthy , successful writer moved podunk nowhere , let blow money , cleaned house played video games , played nice old country friends , yet acts like mere presence bother . Amy quite extra , high standards . But continuously lowers please . She would never guy Nick initially poses level . He plays role n't . She holds cause wants work , made work , love even also loves idea relationship . As batshit , book make clear reasons loves . Nick n't really seem love much loves bagged smoking hot fuckmaid . She high maintenance Nick wo n't even put normal amount work . He often wo n't even bare minimum husbands . And Amy smart thinks letting . But Nick exerts passive control . She makes smaller smaller please hopes give smallest amount love desperately craves . I would even call abusive . The reason n't see way cause common subtle . The way Amy retaliates inverse Nick . She intentional , calculated , high concept . But Nick put weight go limp . She chained , gets stuck . Nick weathered Amy perfect housewife . Amy forced perfect loving husband . I would n't call Amy villain cause Nick n't protagonist . The book tells stories side side . And 're really supposed root Nick anymore Amy . They 're smug assholes , book movie make clear . Nick n't seem bad cause n't trying break Amy . He n't trying . He n't trying love , protect , even notice . He n't care one bit Amy became tortured shell former self .

You sort , understand women saying men 're saying morph years ALWAYS going jerk men around n't get conversation n't grow . So many conversations unproductive jump . With Gone Girl , I think interesting Madonna/Whore dichotomy various roles women seem assigned fiction changed years many people n't really appreciate much change . There period frankly Women roles often needing shown better men screen often cliche interactions meant show somehow superiority deficiency two characters . But rule tended , good way . Somehow , wrote character , character almost always right . Gone Girl almost adult Cruella Deville - unrepentant overtly bad active story , easy fail realize many women characters forced overly nuanced secretly victim . It trend Malificent AND Cruella Deville live action prequels softening . So , Feminism character going way point write anything .

Dark Places ( edit , got mixed third , Sharp something ) — exploration childhood trauma set background farm foreclosures Satanic Panic . Like books I ’ read Flynn , villain female , nobody likable ( make dislike child , ffs ) , trauma repeating cycle , point someone makes choice break . ",1
21690,"I found Gone Girl far superior , book film . Gillian Flynn great writing 'bad ' women ",1
21694,"I loved Gone Girl , Flynn authorial voice much story . Did n't make 20 pages Girl Train . The writing n't good . ",1
21695,"Yeah . Gone Girl sudden , big shock . The Girl Train , foreshadowed pretty well , ’ huge shock . And gravity twist Gone Girl huge . ",0
21696,"For personally , insights dynamics relationships really made book highlight . The story good , especially Amy chapters drive home much basics flirting , getting together , living together , etc , I felt like I learning much reading . Of course , Amy neurodivergent person , sociopath , view things n't always taken face value , still much truth . Gillian Flynn books also great , different way . I recommend , none left speechless like Gone Girl . ",1
21697,sharp objects sounds really intriguing especially- think gone girl kept lot readers bc saw amy inside- definitely need pick ! ,1

21702,Have tried girl train . I read gone girl book back back nerve wrecking 🤯🤯🤯 ,1
21704,I strongly preferred 2 books Gone Girl . Her writing excellent Gone Girl ended feeling contrived . ,0
21705,"I really loved book . Now people call overhyped people tend something becomes popular—but I think hyped good reason . It n't first book feature dangerous , dark woman * * first openly unabashedly modern times—and I love . Have read Gillian Flynn quote writes dark female characters ? It mini-essay wonderful I heartily agree . Most us women n't dark characters , course , 're also sympathetic flawed roses many authors make us . I loved story explored rage women ( expressed one woman thoughts ) . I said recently another thread , I think many women relate lot Amy : fury despair feeling like always perfect , n't kow-tow guy 're suddenly shrew , harpy , bitch , ugly realization society ( men ) often see objects traded younger , prettier model . Yes , Amy sociopath , women sociopaths—but Amy thoughts gender , male vs female dynamics lot truth merit . I believe Cool Girl stereotype true ; women often pressured act dumb , like sports , drink beer , guy-ish things seem like hang , 're one dudes , really * cool * chick —oh , also hot . But I n't really see much pressure men hot * well * watching romantic-comedies , going spas women , enjoying shopping . I saying pressure men , way less . After , girl drinks beer please man cool chick guy watches Fashion Week shows please girl would called whipped pussy , come dude ! You 're watching fashion shows like ? ! Where balls , man ? I think guys get point . Both Amy Nick awful people . I think difference , Amy nastiness bloomed much darker , dangerous ways girls n't allowed express rage openly . She fel stifled , unwanted , made feel like toy doll whole life messed . But long husband pretended perfect along , act normal . When Nick decided ruin perfect persona , well , lazy cheater flawed human—well , I think Amy rage justifiable . It fair , , expected pretend perfect whole life husband could get away ruining act ? The murder , obviously , justifiable . Nor actual crimes committee . It anger I get . Nick terrible . I feel like pales comparison Amy violence * look * , terrible guy : cheater , unwilling communicate wife , petulant , penchant blame everyone else issues , misogynistic thoughts He piece shit . And ultimately , I n't think Gillian Flynn set goal creating feminist novel . But I think writing female character authors dare , really tapping world , making certain observations gender sex violence kind inadvertently created feminist book . I see nothing wrong . And I loved ending . It frustrating I love author * went . * Cause real life , sometimes endings unhappy ugly . Sorry essay , I lot thoughts Gone Girl lol . ",1
21709,"I ’ give books often , I gave Gone Girl . ",0
21710,"I n't read Gillian Flynn works . I read Gone Girl , I admit gave sour taste . Not implied gender prejudice , simply overall cynical bleak outlook .

What could worse death ? Life . Read want find . ",0

21730,"Eh , I thought concepts original fact got twist halfway instead waiting end good idea , let novel build inevitable conclusion . Calling money-making garbage actually stretch , writer first two novels went largely ignored mild success . Gone Girl tighter interestingly written popular thrillers lately . ",1
21731,"With respect , I disagree . Gone Girl chilling carefully constructed . It also follows logical conclusion n't shy away beautifully bleak ending . ",1

21740,"I loved Gone Girl liked Dark Places decently , I avoided Sharp Objects I thought might gorier . Did find true ? ",0
21741,"I read Gone Girl first thought decent , I picked Sharp Objects day - good ! Dark Places also really good comparison . Gone Girl probably least favorite Flynn books . Her writing style captivating though . ",1
21743,I thought Gone Girl brilliant story told sides . It narrated husband wife . I felt story flowed great n't lulls kept moving rapid pace . Can tell n't like ? ,1
21744,"I also think Flynn terrible writer . Gone Girl one worst books I ever read . The majority characters n't anything except react around , prose written way descriptive , everything happens completely obvious entirely implausible . I ' think Flynn research murder investigation actually run , n't apply story . It Dan Brown bad . ",0
21745,"I n't think Sharp Objects necessarily gorier , I found lot darker disturbing Gone Girl . And even though usually type book I like reading , far favourite books . ",1
21747,"read The Blind Assassin . Gone Girl jumps narrators ( husband , wife ) get Blind Assassin jumps narrators times ( past , present ) book within book OMFG one best books ever . liked liked Gone Girl love . starts bang debatably best ending ever . bagging Ms Flynn , I like work Margaret Atwood best novel . word choice makes reading feel like eating ice cream hot day . n't put sign posts ( 'chapter 2 older sister past tense ' ) figure .

21750,"I never found agreeing idea , I agree . ( Not I believe movie outdo book counterpart , I never came across one Gone Girl . ) I watched movie first , read book year later . There minor differences sure , much movie set tone put viewer edge right times , writing ca n't . But reading book definitely recalled feelings , I highly suggest reading since watched already ! ",1
21751,I think kind point Gone Girl . You n't meant sympathise Nick Amy utterly completely unlikeable . The fact book ended Nick covering Amy despite fact FAKED HER OWN GODDAMN KIDNAPPING absolutely nothing . I genuinely surprised Amy n't face justice . ,0
21753,"I actually think Gillian Flynn really good writer great story-sense ( I really loving SHARP OBJECTS moment ) . She wrote script GONE GIRL , I think collaboration David Fincher really honed meat story way amplified almost trashy , pitch-black comedy elements way really worked cinematically . I ’ aware ’ streamlined compared novel , I think works favor becomes hyper-focused , hilariously bleak polemic American marriage , basically . It ’ trying sprawling mystery , ’ becomes funny mean thriller packs way punch . And actual filmmaking superb Fincher totally tune script Flynn wrote . Generally I think ’ powerful satisfying movie experience reading experience . That ’ knock book , good , movie * great * - thing . ",1
21754,"This EXACT thing happened , grandmother actually . I love Flynn novels , I read , I literally could n't force way Gone Girl every sentence felt like three pages Roman numerals gave worst head ache . ",0
21756,"While Flynn writes amazing amazingly unlikeable characters , I felt difference gone girl 3 narrators , husband , real wife ( part 2 ) fake wife ( dim Amy part 1 ) . I really n't like either character part 2 still unloveable , compelling . Overall I think writing clever sharp . ",1

21760,"There one chapter end Nick realized could n't live without Amy despite horrible things done .... book lost . It amazing book , believe , end fucked .

21790,"For money , Linwood Barclay writes much better thrillers Gone Girl . ",0
21793,"great ! try reading sharp objects dark places . 're easy read gone girl , found sharp objects similarly compelling , still enjoyed . ",1
21794,"Ah book ! The whole thing like I feel uneasy nervous sure Just like portion . Why ashamed What ? I say aversion idea taking advantage manipulative . Shopkeeper : If manipulate mistress keep coming back worth . While necessarily illegal particularly immoral… protagonists shame/embarrassment speaks innocent , conniving selfish . This sneaky streak would n't bothered Rebecca Mrs Danvers , almost whole arc fear manipulated subtly controlled . ",0
21795,"I think best explanation . Although class may come I think point interaction show us protagonist character . Not accept offer feels gross idea picturing type person would accept . It also interesting contrast parts pictures confident knowing Rebecca , understanding actually entails reveal . ",1
21797,"You also add religion . Historically , royalty seen divine right rule , therefore something went wrong ( losing war , male heir ) quite literally fault message God lost His favour sinful transgression . Conversely , becoming king sign God best person job morally pure . Extrapolate downwards , get class mentality people born wealthy families naturally morally superior , people poor innately morally inferior . The upper class moral gatekeepers society ( hence rich people patronising churches individual clergymen , unquestionable right decide worthy patronage ) . If someone better trade literally better person . Similarly , someone rises ranks via trade ( think Captain Wentworth Persuasion ) become socially acceptable money success indicates moral superiority . God indicated worthiness allowing choices result good things . Conversely , women seen decision makers marriage - men choose wife - woman rises station marriage morally questionable . It happens * * marriage takes place determines worth ; success ( children , social success ) , God ratifying rise station . If failure , proof meant role start morally good enough . Rebecca social success helps hide moral failings , whereas protagonist social stumbles n't gauche , sense indicative fundamentally bad/wrong role . ",0
21798,"I happy see ! I discovered du Maurier long ago I ca n't get enough ! She BRILLIANT . I loved Rebecca , Jamaica Inn , My Cousin Rachel almost equally . I also started reading collections short stories . I find writing fascinating . Unique plots , interesting characters , beautiful description . I reading Frenchman Creek next ! Oh I also highly recommend 1940 film version Rebecca . Hitchcock masterful job stayed true text ! Enjoy rest book ! ",1
21799,"One thing great Rebecca reading second time whole different experience . Because know , * know * If anyone could recommend authors like Du Maurier , would swell . ",1
21800,"du Maurier one favorite authors time ! So excited 're experiencing ; nothing like reading * Rebecca * first time ! If enjoy , try * Jamaica Inn * next . I ca n't recommend enough , really strong , tough heroine contrast Mrs. de Winter * Rebecca * . ",1
21801,"I love Daphne Du Maurier ! Rebecca amazing also stressed haha . My favourite book Frenchman Creek nobody ever seems mention . It beautiful , one top five favourite books ever . ",1
21803,"describe everyone asks . Rebecca ’ presence suffocating , love book SO much ",1
21807,My Cousin Rachel n't scary . But keeps guessing . Jamaica Inn scary parts really nothing creepy Rebecca . ,1
21809,"That adaptation made wish brain bleach . Instead taking opportunity show much > ! Rebecca flaunted infidelity , ! < focused increasing romance . ",0
21811,"I think My Cousin Rachel much psychological thriller/horror Rebecca , personally . ",1
21812,I think Netflix series preoccupied making Lily James character strong female protagonist n't realize Rebecca already strong female protagonist . ,0
21814,"Yes ! And n't kind whole point ? That Rebecca larger-than-life powerhouse , even learn true character fate still runs show ! ! ! And get narrator There sooo many interesting things could modern retelling Rebecca Netflix adaptation none . ",0
21815,"Ugh , 're right . If wanted strong female protagonist , world would choose adapt * Rebecca * ? ? ? ! The narrator n't one whole point ( one points , anyway ) . ",0
21818,yess ! ! I think Rebecca F. Kuang sooo good funny passive agressive writer ! This attitude worked wonders book Yellowface ,0
21819,"I n't know every copy , commentary mine Sally Beauman Daphne Du Maurier personal life playing treatment Rebecca narrator thinking book WEEKS reading . She talks Du Maurier life , bisexual past relationships women marrying someone quite conservative moving Egypt ' proper wife ' . Beauman talked Du Maurier possibly basing narrator Rebecca different sides personality , exactly censuring endorsing either end . She sympathetic AND critical women , showing conflict two sides self . She makes another great point , despite narrator story , leave Rebecca name lips memory . 'Well behaved women rarely make history ' . Also please go watch excellent sketch : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=UilXs\_wMRhs ",1
21820,"Rebecca published 1938….I always pictured Maxim older man , old enough served wwi . ‘ What poor wife ? ’ Yes , poor fucking wife . ",0
21821,"Yes ! I love Rebecca , I ’ always happy readers discuss really fascinating gender dynamics Du Maurier exploring . I 100 % agree basically everything Beauman explores excellent afterword - including theory Rebecca character represents threat/alternative Maxim ’ patriarchal class power . The last straw causes murder Rebecca threatens bring illegitimate son Maxim ’ heir inheritor Manderley , breaking line . Maxim ’ entire identity lies gender class power ( passing power sons ) , truly hates much Rebecca ’ cruel , ’ play rules , societal rules . Rebecca , although entirely innocent victim accounts , nonetheless represents powerful foil Maxim ’ patriarchal world . Our unnamed narrator , hand , desperate submit Maxim order gain approval , despite unhappy makes . The scene realizes Maxim pets way pets family dog incredible darkly funny ! My favorite scene last pages novel , narrator dreams Rebecca merging one person , use long hair hang Maxim . She wakes discover Manderley , long-standing symbol Maxim ’ power , flames . So powerful ! ! ",1
21823,"I disagree sexual relationship started confession . She says honeymoon carefree , attentive ardent , friend lover . It ’ returned Manderley resumed distant cold , realizing specter Rebecca personal demons ’ dissipated . I always found weird separate bedrooms , apparently ’ unusual wealthy . Plus lend loneliness isolation . I agree set fail sending incredibly new situation social status absolutely blind . I ’ think purposefully set fail . He ’ considerate . But I ’ sure , really . I also ’ believe grooming malicious intent . More , attracted guileless opposite Rebecca every aspect . But comes whether believe account murder , I . I think Manderley burn set free . As much loved Manderley , Rebecca ’ presence overbearing . The ending open ended . Who say remain unhappy homeless forever ? I think eventually settle somewhere . And probably happy enough - surely unhappy mediocre marriage . I think wanted companionship , least . One thing struck way listened prattle would meet Monte Carlo . Of course , reserved keeping big secret . But still . In experience , least , abusive oppressive men NOT want listen talk . That ’ one thing I ’ give Maxim - seemed genuinely interested life , least point . ",1
21825,I know older thread I would like suggest reading Rebecca Tale Sally Beauman . The book sequel Daphne du Maurier novel Rebecca officially approved Du Maurier estate ,1
21828,I novel ! ! I n't read parts I read blew mind . It adds depth novel - would narrator felt insecure Rebecca compare ? For example . ,1
21830,"Ooh I need read afterword > My favorite scene last pages novel , narrator dreams Rebecca merging one person , use long hair hang Maxim . She wakes discover Manderley , long-standing symbol Maxim ’ power , flames . So powerful ! ! I must missed dream ! ! I going reread symbolic ",1
21833,"Oooh interesting ! ! So I came conclusion different I n't believe Maxim told truth . Sometimes reading book I wondering narrator telling us everything , tell unhappy keeps lying ball . So , 1 ) Agreed , book named Rebecca 2 . ) I n't believe happened exactly way Maxim says . As much says hated Rebecca even moved Manderly together & claims lying throughout , odd many characters knew Maxim+ Rebecca well noticed unhappiness years Rebecca death . Or case Danvers knew marriage sham believed Maxim genuine love 1st years . 3 . ) I n't believe Maxim ever loved narrator . I think wanted someone compliant , family friends , opposite Rebecca . He claims loved innocence confession gets irritated every time displays . 4 . ) Mrs Danvers manipulates 2 situations max . And even ornament situation , Mrs Danvers n't force Maxim engage conversation stupid wife hid pieces like child front wife . Very unusual behaviour master house publicly scald mistress house servant . Throughout novel wait important conversations servants n't present . That world live . And Danvers n't Maxim awful wife first day Happy Valley beach . Or gets annoyed Monte Carlo stops car opens door tells hop middle nowhere foreign country n't like hears drives back hotel knowing tears . Or marriage proposal involves calling fool admitting brute . It one thing author give us misdirection . It another make one character treat badly , Mrs Van Hooper warning marriage n't great idea sounds like sensible thing says 're reading . 5 . ) We ca n't know exactly . Do n't forget Rebecca often spent nights cottage alone . So nothing particular night meant could predicted Max would follow cottage gun . She midnight picnics & allegedly banging cousin years knowledge never done thing . Maxim n't mention anything particular Rebecca left taunt . 6 . ) We simply ca n't know . This Maxim tells us . Could way easing conscience ? Killing women told pregnant would feel less evil believed used tool final master plan . It comes whether trust believe Maxim honest , reliable character . If , happens . If n't , part novel , wondering Rebecca would told Favell seen note followed , Rebecca really . ",0
21835,"I n't really understand point comment tbh . It ok perceive portraying normal romance , similar many relationships witnessed growing , read tame emotion thriller leave . But say I reading modern sensibilities discovery husband murdered 1st wife believing pregnant less shocking 1930s today untrue . The 1940 Hitchcock film Rebecca , released 2 years book 1st published , turned Rebecca death accident people felt strongly Maxim n't get away murdering women believed pregnant . I sorry witnessed normalised many cold marriages , world * Rebecca * established moment Mrs Van Hooper spots Maxim everyone believed Maxim devoted Rebecca , everyone believed unbelievably loving marriage part made Manderly popular . Spending time glamorous larger life couple . Most people narrator meets shocked different Maxim one things convinces Maxim still love Rebecca . So hard believe I overthinking things novel presents . ",0
21837,"Oh yeah ! ! World War 2 would blown marriage wide open . Maxim drafted . The narrator getting work factories discovering worth . Feeling less place presence war blurred class lines little people classes thrown together . Thank ! ! I used bookworm kid/teenager & I trying rediscover stop scrolling I starting rereading . I reread * Tender night * summer & shocking much went head 18 I like wait As adult . > I always loved 14 yo girl studied book exclaimed outrage : ’ got away murder ’ posh ! She really got heart issue ! ! That thing Favell says * Rebecca * . And narrator acknowledges , comments thank god Favell drunk yelled n't communicate way people Maxim & Colonel Julyan class communicated . You even tell Colonel Julyan realised Maxim guilty & Frank & narrator accomplishes . He could n't look eye . But Maxim position society advises move abroad promises get word Rebecca ill clear name . Which still happens day ! ",1
21842,"Also morning fancy dress ball time novel admits unhappy , marriage n't success Mrs Van Hooper predicted correct , regrets marriage 3 months . It 3/4 days later Manderly burned enters life beginning novel obsesses 3 months Manderly babysitting Maxim affectionless , deflated , aimless without Manderly . The narrator n't even mid-20s living like elderly retired couple . It perfect situation resentment grow , narrator realise year taken advantage . No Manderly servants put show . In controlled conditions , Maxim interpret littlest things way interpreted Rebecca behaviour dispose someone even younger malleable . ",0
21845,I finished book need talk . I hated ending . It took away whole book . I enjoyed everything point . I completely agree needed . It added nothing story . Rebecca clearly wrote make readers upset purpose . And made 1 star . ,0
21846,"Many Gothic romances really build upon helplessness woman involved , rather pitiful array virtues hero , subtle horror situation ( extension , women lives general . ) Rebecca took elements turned unreliable narrative way . If re-read , obvious good old Mr. DeWinter douche Rebecca severe problems definitely bitch ( relationship nanny ? Seriously screwed . ) The unnamed heroine supposedly liberated end , really ? No , still married murderer bonus ptsd . It freaking tragedy oddly enough daughter I discussing regards unreliable narrator . The unnamed heroine misinformed , lying , interesting read second time know secret . ",1
21847,"I think true horror novel corruption main character . At start presented something blank slate . DuMaurier makes big point youth & naivete & kind feels like character arc something hero journey . She emerge book events stronger , sympathetic , less gullible , etc . Instead , see : * Rejoice murder 'rival ' . * Take thought care whether Rebecca really pregnant time fate baby . * Find big moment 'strength ' little ruder staff . * Help cover murder . Because written tight 1st person POV , horror & woman becoming written good & empowering . The ending written something happily ever . But , simply unreliable narration . Of course narrator portray actions justified , even , reading lines , know deeply wrong . Of course claim worth even get glimpse misery caused . We getting side story . ",0
21848,"I sure supposed lot character growth . It inherently unhealthy story two emotionally downtrodden people fall codependent relationship . - Maxim comes man weak-willed streak trapped emotionally abusive marriage , manipulative wife n't love open affairs front including sleeping brother-in-law . When Maxim threatened divorce , told never happen . Then Maxim lashed ultimate violence Rebecca claimed going give birth lover child child would legally considered legally entitled . Then even dead , ca n't rid . His house becomes shrine angel never pretending mourns hateful woman killed . Rebecca , descriptions , seemed savvy enough woman know exactly telling pregnant . It suicide another hand thought could take , probably bonus . She seemed zero remorse actions , red flag ever one . Little fear either , except fear lingering death . The sympathetic descriptions Rebecca come lover Mrs. Danvers , neither impartial . And Mrs. Danvers kept bullying humiliating narrator , mention trying drive suicide , version Rebecca incredibly suspect book full unreliable impressions . So I feel * * sympathy Maxim comes marriage . And lack remorse murder makes sense context abuse victim killing abuser I certainly would n't lose sleep abuser shuffled mortal coil . - As second Mrs. de Winter , comes incredibly lonely person happy even smallest scraps affection , even 're delivered put-downs/verbal abuse husband ( may well learned mistake cruel terms affectionate ones ) . She inferiority complex constantly compares compared false front Rebecca . She thinks plain , foolish , emotionally weak , even characters contradict thoughts . The narrator ends choice really tough staff . Mrs. Danvers insubordinate narrator start , going Maxim orders staff come greet narrator first time . When finally started giving reasonable orders staff , Mrs. Danvers complained n't Rebecca would done . Staff intimidating mistress household n't really something would sympathetic time period . When turns fears based lies husband actually loves , protects . His innocence false , fitting given falseness Rebecca showed world . - By end , narrator Maxim without lies way , beloved house burned , specter Rebecca murder always hover , Mrs. Danvers helped Rebecca triumph one last time tormented life death . ",0
21849,"What stood insecure BOTH main characters . Maxim insecure feels compelled murder wife rather let reputation damaged spends rest life wallowing fear . Mrs. De Winter self conscious timid literally explain husband servants bullying . That ’ , murder revealed , resume loving — ’ perfect match ! They complement ’ insecurities paranoid together . The fantasy kicked book — Maxim pretending worldly , confident man swoops young women feet , Mrs. DeWinter careless young thing devote feelings — shattered . Now exposed , leads codependent kind equal honest relationship . Only poor Rebecca pay price life… ",1
21850,"I really like ! I felt sympathy maxim , find intriguing unkowable rebecca . I honestly side lol . Since dead get maxim side story . As Mrs. de Winter II , I really like story I think low self esteem ? She literally relieved hear husband killed Rebecca , means n't love therefore longer feel jealous ! ! imagine . also , This part genuinly always gives goosebumps : * She made laughs . She laughed like rest . * * * * I known come back sit upstairs bed rock laughter lot * * * ",1
21854,"Of course romance friendship , Maxim chose second Mrs de Winter specifically meekness . He could n't control Rebecca , could n't possess thing , refused ever give even prospect death looming , killed . The second Mrs de Winter exact opposite purpose . She even aware nothing pet - life ? For better obedient pet staid , controlling man luxury world , alone . ",0
21855,"Interestingly , I read ( many times ) I younger , I never thought Maxim problematic . But recently , reading , Maxim seems like pretty awful person . He marries naive , innocent 21-year-old less year murdering wife . I ended thinking may Mrs Danvers point complained watch new wife using Rebecca things soon afterwards . I still adore novel great deal , see Maxim pretty dodgy ! ",0
21857,"At risk boring , I agree completely . Kept waiting spooky moment , , felt let never materialized ! I also found protagonist bit tiresome , n't even get started Maxim . It since I read Rebecca I remember thinking , Right , divorce would absolutely worst thing world , buddy . A young , handsome , wealthy man would NEVER bounce back , much better kill . That said , I find characters Rebecca Mrs. Danvers fascinating would enjoyed hearing backstories . Overall I found Rebecca worth reading , perhaps quite worth hype ",0
21858,"If 're looking spookier version Rebecca I recommend movie I Walked Zombie . Despite ridiculous title atmospheric , literate , eerie drama less Rebecca set West Indies , zombies ( voodoo kind , George Romero gut-munching sort ) . ",1
21859,"I loved reading , I know mean though . It written different time different standards , I wish someone retells Rebecca pov explored relationship Mrs. Danvers ! ! ",1
21861,"Agree points , except I n't think Maxim feels threatened/imprisoned way Rebecca , I n't think ever kill . I n't think accident picked incredibly young , naive , isolated , insecure , devoted woman second wife : convince whatever wants knows wo n't make fuss . I think strongly implied opening chapter live solitary lifestyle Maxim still pretty cold towards ( seems haunted Manderly ) . I n't think narrator happy , ashamed outright admit . ",1
21863,"This old post I seeing take often really baffling people saying Rebecca actually misrepresented Maxim . Other characters story admit awful , Beatrice got sense n't nice pretended , Frank gets incredibly uncomfortable talking ca n't exactly say previous woman bitch , real textual evidence suggest Max lying misrepresenting truth . Danvers obsessed openly says Rebecca cruel , scheming conniving person openly mocked people behind backs pretending nice . That treated people like toys play enjoyed playing games specifically designed hurt . Heck , even bullied disabled bloke threatened send away asylum often enough terrified anytime talks people Manderley 're going institutionalise . If meant reflection character idk else could convince people . I find bizarre clear textual evidence support Max description Rebecca , people pretend victim Max controlling behaviour . By accounts , awful doubt would fit profile pretty disturbing levels traits highly associated personality disorders . I like applying feminist lense literature whenever I , instance seems incredibly misplaced . Does book frame system story takes place oppressive ? Obviously . But represent Rebecca victim system ? Obviously . ",0
21865,I know I late said perfectly I want say Rebecca . Yes I know Maxim nice good persom shit validate Rebecca misunderstood feminist icon ,0
21866,"~I mean~ entire passages literally . Never get attached people 're fan make stupid excuses . Rebecca plagiarized . By white woman resources original Brazilian author , less . These things deserve recognized history , stop trying stifle . Sorry leaves unable romanticize author . The original author also offered A LOT money sign paperwork said work plagiarized things mere coincidences . She refused money . ",0
21868,"My thoughts exactly . I finished reading book yesterday came looking comments . I baffled comments Rebecca praising sort feminist hero . She Max may open marriage arrangement , behavior still went far beyond acceptable behavior . Being discreet affairs supposed part deal , sleeping brother law , trying Manderley staff , getting pregnant alcoholic cousin . There n't one sympathetic character whole book far I concerned , side characters like Frank Ben . I started reading My Cousin Rachel right I finished Rebecca I actually enjoying lot . Her writing seems improved years wrote books every word My Cousin Rachel character says n't Yes No I n't know . ",0
21869,"Yeah I think pretty easy look book feminist lense , protagonist great vessel exclusion femininity womanhood account class used rich , Maxim included , toy tool rather person fun focus analysis . So baffle people desperate say Rebecca misunderstood actual feminist narrative sitting right front us . ",1
21873,"Yep , like I remember seeing people praising fighting patriarchy something reality Max Rebecca mutually used ( Max married thought would improve Manderley reputation , Rebecca unknown n't get see POV Mrs. Danver Jack ( cousin ) mentioned ) . I seen people argued Max gaslighting protagonist tried paint Rebecca worse ( crazy ex tactic ) , even Mrs. Danvers ( biggest fan ) mentioned Rebecca gleeful whisped horse bleed , Jack mentioned passionate romance , Frank Beatrice ( Max sister ) icky interaction due done ( seduced Frank despite n't want also Beatrice husband ) I n't think described far reality ",0
21874,"Yes , exactly . Part wonders people praising Rebecca read book teenagers n't remember details . I know I went back read books I liked I young would hold well due life experience I . When I saw year Daphne Du Maurier wrote book difference My Cousin Rachel terms writing quality , begins make lot sense . It unfortunate anyone would hold Rebecca standard anyone would want think positive way . I know Mrs. Danvers unreliable narrator bully obsessed Rebecca , said align people said behavior . I reading adult went experience similar narrator ways , easy see Rebecca Max . Also easy realize love story , man preyed young insecure woman would n't go another relationship like one Rebecca . ",0
21876,"Jamaica Inn , My Cousin Rachel , The Scapegoat also favorites ! Nothing beats Rebecca , though ",1
21877,"cousin rachel , jamaica inn , birds short stories great dark like rebecca . good . frenchman creek seems like ddm fun . loved . definitely one favorite writers time . ",1

21879,I completely agree . I blown away ! And I cant believe long took discover works outside Rebecca . I finished Frenchman Creek . Like WHAT THE HELL ! . Even short stories 're different amd engrossing way . Really basically unmatched far variety proliferation . Plus everything writes PERFECTLY phrased described . I LOVE seeing appreciation ! ! ! ,1

21885,"Mrs. Danvers burned Manderley , revenge . She realized Maxim must killed Rebecca , even though got legally . It poetic irony everything originally , marrying Rebecca putting infidelity years sake Manderley , promote beauty reputation . He killed keep someone else child inheriting . He sold soul Manderley , speak , Manderley become linked Rebecca ca n't get away . Manderley burning punishment thing needed let finally put Rebecca away completely . Daphne du Maurier considered study jealousy . The protagonists lack name indicative feels invisible overlooked whole time . ",1
21886,"> Who burned Manderley ? Mrs. Danvers burned Manderly super protective Rebecca , felt second Mrs. de Winter disgrace disapproved love . > I think character could development .

21913,"This favorite book time I ready fight ! ( Mostly kidding , different strokes different folks . ) I say I strongly disagree 're supposed root Maxim second wife . Our narrator certainly wants us , ultimately I think du Maurier created heroine 're supposed empathize * * critical . * Rebecca * , , psychological examination pitfalls insecurity , codependence , relationships imbalanced power dynamic . I also disagree de Winters came top . Again , something narrator trying convince us , opinion insecure admit miserable . And Maxim seem miserable : love ever , n't seem care beginning . They home roam city city , constantly run , Manderley haunting narrator dreams . ( However , I agree I wish n't gotten away it—well , I * * wish narrator would strength character turn husband , would next best thing . ) Finally , note Jane Eyre comparisons : I think du Maurier wrote response Jane Eyre , I n't think wrote retelling . Instead , I think commenting number elements sees dangerous . In novels , massive power imbalance hero heroine : hero significantly older , romantically experienced , well-situated financially socially , heroine young , naïve , friendless , penniless . Jane Eyre strong enough character , Rochester willingness show humility treat equal , relationship able overcome challenges . But narrator * Rebecca * insecure lonely , Maxim apparently interested keeping around likes adored , relationship unhappy corrupting one . > The main character becomes empowered AFTER HER HUSBAND CONFESSES HE MURDERED REBECCA . WTF . It quick sudden reeked insecurity I definitely agree . For , big twist : Maxim murdered Rebecca ( I saw coming fairly early ) , narrator reaction . All told , I love novel despite , narrator . I identify strongly many personality traits , seeing recognized explored page incredibly cathartic freeing…and also gave lot think . I also really love du Maurier prose atmospheric writing style—gothic settings favorite , nothing ever topped Manderley . Shame n't love , thanks starting discussion ! ",1

21924,"I finished reading evening affected novel , especially rollicking third act . Loved neuroses narrator , complexity Danvers evil , ENDING . Like hitting brick wall - I forgotten destruction outlined first two chapters point . I side De Winter , committed out-and-out murder insight crime sympathetic POV wife . Rebecca seems fairly cruel person ( threatening Ben asylum , whipping horse bleeds , constant cheating , mocking servants , hanging/banging gross cousin , etc . ) If narrator masochist , Rebecca seems sadist . But may abusive spouse , n't justify crime murder . Especially since De Winter knew . She told awful things ( sensibilities least ) done five days marriage chose stay would good manager beloved Manderley . That n't want go divorce , social reasons . He made bed one . And fact De Winter n't tell wife loves UNTIL confesses Rebecca murder could read relationship really starting truly honest ( also seems first time bone ? ) But given passionless relationship described opening chapters , seems like desperate manipulative ploy keep new Mrs. De Winter corner . The narrator POV wants make us love , get end look back hard see anything criminal ( accessory fact ) run . Curious people thoughts one detail : I read Rebecca provoking Maxim assisted suicide . We told n't type go slowly via lingering disease , fit combative personality . I n't think expected Maxim come confront , saw opportunity take advantage . She lied adulterous pregnancy suggest giving Manderley heir outside family . Essentially destroying Manderley , sole reason brought life begin . The betrayal sure provoke attack , weathered betrayals point . BUT case - going discuss cousin Favell , suggested note ? Was another option man enrage killing ? He certainly seems type ( I assume Danvers orchestrated destruction Manderley together . ) ",1
21926,"Hell , even copy book advertises romance ! I remember first interactions protagonist Maxim , thinking romance ? He mocks cruel . Him reserving affection marriage reveals murder seems manipulative came sexist ( rants women , proclaiming would kill Rebecca talked days wedding seemingly charitably n't ) cruel . Also , saying h preferred new wife naïve , innocent , left without understanding certain things gross . When I finished book , I felt disgusted I supposed find romantic . Reading backstory made realize I may reading 'correctly ' along . Dapne du Maurier intended book jealousy horrified people viewed romance . I wonder , beyond marketing , one could read romance . There , , romantic scenes overall take scenes combine everything cancel romantic aspects , leaving abuser finds poor young girl marry , manipulate , mold . ",0
21929,"oh ffs . When sex someone highest form intimacy vulnerability ( well used casual sex became norm ) . You think gay ? There reason abstained wife ? He n't sleep wife confession bottled , afraid losing composure worked hard build murdering Rebecca might break , confess wife lose woman ever truly loved .

I think narrator bit pain ass , always lost situation feeling pity - I remind 21 , high society world really intimidating . I finished 2 days ago , I also read seeing many recommendations - I agree , I n't see one major plot twist . I expecting Rebecca lesbian affair Mrs. Danvers , crazy obsession ! ",1
21948,"I love novel I read re-read every time I feel something new . I love themes everyone , including author , keeps making comparison Rebecca , different ways . Does Rebecca win , Maxim says ? Her shadow cast future couple , forever . The author dreams often . Or Rebecca lose lost life , Max continued living , better person ? ",1

Menderley stressed . I felt constantly watched judged employees . The times I could relax went Happy Valley n't compare Rebecca even ruined revealed Rebecca smells like azaleas valley . From beginning I side-eying Maxim . Why MC watch every word around prevent upsetting ? It gets worse story goes . Maxim patronizes like child business .

And end , cloak Such A Tragedy ! excuse bad moods bad manners . ",1
21967,"Absolutely yes ! I think Rebecca retelling Jane Eyre . I excited find conversation . It point point story time exact inverse Jane Eyre . Only masterful writer could done thing . My favorite part way girl Rebecca never named . The titular character Maxim wife . That inverse Jane Eyre . Although Jane says obscure , really force reckoned girl Rebecca seems bullied everyone beginning book end . Jane shining heroine whereas girl Rebecca feels never live Rebecca . The house figuratively haunted Rebecca memory , Thornfield Well I n't know hide spoilers . I love read point point comparison . I find fascinating . ",1
21969,"That pretty different interpretation ones I heard . Yes , neither Rochester Maxim perfect , 're typical Byronic grey characters , 're also different characters , Jane Rebecca protagonist . But describing nothing manipulated victims disservice . And I would n't call either Rochester Maxim evil , victims circumstances . Well , Rochester lot . He deceived wife family apparently wanted profit good marriage wealthy man pretty much selling mentally ill daughter away , apparently aggressive abusive , even could n't help . Rochester could sent asylum ( treated horribly , since proper mental health treatment n't thing 19th century ) chose instead take care . He also took girl ex-lover sent , even though doubted . I n't think called bad person relative time lived . He n't plan seducing governess , contrary , n't exactly nice first . I defending lying wife , like I said , circumstances bit different . And Jane vicrim , intelligent , chose mind right thing left . She returned years later , . In Maxim case , course murdering wife n't defensible , new wife really naive girl prospects life married first man could give good name status . But grow lot . Maxim case trapped fucked marriage abusive wife gaslit fuck , final moments practically goaded killing . She knew cancer , wanted die , told Maxim became final straw - implied pregnant child n't child one day inherit Manderley ruin . ",1
21971,"An interesting take . Upon reading biography du Maurier , I much clearer understanding Rebecca . I think du Maurier intended Maxim true villain . A reading Rebecca villain plays sexism present time du Maurier ’ writing . I agree Maxim ’ account appears Rebecca vile creature , ’ point . It Maxim ’ account painted Rebecca way . Presumably independent woman easily controlled husband . ",1
21980,"Yeah I actually similar experience . I first read 13 thought pure evil . But I ’ recently reread thought yes , manipulative controlling , especially towards men , almost seemed like vigilante feminist act since time men thing women totally commonplace . I ’ know , something really cool ! One things I think expertly done book way died ; husband murdered - seems like control . But , know , Rebecca tricked committing act suicide , like always expertly manipulated men exactly wanted . Such cool power play ! ",1
21982,"I agree everyone else said , plus talk Manderley . This Maxim ancestral estate , loves , identity tied . It Manderley kept silent marriage Rebecca , affairs , n't try divorce would caused scandal , would brought disrepute family name also estate , physical embodiment name family heritage . Rebecca simultaneously brings Manderley greater state beauty repute ever , pollutes . Because Manderley Maxim , real way , also polluted , sold soul sake reputation pride . Until ends killing , way could keep reputation get rid Rebecca . When Maxim meets girl , Europe . They 're away Manderley , probably feels free , falls love girl every way opposite psychotic wife . He thinks marrying begin , make life pure fresh innocent , wipe away stain marriage Rebecca everything entails . But , course , ca n't long stay Europe , 're sort playing house , pretending . Once actually takes back , finds Rebecca really gone . She everywhere Manderley , beautiful estate used home pride refuge instead constant reminder guilt , awful things took place . He thought killing Rebecca , could keep everything good Manderley get rid bad , case . This Manderley burn end . As long existed , would continue reminder Maxim terrible marriage Rebecca , Maxim seared forever changed . There Manderley without Rebecca anymore , Maxim without Rebecca .

22332,"I read * The Secret History * ago - long speak authoritatively towards details post . But I visceral memory reading novel honestly one absolute favorites . Probably due re-read . I sometimes flippantly refer rose-colored glasses : book . I think lot power work comes none secondary characters change through-out story . Rather changes lens protagonist views . Initially , everything dripping pathos group olive branch normalcy friendship . Then later cracks start show idyll lifted show broken terrible people . People play exalted language enlightenment unworthy basic fellowship . In guessing third fourth points , though , I think Richard strongly empathize Charles even point seeing Camilla sister , sexual attraction . Perhaps reason many men attracted another element parting veil - nothing changed Richard became aware super uncomfortable audience proxy .

With death , characters lifted fog blasé , eventually becoming fully aware harsh truths reality . Then setting . Or rather , nature setting . The fact main gang studies classical literature huge impact world novel . The text packed references allusions different classical works , post-classical pieces sprinkled . This combined almost blatantly obvious disregard literature immediately preceding decades . By ignoring sort influence writers like Garcia Marquez , Julian Barnes Günter Grass , Donna Tartt creates sort microcosm temporal limbo , dictated period Homer Sylvia Plath . ( Wow went pretentious But I point ! Bear . ) From clues ’ given , ’ pretty safe say novel takes place late 1900s , clues give us delightful contrast modern flighty , ancient ever lasting .

In vein , could see reflects deal shock Richard Charles Ryder entered odd world rich obscure . The narrators describe , according Charles , profane memories nostalgic nauseatingly sweet manner . Funny enough , Waugh since written form apology self deprecating introduction book describing disgust nostalgia glorification decadence ( funny Richard start stay college murder ) . Both books overtones religious nature opinion . The one desire paganistic lifestyle , well , actual practice free spirit roaming . Both doesnt reflect catholic lifestyle . Both end operation divine force , Waugh said Brideshead . Surprisingly enough , sinners punished everything goes drain . Both books . If divine operation , Waugh meant strict justice karma I agree .

I wo n't pretend even basic knowledge Greek mythology , I think characters , motivations actions understood exist within [ Apollonian-Dionysian dichotomy ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_and_Dionysian ) . Julian props Apollonian framework ( self-satisfied reason logic ) within select group mostly privileged , arrogant students able establish scholarly , elitist identity , guiltlessly rationalize egoistic actions . Richard yearns escape family/class background , throughout much book seeks gain acceptance inside Julian inner sanctum , buying facade , helping group struggle Dionysian forces ( Bunny , later Charles ) , always assuming applies reason logic unraveling group secrets , something reasonable logical discover , especially regard Henry role philosopher-mastermind . This , course , n't case . The group , secrets emotional state members heavily stressed actual applications logic , namely law enforcement . By end , revealed early Henry seduced Dionysian impulses , much behavior Richard assumed carefully plotted rational fact chaotic emotional . And Julian Apollonian framework kind evaporates .

The protagonist bit vacant though . I pretty certain Henry killed farmer , fully remember . At least I think works best group go fully savage . The entire book faking til make , protagonist pretends like Classics group fits , Classics group pretend cult genuinely become one . Bunny arse probably human character , I found interesting even knowledge would happen .

22426,"I completely agree everything wrote . I spent September reading bunch dark academia books ( I read The Secret History 10+ years ago reread regularly incredible ! ) If We Were Villains slam-dunk I like genre I studied Shakespeare uni , n't nearly good I expected . The best dark academia book I read last month These Violent Delights Micah Nemerever , strong writing believable queer love story . Give try !

22430,It interesting I finished today . I thought I going devour I took couple breaks ( weeks ) reading . It one books I read I barely highlights notes . It full Shakespearean quotes n't much original good lines makes sense . It probably good choice I read first Secret History . I kinda already felt better I gave one shot recos . I actually liked Dangerous Girls We liars If villains . You 're right predictable . The revelation also barely revelation . ,1
22431,"I agree We Were Villains pretty one dimensional characters , I would n't say predictable IMO . But The Secret History one best books I ever read , prose stellar , I n't expect If We Were Villains come close . You 're comparing popcorn book literary fiction . If We Were Villains younger , dumber cousin . The Likeness Tana French proves better written , ans vein , TSH unmatched . I recommend pick backlist Margaret Atwood scratch itch . Surfacing * amazing * packs much examine neat 250 pages . Do n't hate pay full price book hate ? ? ( 20 $ less full price Canada though ¯⁠\⁠_⁠ ( ⁠ツ⁠ ) ⁠_⁠/⁠¯ ) . ",0

My sister read If We Were Villains , gave five stars , I looking pad GoodReads reading challenge bit , I gave another shot . Oi . The prose awful . It reads like worst fan fiction . The characters ’ even wooden , ’ like wet cardboard . The depiction conservatory theatre program vague poorly drawn , Shakespeare quotes groaning every line .

22441,"As someone read 'The Secret History ' first , I excited read books 'dark academia ' genre . What letdown book , I DNFed 100 pages , read andoff three months . ",0
22443,I agree . I read „ The secret history “ first I really struggled finish „ If villains “ . The characters hollow whole time I felt like author copied TSH . ,1
22444,"I definitely agree ! ( part 1 ) \-TSH IFWV completely different books , likened mostly marketing reasons . TSH satirical book obsession using knwoledge way creating harsher class divisions , really * class * . IFWV tragedy teather sense , means beginning know happens outcomes ca n't changed , * identity * . In TSH characters want kill Bunny relatively stupid reasons , convince necessary , want , nobody pays 're rich priviledges white kids - real twist book would going jail . Their lives fall apart * make * fall apart , especially feel guilty killing Bunny- n't give damn , 're self-centered . In IFWV James want kill Richard , none wanted see dead , even though extremely unlikable straight violent dangerous . The murder accident , one ends paying everyone lives crumble , awful thing happened . As setting yes , . But like , The Great Gatsby The Catcher Rye set New Jork , n't mean anything . \- Saying Shakespeare listed co-author quotes scenes enact like saying Homer listed co-author The Song Achilles . Be real , 're actig scenes n't mean * meaning * * context * scenes . The interesting thing book actually see personal lives actors bleed Shakespearian scenes portraying . The author n't add show knows Shakespear Madeline Miller followed story Iliad TSOA show knows Homer . Also yeah , characters quote Shakespeare every sentence 're annoying obsessed theater kids ! They live breathe Shakespeare , school slightly cultu-ish , I n't know ever hung theater kids I tell , musical theater cast irl went characters , would 100 % * singing * lines Hamilton Les Mis . It slightly amped literary purposes . And right beginning , MC talking cop realize everyone outside context thinks cringe . And fair , * Secret History people talk Ancient Greek cringe Hell * ( mention unlikely ? I wo n't get ) icon queen boss bitch Judy Poovey makes clear . \-The book n't male gazey , 're experiencing POV * male MC * , attracted Meredith also spends book trying convince yeah totally attracted Meredith female woman breasts soft lips totally attracted male roommate . We know , part conflict story fact everyone seems see way , taken habit presenting femme fatale role assigned . But I come back . Also standards TSH male gazey - shall talk Richard sees Camilla ? Talk one dimentional . It part first person narrator , see characters way narrator . \-IFWV tragedy , big revelations tragedies . That tragedies : tragedies stories begin characters relatively happy ends pain suffering . What 're probably thinking dramas , aka stories characters happy beginning , encounter obstacles suffering throughout story , eventually ends well . Most Ancient Greek plays tragedies , goes Shakespeare . So point tragedies , ? To quote Hadestown ( annoying theater kid ) : * To know ends/And still begin sing again/As might turn time . * Which still keep retelling Greek Myths . ML Rio Shakespearean play Greek myth . The tragedy book ( happens every tragedy anyway ) characters made different choices , communicated better , none would happened . You 're supposed know two male leads romantic feelings one another , part tragedy yelling book dumb idiots n't talk , none would happen ? . Also stop yelling queerbaiting ! time stories n't specifically state charaters ' sexual orientations n't explore sex relationships physical way - especially inability cope feelings one another causes downfall . Good representation n't representation à la Heartstopper , * * also pretty good representation . God knows queer person I know n't ambiguous relationship close friend figuring . And matter , TSH Richard name , tall twink , Francis . ",0

22464,"This interesting ! Based comments post , seems like many readers drawn beginning book rather end . I sped book Vegas section . Once I made Vegas , I found particularly unmotivated read . Tartt ’ descriptions excessive drinking made feel literally sick stomach ( , one could say , compliment writing ) . I ’ found common criticism Goldfinch Theo ’ lack deliberate action : life happens rather creating life . I loved aspect Theo character . To , made seem much human . I felt character well-developed . Boris Mrs. Barbour beautifully developed well . And I n't know I loved character much I loved Hobie . I read final 200 pages one sitting . Generally , I think events novel took place reader hoped would . This left satisfied slightly unmoved ? I curious anyone else experienced . That said , I still loved book !

22469,"I writing 16 days post made figure I contribute anyway . I come love book . I listened audiobook treacherous . It like 35 hours long Tartt writing detailed sometimes meandering . I almost dropped halfway many parts mundane things described detailed way . I remember part characters shopping plateware something I could n't get . I glad I , I think characters really thought complex , probably book I ever read . For , magic Tartt writing explicitly said page rather implied nuance . You grasp things characters , pasts , happened time jumps without explicitly telling . And Tartt perfected Secret History . Some people n't like direction took book last 3rd I really enjoyed utter despair twists turns . This book The Secret History interesting main characters pretty similar kinda bland , supporting characters colorful interesting . The movie adaptation good 're looking end adaptation n't book justice . However , film beautifully shot master Roger Deakins fun see locations characters brought life certain scenes . I thought film well casted book really quite expansive n't work way . ",1

The stint desert I found especially magnetic strange , I ’ fascinated Las Vegas like nexus evil . It ’ definitely coherent The Secret History , I enjoyed differing structure . To ! As far finding Theo boring , I get — I found Richard Papen somewhat boring . I think Tartt tends write certain kind protagonist , ’ somewhat dull middle-class boy thrown high stakes , high-money scenarios . ",1

22496,"The Goldfinch probably favourite book time . It contemporary novel I read gave feeling Dickens , Tolstoy etc . I younger : relishing language , beauty , taking time . I loved living Theo , know I mean . It vogue write short , minimalist sentences , imply everything , bunch soulless clever characters , I get tired quickly . The Goldfinch rich satisfying chocolate cake . And funny I always thought Secret History compelling read , page-turner , Goldfinch complicatedly good . It literary novel , I think , I wish n't making damn movie . The Secret History , hand , would make excellent film , alas . Anyway , blabbering Tartt , least , greatest living author .

The prose beautiful . But plot lacking , character hollow shell . So I admire virtues , I n't like book . ",0
