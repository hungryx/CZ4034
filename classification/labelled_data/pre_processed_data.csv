time perhaps even 50 time harassed picture body particularly breast belittled play like girl suck girl like gender anything even performance within game match outmatches rest team not best video game visual impairment hurt fps reaction speed terrible sometimes within time video gaming community seen people try literally buy female using ingame currency item equivalent learning gender 50 plat girlfriend anyonewhile hilarious also concerned treat female like commodity bought sold think know thats problem thats happening world centuriesit not say video gaming community completely sexist despite mainly male sometimes salty not say men fault sometimes girl meaner female victim met best friend boy girl lovely rainbow inbetween including girlfriend love video game still play ridiculous amount video gameshowever ready player one maintains almost celebrates sort problematic sexist culture within video gaming society well not really addressing problem could go but today want address

transphobic otherwise perhaps thats not ernest mean write claim passage really lean towards suggestionand fact parzival seems almostthreatening art3mis answer question thats also concerningit also make wonder wade never internet lot troll people real nasty people may hide behind mask fake identity various reason aech potential lot development but instead becomes sort throwaway charactera lot game problematic term gender like admit overwatch issue wow outfit sometimes geared toward male gaze gtav thing sometimes but concern thisthis book feel us lot fluff hide fact really serious issue people claim literary fun yes gtav gaming culture issue but least certain company like riot blizzard try take step acknowledge harassment even slow no easy solution but dont try cover vlrstlu book doesbut ernest cline especially try claim book friendly not sexist clearly us fluff hide problem claim transparent flimsy passage try claim everything okaythere also well known poem nerd porn auteur not sfw ill leave but concerning welli say thisif sexist transphobic hold unpopular opinion fine right thought opinion right agree disagree but dont try delude people arentand even somethings funny

greatly enjoyed dune currently reading one sequel agree point but not specifically agree issue pacing found ending bit rushed could fleshed quite bit not get much better dune messiah im currently reading still quite big leap forward timei also noticed borrowing arab term aesthetic fremen im not sure chalking racism correct though read maybe kind cheap way underlining desert theme really evoking desert imagery reader disagree point world building character little context exposition term supposed meanwouldnt suck fun exploring world every single element make world unique explained last little detail least fun reading scifi fantasy matter precisely discovering odd element trying understand context story ask could describe paul personality without describing chosen one son duke think point one point paul character not human normal psyche nor many character paul mentat human computer trained birth conduct fully logical conclusion input knowledge experience literally trained not factor emotion action thus there little opportunity emotional growth could manifest action yet still strong emotion concerning future see vision struggle greatly emotionally logically he seen,1
massive lord ring fan read series least 15 time lifetime but no matter try can not get hobbit think enjoyed first time guess but mindlessly boring rush book fast possible knowing treasure come lord ring,0
victor frankenstein absolutely tragic character right suggest view action lens but no mean make innocent best blas overconfident negligent worst arrogant inhuman idiotically reckless either way blame creation action fall squarely court law would likely receive consideration leniency due unsound mental state factor ie grief but would still squarely found guilty,0
