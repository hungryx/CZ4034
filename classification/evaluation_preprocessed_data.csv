also fully agree movie way deeper book stephen king wrote story haunted hotel kubrick not trying directly adapt shining but rather use vehicle explore theme generational trauma atrocity committed humanity over de genocide familial abuse im not saying book didnt explore thing well but much le abstract thought provoking kubrick movie wasnt exploring human condition way kubrick feel like looking movie lens book trying make sense movie book believe wrong way looking kubrick no intention directly adapting l included several specific detail show audience think look movie book two completely different entity valued rately different reason personally movie one favorite time incredibly well kubrick us element book stripped original intent create not new story but well create allegory explore theme historical atrocity continue over time way beyond surface level event happened overlook think mistaking shallowness trying view movie lens book never going work movie actually like super notorious amount deeper meaning layered far understand book not inspire even close kind analysis movie book attempted character study movie never attempted even second thats not story kubrick trying tell,1.0

alternative take great movie adaption achieved wise confident change id rather watch shining remotely safe 11 adaption wonderful reinvention personally find compelling there also nothing generic shining,1.0
finished reading shining recently watched movie first timei not know king disliked movie but make perfect sense exact issue shining main character flawed but clearly love family especially son movie never even hint love danny one scene say much love tense dannys actor clearly uncomfortablethe movie honestly different feel better thing reading shining first time not seen movie except iconic scene kept expecting see elevator blood scene little girl calling danny none exists book whole last 14 unique film personally helped distance even head,1.0
felt read shining isnt favorite king book but totally sympathize feeling like movie erased jack merit took away lot wendys agency think king hate much book also personal see character story portrayed made audience think story written wasnt dont think adaptation need symmetric source text shining excellent piece art right main problem movie stanley kubrick bad person human level psychological abuse cast crew particularly shelley duvall make hard love movie dont care good film making kubrick major prick think thats another reason king hated much dishonest portrayal character wrote regardless good reinvention environment production hostile hell totally understand emotion king but unfortunately admit film still excellent piece cinema fuck kubrick though,0.0
im know im biased movie one favorite favorite horror movie hand grain saltbut think unfair call kubrick shining generic haunted house movie slow burn tension amazing practical effect feeling offkilter whole film even subtext may may not included kubrick may may not meant interesting agree movie not reflect book well but hard translate book visual medium not lose something know proof 1997 stephen king wrote produced tv mini series based l involved pretty much every aspect series gave u version shining visual medium productand dull not awful character development much better woman play wendy age better shelley duvall opinion weakest part kubrick version but remains drawn slightly boringand look dr sleep nt enough l but movie thought messy saccharine kubrick notorious cutting source material fit end look controversy surrounding clockwork orange but dont think diminishes merit version shining like think movie distillation king l go long way king recommends storytelling show dont tell,1.0
